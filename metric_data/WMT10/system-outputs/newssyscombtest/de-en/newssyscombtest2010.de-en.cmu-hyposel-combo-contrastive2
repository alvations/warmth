Lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owner
Scneelose runways are not only the giant mountains in the vicinity.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and guest houses.
So you can get in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited the country.
The people, the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to deliver.
And if they call us to ask whether it immediately, in our view, this year's Christmas on snow Matsch "or" will be led by the operators of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
The New Year's Eve stay in the spin-offs Del mill just after his ideas like that should no longer with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers to save and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners offer now for the New year's Eve day mostly only weeks stays on.
I think that they will seek to sell them, but then they must also give in, and for shorter periods.
And then the free room quickly wither, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always, the travel agency Ingtours in vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our program is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas were prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can also offer, but here, there are fewer free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter visits also negatively affected by that Giant is still no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the Pisten within a week, will also be sold out before Christmas, says.
Conversely, and slightly better than in the last year, manages to fill the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas Day, we only have a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in the janua, and in February, the business as well, the director of the best hotels Pec, Karel rada.
About 80 per cent of the New Year's Eve stays is also the Omnia hotel in central car park in Janske Lazne occupied.
However, remains at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 percent.
A bit weaker is now the february, but at the moment, when the snow comes, is the interest in the placements in giant, the director of the hotels omnia, Erik sporysch.
On a more snow mess, the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday it should be cool and if there is rain, snow on the mountains.
But then again, a global warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue, he repeatedly, even for the stupid.
When he finally his gaze longingly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it emerged that he is on the Kopierpapier from the Bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that, in the text itself, he repeatedly used the phrase "as" in Iraq, he has even the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new way forward", without hesitation.
He has even three years of the Bush idea - fresh troop contingents in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military lands that the only possible and was very successful in that it is now in the news about iraq no longer.
The Bush's reputation has not improved because objectively, his successor, he has a much dankbarere starting position behind, as it was to be expected.
In afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have asked him again the military, especially the Oberkommandeur the afghanistan-operation General Stanley mccristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten the hesitation to protect severely criticised in the White house.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President postponed for three months, but it is no better idea and he has the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise of another 5,000, even if he originally forecast at least 10,000.
Highly problematic for The whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine has left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders pay tribute to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation - it can rely on no one and there are no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, that leaves only scheinbauten, behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen will make further out.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions of the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimum objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his charitable
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the young soldiers in the war cries from the "frühheimkehr" broke out here is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, which is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans, to participate in the war in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians can and do not want their voters also say that the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush mountain buffer zone.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also have a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only sop for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election, and, therefore, there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls this would prove a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses in cash bonuses
The chief executives of the us bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year more in cash.
The company announced to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive the money instead of equities, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares of the managers in the case, if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is in accordance with the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium of Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former bankers society jp morgan, Douglas elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after it for the first three quarters of this year, almost 17 billion dollars for Prämienboni had set aside.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses during the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today, despite the measure likely exceed $20 billion.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends the bonuses of bankers, the 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota in the cabinet of the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in the public finances.
In addition to the meeting informed of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On another wants to remain in his post on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget bill, which is now Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals for money, and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal Party, on the other hand, is a sharp domestic political dispute, transformed the question mark over the future work of the fishermen officials cabinet, on the of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by parliament, the package of austerity measures, the fish 'government in the autumn, and that the public debt.
Klaus, the law on the state budget, but not sign, said today in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the leaders of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances have neglected, a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still rely on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ods, Mirek topolanek, said that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The UDF deputy chairman, Petr Necas, CTK said that the concept of the Staff cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier fishermen called in the task of drafting similar words as "strong".
The CSSD leader Jiri paroubek, responded to the Topolanek said that the budget deficit is terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday rated the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "invictus: the ungeschlagene" of the world shows that much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson mandela, in his life history of the American actor oscar, Morgan freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood- film.
A further important role, matt damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The two -year-old actor, the price for his role in the Eastwood-drama from the box area had received "Million Dollar Baby", was the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end of the slave owners, a fictional US president, and also in "Evan omnipotent God", but only rarely, someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African leader was for his active career in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was issued in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film recounts a true story, The Nelson Mandela his forces with The captain of The South African rugby team, Francois pienaar, leading to some of The country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically divided.
He believes that he can agree people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders, the world.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years, the Mandela history at the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role, as closely as possible to the reality, said freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he does.
The actor said, if he and the world would be in the same country, he would try to meet with mandela to eat with him and, in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake hands.
I have noticed that when I give you the schüttele, I accept your energy, it will, and I had the feeling that I know what they are feeling, he said.
It is important to a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the world rugby.
It was a big surprise for him, when he met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door bell that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: 'in the film, I see a lot more'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has, under the leadership of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" positive and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the film reviews on the Web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus 76 percent received positive evaluations.
Light on norway: The Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted that only yesterday near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch was not successful and the type of "bulava" rocket, which was originally the pride of the Russian army should be, is the nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime minister, Vladimir putin.
His repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or have been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers about "bulava" than a "missile, which is not flies."
A missile, which is not a fee, but
This is already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Until the end of the flight, in turn, requires technical damage to the rocket.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missiles will enable the delivery of the submarine.
It is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified fliegendes object on Northern ways the damaged "bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals, diesesmal challenged and claimed that it is not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without error, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence, only six of 13 for unsuccessful.
Almost 50 per cent of the success that the generals met with optimism and so will continue to claim that the "Bulava" even without problems, and even fly to ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: A substance, which also works in gestählt Dell Dell HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the drawback is that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
However, their income will be accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus, also has the development sg. resistentviren, against the medicines are no more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences cr, of the VSCHT (chemisch-technologische seminary) prague, as well as of the University in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus-resistenz.
They have shown that the substances on the protein known as Metalokarborane, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new 'improved' links, on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their commitment to the viral protein material were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor -, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
It is insidious and maintainable virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of the HIV virus, which for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV virus caused by the HIV virus division would not be Infektionsvirenpartikel mature.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the researchers explain in the press, the report by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences, CR.
In the work in the Science paper was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the researchers describe a series of compounds, in which two couples of the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then continues systematically.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested, including their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzym-variante is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against the use of medicines often ineffective.
The unique mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical impact, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective drugs against HIV, research, says Pavlina rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the fighting
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, in his view, should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong Aussprüche."
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, officials said that the concept of the cabinet, with the support of the ODS and CSSD, Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to do in the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the Parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, pointed out.
Parliament has on Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, but with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should come with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetprovisoriums frase not clear.
Frustration and futility.
The Finance Minister, Eduard janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event would have threatened that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
In accordance with the Czech television has on Monday after the premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
So is his disappointment at the Verhandugn of the budget.
The fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Nominanten Necas the Social Democrats (CSSD), the enforced changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament will continue to attract deficit to adopt laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the Dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were wrong not to
That is a matter for the Prime minister, fishermen and the government.
The ODS nominated ministers have made no mistake, Topolanek said in a text message from the United states.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function, who are at the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decides on the fight against the level of deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament".
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said the citizens of the Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak journalists in parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime minister.
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Prime Minister, the Members of the public Democrats explicitly ask that they would allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic has not diminished.
I have not noticed that my vote.
Even when I dropped to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positive, would react, Topolanek itself.

One of the biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, at the moment, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem ones.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The long distance routes in the capital will be in the end goal-station Prague main station.
The CD is more lines SC Pendolino trains between Prague and Ostrava and the after Sumperk/Jesenik, in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, a total of the railways to reimburse the so-called Liquiditätsverlusts in the next year four billion kronor, gene as this year, the Local trains supply the districts, they have to pay for a total of eight billion kronor in the next year, with the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains, the railways a ten-year contract newly completed, until now, the Treaty is only for a year.
The railways praises the system, perhaps it is not part of the increase in the price of the vast majority of the tickets.
To changes, it is only in one-day netzfahrscheinen CD net and favourable internetfahrscheinen eliska.
For passengers without the customer card will increase the price of CD Net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will depend on the stecke, until now, he was for travel between any district towns and cost 160 kroner.

Jancura sues for libel proceedings against three head of the cssd.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura today, charged in criminal proceedings for libel against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute interest view in the radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions, but at the end of the long-term contracts signed with the Czech railways.
All three are attacking us and say that we pick the cherries, we have made the offer only on the size, as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, which were completed last week.
So, we have no choice but to defend.
Because of this defamation of the society student Agency, said Jan worry about the Radio Journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection for the continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura him as free advertising for his company, as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I would urge other head on.
I assume that this matter will also be clear that it is jancura, in the cause of the Regionaleinsenbahnverkehrs public manipulated and used false and untrue arguments, said hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kronor in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts.
The Radio Journal, he said that he supported the campaign after Christmas, and it intends to continue after the New Year.
He added that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has begun Jancura after the districts at the behest of the regional rail transport agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a High 150 billion kronor had no invitations to tender.
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and incompatible with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a Member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we do that we can lose the buslizenzen.
He was a member of the CSSD before, I know who it is, I am not saying his name, said the Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily.
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January, the usual.
It is a first for the families to be free and voluntary.
But now voices reported that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokken.
The Institute of Medicine sets the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination.
Vaccines for August, children free of charge
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not yet received.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be taken between 3 and 5 living month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families of their children inoculated against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns, and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses are needed.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities from 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
They save, but the treatment of the children without vaccination.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around $500,000 per year.
The deal was struck with the so-called Janota-Paket introduced.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections, including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die in our investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
The vaccination programme will be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be in the future requirements.
From January to be paid for by the insurance and be voluntary.
That, the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association nahlas, Rudolf kalovsky.
His association has been touted for the Pneumokokken vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the International Conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we have to go now, kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health, but the Impfverfahren against Pneumokokken does not change.
At this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors say.
The chairman of the society of practical kinderärzten, Hana cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then we could reflect on the reduction of the Wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their babies against Pneumokokken from next year.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is ground-breaking, adding that this was the first by the health insurance paid for and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for the prevention, in order to save them for further treatment, erkärt cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical kinderärzte, linked to the purchase of vaccines.
Under the original plan, the vaccines are purchased by the insurance companies and doctors should receive it in the same way, as well as other issued by the state to make vaccines.
Some Members were, however, that the insurance, "the money from the health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors themselves and buy the vaccines have to wait for the insurance companies to pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says.
We still have them.
The form of Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. "
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building voted for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report written about whether Muslims in one of the avowedly secular societies can be integrated into Europe -- and be integrated.
Some readers of this new book admiration for the last work of the author: "why the French no scarves love" (originaltitel: "why the French don 't Like Headscarves') (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a dispute that the country has one and a half decades and employees and their effects are still to play.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in france, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which is now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in france, as Bowen calls "islamic".
He is a good listener, debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or in a City Hall (or both)?
Young Muslims should be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman to marry a Muslim man?
It is permissible for a Muslim, a banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, born in Switzerland of Arab Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, questioned the bowen, are usually at odds with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia - which is a small but influential presence among europe's muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
He queries whether the French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be rougher treatment as catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees more of a "tightening the screws" values "as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."

The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other on earth.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and life that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, is in "On thin ice" (original title: "On thin ice"), a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
In the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher who wrap themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich at sea, only with the Gewehrkolben his Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.

Ironically, in the waters in the north of the two nations the ice longest remain.
In his new book, "after the ice" (original title "after the ice") offers Alun anderson, a former editor of the science magazine new scientist, "a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight as to how the future could develop.

The U. S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities.
The Cuban government has a contractor for the us government, mobile phones and Notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on saturday.
The contractor, has not yet been identified, working for Development alternative Inc. with headquarters in bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the charge of "threat" can be arrested.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include an easy protests and critical writings, carries a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements could be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably be the tension between the communist government of Fidel Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama to increase the "slow" approach to improve relations with the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was first proposed by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and Notebook in Cuba are legal, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees is $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows ordinary citizens, since this year, the purchase of a mobile phone, but they will be used for the fact that text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and work for foreign visitors and some government departments, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to see the government often have their names.
Too many Web access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few of us citizens in cuba, who are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria berbena, the spokesman in the us-interessenvertretung in havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other legally free society - the free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, "the recently launched a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title of" new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel Castro.
Vivanco said that the defendants, often within a day, were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, especially at a time when both countries for more dialog move closer together.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope the case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies to identify the Internet after absuchen radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they obscure insurgents, known as saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to pakistan, after he had been found, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the birthplace of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who have been briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, the Al Qaeda leaders Saifullah was not convinced that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged, and continue to dissect the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists, and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, has made it a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters as guardians of the organization, not letting those whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those who might be spies.
American al Qaeda will be tried by a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US ambitions and its propaganda value, but they are also regarded as extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years has also become much more cautious in regard to whom to allow access, because the US intelligence experts are their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone in these groups, what better way to go, as the recruitment model to follow that so many have followed?, Kohl said.
The model is based, is now much more on the internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action".
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella conference centre in the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the city.
On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with transparent through the city, which was in English, "there is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the birth of their mother, their awareness of what herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to take part in the mass demonstration - to the floor and to appeal to the world leaders, a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way to escape.
The police, the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either hooded or pocket knife with.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned.
A viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the negotiations on climate change, setting dressed in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main canal, near where several ministries.
They threw them in the vicinity of the buildings, he said, and added that it, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the conference centre, the people on television screens throughout the afternoon, the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive effect on the international considerations, he replied in english: "this is something that I was not even aware of."
He then drove in Mandarin and said: "Because the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He said that from the perspective of the individual is on whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that the negotiations or the freedom of other people upset."
The examination data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district of Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the evidence to show that the fourth and Achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, including National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and National level.
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington, D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), the African-American peer groups, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he was a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture of a six year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the item number, the children of both groups have grown in that time span, has reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district last week expressed their concern that the results of Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty was celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, are already strong children, have been taken.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of the D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D.C..
I will not for a span of two or three points, and down, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course, we would like to see the positive signs, which I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we are not near the time and energy that we would have to commit funds for our school.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum that Wilson reading system to use aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their classes comrades.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to class for the sixth games and lebensechte experience in the foreground, under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP progress, were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils benefit from the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to provide the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the Urban Audit.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms in the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions, working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we have a system schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the city neighborhoods, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is in washington, the traditional public school year, which at 180 days to extend, in order to compete with charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a larger increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than the prospect of
The coach, the Gettysburg College with a loud pipes.

Gracielas parents have no High School in El salvador.
Until recently, Graciela in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude, and those of other members of the group, the Gettysburg, where the teaching per year costs $was more of a ehrfurchtsvollen Besuchers than that of a future students.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said, as the low Professor to student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where. "
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States Hispanic immigrants, which does not end Highschool or as teenagers become pregnant, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of the college education that is needed in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans College -- which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents who are immigrants, mostly from Mexico or Central America, arrived in the United States, without the High school to have concluded.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which has a huge role in the labor force in the country will play the way forward.
Those who study high-achieving children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and a powered to success.
Many of them have parents who give their children and to find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But Beratungsprogramme also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to come in college, especially if these efforts over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, it will be a single measure at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia gándara, a researcher at the University of California at davis, the hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We have to think about it, for these children a support network of school by the High school.
The federal program, sponsored Gracielas College tour, is a useful example.
It is known as Gear up - a Gear - and is more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college preparation programs to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the High school.
According to the us Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% in college.

Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military held American oil companies from likely, analysts said to do more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
Us firms were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, which have been able to conclude contracts with the ministry.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.

We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern can be measured and fulfil its commitments to iraq.

They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was taken to a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents who are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the site and quickly took everything, what of the "completely destroyed".

The senior un envoy in Kabul will resign
The top UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, supported by the UN the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Eide redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 us troops to afghanistan.
The un envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the us timetable for the military withdrawal, which will start in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in the political transition in afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he will resign his office, but only one in March 2008, his family to agreement, only two years to remain in kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of the United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that they have time for a replacement.
What I said, is that it is better to find a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, in accordance with UN officials with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that it has accepted the schwedisch-italienisch-stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has been taken into account.
Eides position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the allegations, but he also said that the allegations of galbraith, was fired, "the mission undoubtedly harmed, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the American-led forces in afghanistan.
He also urged that the un leadership of his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The un rules are designed so that I since may, he said, only one person.
This is disastrous, and must not continue.
Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must comply with additional sanctions.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" imposed on Iran, because it is not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7 - day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from iraq, the war of its own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and disincentives" is needed, "in order to convince the Iranian government with nuclear weapons in reality is less protected," because "enormous" their people will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, European leaders joined in the warning that Iran is "credible" consequences if he continues with its nuclear program, does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and a substantial part of its stores stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed would forgo nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran, however, since that time, the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit to the United states.
Iran's suspension of the international community in relation to a number of proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, simply, has left, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way, as it brought in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran have never been, said Gates.
President Obama has 31 Dez. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian Mission to the United Nations, was it "baseless and unfounded allegations" some Security Council members on Thursday called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, the last Friday should return to Washington, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning, before it in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with representatives of the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the us plans to reduce the American troops by the end of august, from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought to use the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. US-Vertreter quoted Gates, Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will ensure their security, prosperity, and their autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China.
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them, the thought of that "mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "a baby means one more grave."
These lessons, they have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples encouraged more than to have a child, her response was immediate and definitive: "In any case".
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 - month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously Dicklichen, spoiled individual children who are affectionately called "little emperor", has led to a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department for population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 per cent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities, with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 year olds and elderly almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple nearby.
Xie lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, "in order to help to reduce the ratio of the ageing population and to alleviate the shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich as the developed countries, such as Japan and sweden," she said.
A gradual easing of tensions.
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy, arguably the most controversial injunction, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who oppose this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy, that the critical financial pressure on the country's natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples have had abortions carried out, leading to a high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for people have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007, the tone of many hard slogans curbed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, in which a partner Einzelkind.
Shanghai in july, the first Chinese city, has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who for a second child, and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, in order to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available, more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing response.
Although officials from a rural town in the external sector of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognize is that after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported against any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, still only four or five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165.000 -- will be slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and this is legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance, the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are assessing the one-child policy as the human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh month, is pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples for psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she would like to just one child, because it was also a einzelkind. "we were at the centre of the family and used that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and we are not really. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 - year old, which includes a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, is the birth rate is falling, he said, is to be successful and to be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see such a life not for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother with her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV to offer the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to say too many victims.
The group is drafting a plan to reduce emissions
By wild posturing and mutual accusations was emphasized by the un climate change - which until now has set on Friday with the publication of a document, which is a priority for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future, the greatest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special working group was silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term, so that they can deal with the global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrial and emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six pages of document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, in the centre, the leading climate protection representative of the UN, de Boer, known as "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, the countries of the emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The talks on friday, the European Community has a boost by their assurances over the next three years, $3.6 billion per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the champions of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fire stations, which the talks in the last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, less than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take action, stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion about an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he yafei, stating that the leading us climate negotiator either to "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week, that the United states, china, to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrialized nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States to fight for their commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers, who bear the costs for the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have moved more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, ulate, which is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central america.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning 24-seitigen submitted a draft Treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive on the small island states' political pressure on the whole political process, "partly because they are now United and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders must be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Prime entstiegen their aircraft and around through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to be ", during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people, daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows, where they make fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft treaty will be passed from hand to hand rather than by E Mail - is already a challenge.
The intensity builds just: Almost all of the important ministers are here on Wednesday, and 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Super League, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h faster train defines the Monday morning feeling newly
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe through the darkness, to announce the departure of a train, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country during his lightning trip from ashfort, kent, to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord adonis, the transport minister, will go to Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter services from london.
He hopes that the new service to Britain, to an international network of faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become viable commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car on the national carbon emissions and would reduce the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about environmental damage in the British hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still applying the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, linking London with the West midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site if the plan is the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also have three options for a wider, taller.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which a single network of high speed trains in the West midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a railway.
After the completion of the travel time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The draft would be offering the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, the British rail network would be the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the london, birmingham.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be dealt with.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will be known whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But even if he set the wheels in motion, to be built in sections of the rail network.
The trains had to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would be the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours.
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured, a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgages for 75,000 pounds on a Conservative Orangerie
Alan duncan, the leading Conservative member of the house of commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a Orangerie in which he himself in his house in his constituency build deported.

Last year, he has grown a winter garden in the plans as "Orangerie."
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."

"It basically says, if it works for the state that you live on meagre rations and treated like s * * * * * e."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and entitled to a tiny part of what is measured.
And I would be able to claim the whole sum, but I do not do it. "
The member, millionaire from his former career as Ölgroßhändler, was attacked because of his spending for the first time in may, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the Fees Office that it "could be regarded as excessive demand."
An activist, as a protest in Duncan lawn a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it became known that he talks about three years, 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) had demanded.
Last night, when he was asked about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was both the Fees Office, as well as following an increase in the value of Legg has been approved."
He added: "There is no debate about branching out and Durchschlängeln or bend the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and is strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clean. "

Late payment: angry prison guards, the actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials on Friday called for a general day of action in order to ensure that the bonuses and overtime, whose pay for budget reasons postponed until January, before the Christmas holidays.
The 2 Union of strafvollzugsbeamten ("fo-pénitentiaire"), called for the people who have no service on Tuesday morning before the strafvollzugsanstalt to demonstrate and to block them on the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The third union of Strafvollzugsbeamten ("CGT Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilisation in the various prisons to unite," on which the failure to pay in October on overtime, the Tzu proposals and Sundays and holiday increments in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable" gebranntmarkt.

The party Nouveau centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, according to the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to remind you that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007, the three-year membership of the party modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has adopted.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent, the absence of the deposit of the Akronyms UDF, in order to carry out this for themselves.
Continue to give you to bear in mind that this recklessness is poised to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, but in politics as in life would be better to make a name, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by fraudulently acquired a name on it has no legal claims."
Case Liliane Bettencourt, François Marie Banier will be sentenced for the exploitation of weakness
The Court in Nanterre, on Friday decided to cancel the artists François-Marie Banier, in order to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt, claims that a weak moment of Achtzigjährigen has exploited in order to make a portion of their assets.
The 62 -year-old photographer, who is known for his Star photographs, on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a crime punishable with a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
In fact, this decision means that it will be a process in this case, the saga is one of the richest families in France, where the mother and daughter scrap and at the same time the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire in the hand.
Equally, however, the 15 Court ordered a medical examination of the 87-jährigen Liliane bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre in conditions.
The doctors are appointed on Friday before the 10th March 2010 to present a report in which you clearly indicate whether and to what times Liliane Bettencourt in a state of weakness can be found.
I think they will undertake these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer, Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
The lawyer of Françoise bettencourt-meyers, Olivier metzner, he is with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) this old lady has manipulated, which must be protected, he said.
For the last two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt, a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused of him, the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to donations totalling one billion euros in the form of Bankschecks, insurance policies or Gemälden.
Liliane Bettencourt she had always been refuted by the photographers, to have been rigged, which it sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a big family debacle.
The lawyer of Liliane bettencourt to three of his Klientin to their lawyer were sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise bettencourt-meyers distrustful of.
According to her lawyer added Liliane bettencourt as follows: "could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, and twice daily to Banier wrote.
Since she married Françoise, I have never been able to talk again. "
The state prosecutor's office in Nanterre is, once again, the view that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship in recent days, the judge rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of the rule of law is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "the representative of the Public Prosecutor Marie - Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt Meyers has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its staff, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers from the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join the best "values", as it was on the Consumer products made by the technicians in the station.
By the customers in the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution of the strategies of the conquest of the markets have been in place... Although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of the customers to impose regularly again.
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R & eund, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; they claimed by the staff of a deployment, which contradict the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a workplace revolution, which would be the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very conditional use of internal polls,
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his wage workers, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear not.
- first, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many a circuitous route, after all this, primarily, to do... What it has always done.
Also because of the authoritarianism - one of the balance of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders of a very simplistic notion of human behaviour.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology of mechanistic.
You take the intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which was recently approved by the US "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, it suggests that it is possible to operate the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro.fr appeared poll by Ipsos executives confirmed in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilization of factors to identify and measure
Instead, one for the smooth functioning of the modern companies need occupational revolution for the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of steering a fundamental minutes: for the workers is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly as a means to a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Now only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set doxa assess their perceived picture of the company, which allows them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this mobilisation factors can predict the executives of the companies' social services' control and anticipate and human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
The speech of oslo: the "just war," Obama praise from the right one
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United states has defended.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars has inherited from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way of nine days ago to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good job".
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of obama's.
In some parts of this speech at all as historic, said in the radio programme "The Takeaway" was questioned.
The Member of Parliament by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased with a "President of the left" to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and not provide a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor of The Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to the fact that he is "cosmopolitan", as he always does, "he said," as an American President, "as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they themselves have created for their protection and do a lot, "Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos."
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the use of the armed forces.
The war packaged under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles times, which is still of the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to obama, described the speech itself for a speaker, who is known for his talent, as "monumental".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse," and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time.
Drivers: Three marathon for an agreement that ensures the supply at Christmas.
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the Straßenverbandes and TLF - the only employers' organisation, which remained to the end, on Friday evening to an agreement that the strike order and the threat of severe supply crunch puts an end to Christmas.
Friday evening in the signature "welcomed" the country responsible for the Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of divided the negotiating on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement at the end of the morning to sign quickly.
And despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11: 00 p.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only about 18: 00 p.m., the agreement was signed.
The conflict, "the company very much harm" and "it was feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 on 9.06 euros.
"It is not very much, but we are starting small," Clos (fo).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers.
"It will probably always be some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The chairman of the TLF Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult to give this wage increases in the face of international competition. "
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said on "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of the year 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective bargaining agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the charges for employers to the tune of EUR 100 million," the subject of an amendment to the government on the draft of the amended finances for 2009, which was on the night of Thursday to Friday, was adopted by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension of the labour Minister for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in a very short period of time," assured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euros "were the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose eaters in the approaching Christmas days to avoid disgruntling, laments the unostra.
For the Association of Otre threatens the agreement "to small and medium-sized companies in the sector in the next 12 months, a lot of digging."

As already on Thursday, there were no human racket on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the île de France on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of saint-germain-en-laye (Yvelines) was far less overflow than usual, particularly because of the lack of high school graduates.
In Boissy Saint Léger issued (val de marne), Jack nbakina, an engineer (29), he would be "one and a half hours earlier, in order to get to work on time."
The SNCF, the care of travellers by officials and security forces had planned, pointed out that in the Saint Lazare station to no bottlenecks.
The SNCF on the line RER A or in the direction of Cergy Le skin needs the trains came and went on the Saint Lazare station, at the end of the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday again general meetings of the strikers, while the results were reviewed by the associations after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon, classified as "pathetic".
The RER-business leaders proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line on all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they call for a long overdue pay award.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP, even their Lohnzuschlagsvorschläge in brackets, and stressed that the leadership "is in no position to solve a problem, but the drivers and the SNCF but has also made it possible."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting to "comprehensive review of conditions," was scheduled for Monday.
This shows the associations, too, that the company "the weekend drivers ignored."

Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro- Kurdish party on the Decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday was the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to make the 25 years of conflict to an end.
The "party for a democratic society" (dtp) was dissolved, because they had become a "haven for activities that are for the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç the decision would be taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes would have been required to impose the dissolution. moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the leadership of the party, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, for a period of five years have been excluded from the political scene.
Furthermore, the judges announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, and enjoy, and the confiscation of the property of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from $550).
The party leader said before the verdict that the Members of Parliament to meet parteilose parliamentarians.
The decision followed a in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdur Rahman Yalçinkaya operational procedures. He accused the dtp, the "command" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (pkk), which is viewed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP, the legal political showcase the PKK rebels.
The party, "no link" to the pkk, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the constitutional court transmits the government, which is seeking to accommodate the Kurdish community and a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, the support of the pkk, the Kurds are drying up and an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a dissolution of a outbreak of tensions in the southeast Anatolia could lead, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in recent weeks led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP millions in the city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and Wasserwerfer, as the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of thousands of people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict was to assume that the decision of the court "further deepen the despair".
"Turkey can resolve this (Kurdish, Mr editors) issue is not on the basis of the ban of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, regretted the decision.
"we oppose in principle against the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"this decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island.
"It is obviously a response by the PKK," he added.
On thursday, the PKK attack in which three days earlier killed seven soldiers in the north of the country. It was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The new Silicon Valley
For many years, it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded secret site for defence research.
Today, the town hall, with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts with the Frankfurt Science location - Riedberg linked with the university institutes and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt, signed a protocol for closer cooperation. "
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect, Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt wrote in Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the science Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel.
The exchange of scientific studies
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want Russian science companies jockeying for contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electrons technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The town hall was in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for the defence research has been established.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") got its name from the forested hills landscape in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart, an emergency brake
The dimension of the Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
Rightly so. it is much more than that of a station's, more than a construction project, which the City the provincial capital for a decade in shambles.
Stuttgart, 21, from the spirit of the 1980's.
With lines, right in the middle of the city, was seen at the time as a verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19th century, as a modern rail transport, as it was once a huge amount of time, locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen.
North korea, briefly, to go further - to go.
And that is why the head of stations: in Frankfurt and munich.
And in stuttgart: a passage, about half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s, no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that he and the Bavarian city is almost priceless, the low down.
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, however, since there are modern turning trains with driving vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local politicians have failed.
The railways, partly because of the risks of the largest infrastructure of the Republic of the individual taxpayers and not the state company.
The project is still reasonably justified.
New city area, which, according to the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system is harmful.
The transit station and the route expansion are intended for the movement of the 1980s - typically, brought huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first go to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is not because of tough climbs for freight trains.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade, the money to other hubs and Engstellen lacking in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 km stretch of the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, will be built on the route in slow motion.
Urgently needed, right here on the tube.
But as a brake.
The race will be for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the airport.
The provincial government has left open the Wiesbadener Landtag, whether they will go against the judgment of the hessischen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights in revision.

It is hellishly difficult, if We must keep its word, said green chief Tareq Al Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep his word".
The minister refuted the accusation by the provincial government attempts to come to terms with "and" but their night flights.
A precise legal review of their time.
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition, are the statements of his group have never been on night flights.

The troubled us big banks of their government shackles.

A snap election
It was then faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Governing Board, the acting editor Nicholas Brender had pushed out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
As a favourite was Peter Frey, the head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios in Berlin.
A confirmation from the station to ensure there was no official, however, not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it will also have played a role, the zdf-intendanten Markus Schächter should not further damage, this proposal to the board of directors will not be retained.
Frey, a candidate needs the support of nine of the 14.
The result of the vote was not in print of this edition.
Two weeks ago, was Schächter with his proposal to extend the contract with Nicholas Brender for a further five years, the board failed.
Only seven members of languages for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for Schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the European majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not wanting to confirm in office.
Organised by the opposition against the editor-in-chief of the Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF lost in ratings, has refused to accept a further term of the highly-regarded chefredakteurs.
Until just before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
At least 35 Staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate, the approach to admit chefs as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it. "
The person.
Peter Frey, on 4 August, was born in 1957 in Bing.
He studied politics, education, and Romanistik.
After that, he worked in the South West and the Frankfurter rundschau.
In 1983 moved on ZDF Frey, first of all, the "today" Journal.
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist; 1991 / 92 correspondent in washington; by 1998 head and moderator of "morning magazine"; by 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF capital studios.
The Greens Brenders, following the dismissal of the announced on Wednesday by the industry newspaper medium magazine, was elected to the journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
The board of directors, the Prime Minister, Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change so that Personalvorschläge of Intendanten not by a politically motivated majority be blocked.
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of the zdf, however.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - the body immediately after the dismissal angrily criticised for doing so.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without getting into the suspicion, a partisan office.
In the will, in any case, the liberal left-wing Frey.
The study will be entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Ministers of the countries on Thursday finally: At a meeting of Ministers of Education and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to study conditions at the Bachelor and Master of wanting to improve.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
In particular, they agreed to in principle, to reduce the burden: each study module is only with a single test.

Fewer tests.
Since the beginning of the student protests in june uni-rektoren Culture Ministers and ensure the saying of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council, decided to drastically reduce the number of tests in part: "Each module, usually with only a test," it says in a 30-page paper, the approval of some new courses.
With the "significant reduction of the audit of proof," said the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted."
In addition, the "Studierbarkeit" in the future, "the decisive factor" in the design.
Modules as content are "strictly to examine" whether "unnecessary restriction of students in the choice of
Events "that would be avoided.
The students' right to maintain margins, and promote the initiative ".
The rules should apply in the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "-- which means that it lasts until 2015, until all the courses were reviewed.
This is a federal responsibility for ten accreditation agencies, which was set up by the countries under the accreditation Council.
The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October "with vigour" to the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and the testing regime is not too strict.
In individual countries, universities and colleges with the Landesministerien already agreed to take appropriate measures.
So far as the only country in the Rhineland-Palatinate said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The money from the universities, above all, Tutorenprogramme set up and studies advice and audit and Auslandsämter.
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment of the higher education law to parliament.
This will be necessary for the conclusion of a study model, only one test.
The study design should be more flexible, and will facilitate the recognition of performance to prove to other universities and access to the master.
By the end of next year, all courses of the country on their studierbarkeit be reviewed.
The government and the opposition had on Thursday again on the studies conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of the Juso high school groups, the design of the education policy should no longer "behind closed doors," the Minister and university chancellors.
After the Bildungsstreiks should now also the students and interested parties "have a say."
The future graduates received support from the President of the university Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The trade union education and science (gew), the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal right to each graduates with a bachelor-abschluss access to a secondary Masters course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor-studierenden tomorrow with the best possible conditions masterstudienplätze enough studies available, so gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar.
The countries need to hire more teachers.
A freer access to master the Culture minister, however, were not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller.
In Germany, and the deal is good almost no control... "is the first line of a Gedichts of Lyrikers Werner SoLlner, spoke in the troubling issue snatches the arrival experience of dissidents, won the freedom, but at the same time has lost its language.
The 1951 in Romania's Banat Werner Söllner first born as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as a Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he worked in 1982 to Frankfurt am Main übersiedelte.
Söllner is decorated with various prize in 1993, he was the legendary Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen Literaturforums in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major außerliterarisches last Tuesday during a meeting in munich, in the "german literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files."
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Helmuth frauendorfer, his cooperation as im for the Romanian securitate.
Together with some of those present had Söllner in 1989, the German language Prize.
The recruitment attempts had begun, first in 1971.
I am, therefore, "someone who is against the attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist, Werner Söllner is in the process of Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize homage to Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule is the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors originating from Romania shaken by a case of the spectators and the Dutch recognizable costume of a political system, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as we can tell after bisherigem knowledge, not just the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate acts have played a role in Walter, said after the confession Söllners literary scholar Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it in for him at the time, "sensitive points," Markel.
It is a moral need to make that point.
Söllners statement was in the form and in the audience unexpectedly, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian intelligence, however.
Germany was a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in july at the time, having their own acts, 914 pages, had read.
The people concerned, it must be remembered that will be spent on housing and in some case may also have known what Klarname behind the Decknamen Sorin, and Walter.
Unlike the country is now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered.
The Birthler agency, National Council for reappraisal of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, until the publication of the files, but since then has been more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the management of the files.
That is the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief Temesvar dismissive about the Prize.
They have a climate of fear, they have only once interrogated.
The scandal of power, said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case Söllner tie, as so often in connection with the need to blame the inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of The Zuhörenden Söllners commitment gives hope that The continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
The recovery of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation of another Champions League.
It was as if there is a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party, which had distributed a sporting goods manufacturers Goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class.
The man with the markanten Glatze was because of him in a foreign city.
Otherwise, he would also have been able to drive himself %-% alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen above the 55 - year - old girl was neither.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work.
Or just right away.
In the words of the first three days earlier Schweizers pledged: "we have reached the eighth finals', namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3 - 1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania," but we must not be blinded by the success: it is a brutally tough fight against the descent. "
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then it is in Mainz, the royal class performance in the League of everyday life.
And once again revealed weaknesses in the aftermath of the rapid three gates by Marica (5), (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots.
The eighth finals of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be chosen by lots as scrutineers in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of winning the commencement of the successor to behave.
Not only with the supposed saviours, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short term self-confidence, dedication and love of the game.
I am on the players and told them that they should consider their strengths, and have encouraged them to be brave souls plumber Gross, said the simple recipe for success, which had been under Therapeut Babbel but no effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel Jens lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, we would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after a verletzungspause thanks to his dynamism go straight to the best players on the place in the attempted "phenomenon" with the proverbial "wind of change" and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns of sport Horst Heldt Board
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, the continuity.
As Gross herding players and managers, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely swamped and deal with the Romanian guests.
They have also won in glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 will wake up to bear in mind.
And sports bureau, Horst Heldt reminded that, although a season goal has been achieved, but it is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.
The fact that Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not feeling, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a just before the beginning of the game in the TV interview broadcast by Torhüter Jens Lehmann fresh auflebten.
There are decisions that affect the other, and not the Jens, Heldt Lehmanns countered the harsh criticism.
The board of had been accused of weakness and have decided to change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans.
The fact that his free day after Games had been withdrawn, Lehmann took as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "pure egotism," keilte Heldt, vowing serious consequences for the final man.
They will have no friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all the others agree that without the preparatory work by the team of coach who replaced the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison, and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup in the heavyweight Fight
A heated duel in Bern: Continually provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of the Ukrainians Schwergewichts defended his title after version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains Box in the heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 119, 120, 108, 109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainians was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it has with the knockout punch, the expected all have not worked.
Klitschko built his record of 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to surrender on the basis of injuries.
Johnson's challengers had to fight the first defeat in 24.
Around 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena wanted to dictate the 2.02 metres tall Klitschko the fight, especially with his left hand.
The 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, of the duel had announced the end of the Klitschko-era, but always eluded the blows of the world, so that Klitschko its dangerous rights could not get into the crucial goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and sought only through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, met his blows to the world champion but only rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had in the fight in the Swiss capital for some.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly" zombie "is not right".
The mother-to-be was the champion then on Friday to provoke, Johnson the sun glasses of the nose, "in order to be able to see his eyes."
The fourth after the Klitschkos comeback victory.
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback win on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years time, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "his" recovered WBC belt, which he had previously made without a fight.
This year, he defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in September and Chris Arreola from the United States.
I have only a stroke in this fight, and I am physically very well in the form, Klitschko the rapid return to the ring.
His dream, but the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is WBO and IBF world champion of the associations.
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye, after this in November the 2.13 meter Nikolai walujew.
Haye had earlier in the summer, cancelled a planned for September fight against Vitaly klitschko.
Supposedly, whose promotion company is now planning the fight against Klitschko in London Wembley stadium.
Kunduz case.
Frontal attack from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information on the kunduz-affäre described as a liar.
The spd and Left sought clarification of the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - after the recent findings of the air strikes of Kunduz, the opposition Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol lorries in September said "knowingly selling,", said Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD television news programme ".
It is called the popular: he lied.
The order to kill was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO, Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just a destruction of the abducted vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
Us air strikes were requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, according to investigation report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
The SPD, Greens and Left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the Chancellery, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague, Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not have specific operations of the Armed Forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tanklaster-anschlags.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and the Minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the ministry of defense even referred to several reports, including a two-way document of the befehlhabenden Colonel small and a feldjägerbericht.
Wichert is now in a letter asking for clarification of the facts, "the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sunday newspaper reported."
He had not received a reply, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday to the allegations and pointed out that this will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the bundestag, who formed next wednesday.
Dream worlds.
Some people see in wachem state pictures and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it is in his sleep, everything is in order.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should be in the wildest ideas and phantasiegebilden.
However, those who experienced in the wake up his dream job conditions, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicted, at least as Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that will enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
Traumartig modified growing awareness conditions can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the vision of the Mystikerin Hildegard of bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of the new-age-propheten Carlos castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but due to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - and dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin theme is disrupted and the interaction of various parts of the brain.
Complex hallucinations and delusions thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and scientists since antiquity.
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861, a "great similarity of misleading one with dream" for Sigmund Freud was the dream "a climate of fear, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. turned in a comic figure.
His body is a multi - dimensional and quietschbunt.
The force of gravity has no power over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him a vicious figures with blutroten, distorted fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They were hunting him, him with serious inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices from walls and radio.
He can no longer, the process.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet to a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and observed the noose around the neck.
The maid.
The noose is withering.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in the chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning t. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, he is a maniac low, he takes medication, against the depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness for three years, he is married.
In the climate of fear, I have seen the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one per cent of the population affected at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia in psychiatric hospitals, it is treated as the second most common cancer after the Depression.
In an acute psychosis schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they get trapped in a state of übererregten hallucinations, scale, relationships or paranoia can lead.
This is particularly widespread stimmenhören voices, comment on the orders, or dialogisieren.
Also, optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person can no longer important to separate from what is trivial, the brain can no longer filter disorderly signals from the awareness is concerned.
As the dream also opens the psychosis, the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The number is located in the centre of the event, everything has to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, like the dream of the events overwhelmed and cannot actively shape.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality is not possible, the medical images are cruel reality, it ends.
Once in a lifetime to have seen an incredible nation.
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Exactly why our brains antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional circumstances can lead in every person that he loses in the short term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale the brain at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fox explained.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, the first over many years.
Environmental factors play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the line is there.
Halluzinogene drugs can also cause psychosis, as they are in the central system.
If our brain is overheating.
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money for drugs, in order to get, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich castes.
Whether related images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a question of the position.
It collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and related phenomena, last year, he has his results in The book "The unreal world in our head" evaluated.
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and skull or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, consists of content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise when Hirnareale where Sinneswahrnehmungen are processed, or too little, and regulations; if our brains are hot, or even if stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state, as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also, stress, or other mental Ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in a lifetime, to have seen a halluzination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl.
If not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
If he replies, the fellow students look surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They do not believe the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. is not, it knows it.
She is awake, they see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank to see or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for the moment.
A pleasant feeling is that they may hold the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But they know that this boy and the other fantasy images are real, and then disappear again.
At night, are the most frightening phenomena,
Often, the images are also a burden.
If they are sitting in the class room, it can not follow the teaching material sometimes, because the teachers in their eyes and ears for a new fellow pupils, while he presents for all other visual and visible in the bar of mathematical equations.
At night, the most frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake, or whether the pictures, which sees them, the Fratzen or the girl of arms and legs, with the bleeding before their eyes open or closed.
Let me in peace, the characters.
Parents and friends told them that they would be crazy.
In the autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year, she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists caste, she knows full well that it is not crazy.
It is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or under appeal withdrawal, he has, in all probability, after a time, hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is concerned, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a einzelkind, had a little girl fear of other children, often, she played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they called Papa, since they can think of their biological father.
As visual and audio hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah k. difficult to distinguish related images and reality. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also late - night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to the schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unlikely to see.
It advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between the dream and hallucinations.
In our world is very bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience, unfortunately, mostly pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative, cow is also a work of art from despair.
Degenhard Schmidt has researched the so-called oneiroide experience in the form of a particular form of the dream of unique changed security awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-träume, the Erlebende for real and it does not subsequently cannot distinguish between the security situation.
The oneiroide mentality is in a state of trauma or illness caused by extreme situations, for example, Polyradikulitis patients in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
Total impotence, for example, if a person is threatened by loss of self- and world, he replaced the real situation, through its own imaginary world, the reality is, says Schmidt rapier hard.
A kind of border state of the dream and hallucinations.
Since the completion of a situation in the reality is not possible, a change in the world, but the real situation in the Imagination.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and meaning, in an intolerable situation, which allows people to design their own ability, not in a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, later in the memory of
The zürcher art historian Peter cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "change of heart" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body in the intensive care unit to Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen, a world in a selbstgeschaffene visited foreign times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs from blood.
Kidnapped by a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in the Firnschnee in the Alps and hits a Korean mafioso.
He is completely in the imaginierten, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel to distinguish itself from any dream.
The dream is a different situation, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys and even after years in the minor details.
More and more even than really experienced it.
The intensity of this goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience, says the psychiatrist.
At the end of the show, psychoses, hallucinations and Drogenrausch how fragile our internal and the external reality in the eye.
Any change of status, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience may also be rewarding.
The snow can fall
Burda
Children should play the cottage with 27 years.
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda company wants to be in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The holding company will also in future to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda, his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children die with 27 years and have the determination to enter into the company, said the 69 years of the mirror.
The details we have taken the precaution.
The question of whether they are active in the company, then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot 7 500 staff his children, if they are not enough.
This brings the children, and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from the board chair from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
The 52-year Kallen is a member of the board of directors since 1999, Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury to take responsibility for the Unternehmensvermögen and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, this is not a family member at the top of the verlages.
Children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also, "10 to 15 years," burda.
The holding should continue to 100 per cent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases and Schickedanz Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not above the sinking are safe: "It was always families who were infected by a capital addiction, which is completely verspekuliert and thought they could rise as the great player.
My strategy was never the case.
He had "never had dreams of world power," Burda.
I am not as the political präzeptor of this country, as it was springer, and I do not want to in the world league with 'time', these shops are too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can only be read his e-mails, without a possibility, to be able to see certain annexes or surfing the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is on the streets to see is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smart Phones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half the price of a flat rate of an iphone.
After the company has seen the success that it has two new products on the market: One that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong Gratisservice for data, unlike the Peek, with a six times higher price to pay.
Fonpeek Le Web was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, has, however, as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who, with a Smartphone travel around the world, already know what it means to give up all the data in order to be able to read his emails, as soon as they cross the border, or if you are desperate for a café with WIFI addiction (or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with fon).
The idea of roaming with a flat rate is incredibly tempting and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone operators already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read about all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe, almost always ignored.
But half of their own country has always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
That a small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of fon, although it has no Wifi / wlan) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly but surely rethink and start to a number of options to consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in his prices is the illegal downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what I expect of FonPeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong access to the Internet as the Peek already in the United States.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The impact of a colour of Michelle
Gelb is, without a doubt, the American First lady.
The inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken on both occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and for the same substance, and that it was something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as the first sight, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States on the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes in the way, from which they are made.
At the inauguration, wore a dress from head and one from gemusterten table in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time Green shoes with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair was different: the hair were put on this occasion as hair wreath, with the previous bore the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work.
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women to study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study, frankly, that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of work.
Those of you who auβerhalb of the house, no other work only part-time work or a fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a permanent jobs, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the drawing, a figure that has to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this and together and the first child until much later.
It also has the kind of work in a big influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the use of readiness, "says the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child is even higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group, aged between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main school or a higher education have, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 mother for the first time.
There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school completion exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and have their first child, delgado.

Cowardly aggression.
My 70 - year-old mother was last week by our district of the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly, a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 years in addition to her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling we from the closet, and just six kilograms, and then out of the blue he missed two and injured him so difficult.
It is not our outrage in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, where since the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and defenseless animals should be, of course, was carried out on the leash.
The attack, a woman who cosy top-ranking, these people as a result of the incident, they wanted to chastise; indeed, they feared for their own lives, because if a Wahnsinniger attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps also with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet town at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary tuesday.
The dog all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nahgelegenen police service, however, we have grave doubts as to whether it will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were spaniards.
Our outrage at what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what is in the minds of these young people that they have to be a cheap attack on a helpless animal to find fun on an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the benefit of the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for traffic safety (fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists launched, as both companies announced today.
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection, the head injury or even death can prevent in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that the campaign is part of its commitment to safety, "the far more covers than just the design and manufacture of products that are safer with every day" and reaffirmed that they will continue with other actions educational and informative character contribute to this goal every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan 'to be or not to be', in a first phase posters of over 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the bestmöglichste spread.
In conclusion, michelin, stressed that the road safety "is a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they are as manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles always see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of Kleinlastwagen is rising again.
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks are finally beginning to see light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months will decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with caution, because the comparison data become available in November 2008, which is a particularly bad with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must bear in mind that, apart from the rise in the last month, the Gesamtzulassungen 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since january, total 95.853 vehicles sold in this figure, but all vehicles, which is the kleintransportermarkt: descendants of passenger cars, vans, pick-ups, small vans and light vans / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
So we need to these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten cries of credit institutions, other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate, or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little help.
This plan is, however, not only for individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right, but when it comes to changing up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, had Ganvam reminded us that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small trucks and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealers association predicted for the year 2010 a year, as the last, for which it with a loss of sales (in passenger cars and suvs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was the case with the ABS and how it is now with the ESP stability control, must be on the brakes in emergency situations in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles, a transition period until the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union has aimed to improve the protection of pedestrians, but they can brake systems because of their operation also help to prevent a number of road accidents.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers, which recognises the system on the basis of the drivers Bremsstärke carried out on the brake pedal.
However, this pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned inquiry, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the toss, not more, on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 branch accidents.
The contrast with maximum force in the braking system and reduces the Bremszeit and thus also the Bremsabstand slapped in the face by a car.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even fewer accidents, it is estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented with injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems to be popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then reacted to help him in the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be needed.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the toss is unavoidable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, so that the damage as much as possible.
General Motors puts the plan for Opel until January.
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (zaragoza) by Nick reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (gm) europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first week of april, probably on 8, according to Mr ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick reilly, the new chairman of GM europe, namely to ensure that the affected side their consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, to postpone until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen GM said that it will in the next few days, a decision on the sale of saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer, so that a decision as soon as possible.
Gm, with a number of potential new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports, has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is becoming more and more popular.
If none of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel was used by the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kilograms.
To create something refrained from first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms, thanks to the aluminium used in this model, as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again in 13; it has also reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that were saved another 7 kilograms; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet seats again in 12 and with the slight 19 customs wheels back five.
It was even through the renunciation of the Audio system CDR 30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe episodes from substance by the lack of a kilo.
Although he was also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride in a car with 6 - normal hand wheels carried out mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes, the very kurvig.
In this way, we can only give him the complete.
The reduction of its weight, but that does not mean he is now no longer so sure on the pitch.
It is, in fact, the opposite is the case: for long, we no longer have such a small and easy test, which is a model but also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete,, his muscles in a low gear in the time required to warm to him until we give the orders to slow down, of course, to recover and then all over again from his engine to get out...
He is doing what he says The car makes everything we do it with our hands on The steering wheel indicate, thanks to its management, as well as precise as kommunikativ.
And he did it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes.
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster s) is very good and we can still make him with the 'sport' option, as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already in the Panamera for the first time.
The missile is brutally, whether from the stand out or renewed.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads, on which we are with the Boxster spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants on the whole route almost nothing at all to do; and that, although we found some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt in the morning.
In summary, we can say that it is a ultraleichtes car, a car, which has a Fahrspass otherwise, as it is rare, and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster ss.
The car in February 2010 will come on the market and 70.831 euros.

The Baskonia paying themselves a victory in Israel.
The Caja laboral story, despite the many popular players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, a magnificent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex fuβballfeld of Maccabi Electra and thus ends up in the first place in its Group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple the best of his team was in the assessment (29).
The team from vitoria, the significant loss of Mr mann, oleson, Huertas or Micov replaced by a great sense of commitment and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end to its victory.
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten right from the start at the top of the table displays.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Perimeter came out, it was already that it holds on to the pitch with good reheated wrist.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava opted for a innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, which is home to extend their advantage further before the break (34 - 43).
Teletovic began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points, including the "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of the brazilian.
Despite the was the game despite the clear advantage in the recess is far from decided and the Makkabäer wanted to the Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone on the pitch, and thanks to the "hand of elías" they came into the game.
And Pnini contributed to ensuring that the "yellow" at the helm umdrehten (50 - 49).
Even more disadvantages.
The team of ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get back in the air and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas that ads on the table again einberuhigender refrain from (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make.
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75), have already announced that they would not allow them the victory, which they honestly deserved in the first 30 minutes, taking back.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried to give their team by three points from the line (70 - 77).
Nevertheless, and although cluster because Fouls off-side was not on the team of Mr defended well, and although the Israelis nor in the last minute on a repeat (85), the game was already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja
Unicaja lost vociferously against Olympiacos in Greece and had the lead in group B of the Euro League to cede to him, and that, in a game that by defaults on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game was marked, what the Greeks facilitated the victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter of the Andalusian start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts with 12 - 18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos, of the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a home match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22 / 20 in their favour, indicate the minute, following a campaign in which it almost to the brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and so would have both been disqualified.
The Greek team began at last to be warm and his superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Free country because of injury and the three clear traces the Unicaja hinterlieβen self - inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez.
Among their players in the domestic sphere, and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with his triple, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 to 32.
A race was impossible.
The third game quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, despite his 19 losses showed superior and even managed to offset the difference in Malaga armed game with 66 - 48 in the 27th minute, which in turn the leadership within the group to waver.
Unicaja tried to focus on the many defaults and the departure of the during the game injured Scots Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three of Cook and the use of Lewis back some hope to 66-57.

After the verlockendsten days since last spring, in which the inflation of the assets of the prevailing mood in the markets was the uncertainty in the markets returned in any case, which is surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets, it was with the direct purchase of assets to pay off the debt and indirectly the liquidity free rein in interest rates, the move to zero, so that the banks' assets to the Abrechnen.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses will rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts they achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United states, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the countries in the euro zone in Germany.
Spain has until now barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
A degree of uncertainty on the other hand, to the defenders of the moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects, to which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have adopted a new day thanks to action.

It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the fulfilment of its external payments and therefore a euro member country no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of außergewöhnlicchen measures in order to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are as expected an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some Ausschweifungen to large sums of money, it would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of public debt at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn would further increase, it is a special Spanish risk.

After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural fenosa, Rafael Villaseca Galán, gave the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion by 2030 from that date to invest under the conditions that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, however, is of the opinion that we should invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the issue and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it is estimated that 18,000 MW more are needed, under the vorraussetzungnatürlich by other "stützenergien."
Galán, is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what his company, wanted to say something about this law, such as incentives for the national kohleverbrauch, which is the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.

Acciona competing with very deep and Bouygues at his first construction of motorways in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already as energy and water companies.
The building, which it is a tunnel, the 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros) will cost.
The French company Bouygues and the German universities are in the process of its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona, in the country as a construction company and motorway operators.
The city government would have completed the construction by the end of 2014.
After the administration for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided for the project after a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and mautstellenverwaltung.
In anticipation of the proposals presented in may, the estimated investment to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion), and in the last phase three consortia, particularly European construction companies to compete with each other.
The group with the City will be led by acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction company australia, while the second, based in italy, is one of the best specialists in production.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is in a close election, called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn to ACS), which also includes local Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction work and privatisations, however, there is a hurdle to overcome it, because it is only through the purchase of a local construction company entry.
A strategy of the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian record, followed by the Spanish Baugiganten still needs to be pursued.
Even ACS has responded to this market only through his participation by 30% of Hochtief, the owner of the so-called Leighton, gained entry.
Million in assets.
Acciona on this geographical area of the utmost importance for the industry, in which it already because of his work as an energy supplier and the desalination industry is very well known.
