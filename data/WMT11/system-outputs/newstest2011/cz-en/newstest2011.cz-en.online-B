What do you do? CSSD Prague knows Voldemort or candy bar
New Councillor of the CSSD will have seemed to overcome some language barriers to the Prague Council and council understand its old-new colleagues from the ODS.
Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council of Social Democrats "tried" to know the well-established slang that originated in the town hall during the last years, the Prague ruled the current coalition partners.
Coded dictionary Prague political elite introduced during the previous era mayor Pavel Bem, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and case in his city.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new council does not understand too well-known concepts.
At least it says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really do not know."
"I'm in Prague politics rather novice," responded to the test "kmotrovského 'vocabulary for culture Councillor Luke Kaucky.
And though as a political veteran, responded similarly Councillor Karel Brezina.
Perhaps the term "golf hole.
"It's one of those words, what you present to me, which I use occasionally."
"Otherwise, generally do not recognize the slang."
The glossary, the terms Aktuálně.cz published in June this year before the election Congress ODS editors selected six examples, mainly those who are well connected with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists have to explain the concepts of "Voldemort," the "greatest golf hole in Prague," "go to the patisserie," "buffalo hump," "betrayal of the City" and "oplechovat.
Trinity Councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Anthony Weinert, who is heading the Prague in the future of education - first interview he promised, but later he took the phone.
Councillor Peter Dolínek fifth straight Test refused.
"These things do not resolve at all and how to enjoy the Civic Democrats, I will evaluate."
"I now addresses how we will understand in the context of our programs," said.
As already mentioned, Councillor Luke Kaucky would reportedly not recognize the title of the speech of an influential entrepreneur and friend exprimátora Bem Roman Janousek.
"Voldemort" Kauckému he says nothing and the only term that the test correctly guessed, is "the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"It's Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, and immediately adds: "But I know more of the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," quips.
Golf hole, then a tunnel Blanka administration decrypts only matador Karel Brezina, but also for the environment Councillor Luke shy.
Both the Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort, shy, and Luke is familiar and where to find this character - ink phrase meaning "to go to the patisserie.
"That means I go into some of Prague's business," the sail close to breaking the terms of office Janouškových companies.
Consistent with Brezina notes that the knowledge gained during his newspaper rather than to use such a dictionary.
The Social Democrats under any similar test trainees zaběhnutý glossary of slang terms exist.
"I also advise my colleagues, but it looks like they really do not have anything like that."
"We tell you more names, sometimes garbled symbols and text used abbreviations and names," said chairman Peter Hulínský CSSD Prague, party members who dubbed Hulda.
"At school I said Birch, but I do not know if they call me and colleagues," he admits to his own nickname, Karel Brezina.
Aktuálně.cz name tried and it works.
Councilman Weinert for party members or less friendly Grandpa Old Man representative Miroslav Poche, has attracted attention before the election fraud in the sponsorship side, some colleagues have nicknamed "Igráček.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in the intra-speech permitted.
Hulínský said Hulda like to hear, but Aktuálně.cz seen as a new nickname that President Prague.
"Dr. obuškového rights" supposedly recalls that Peter got his Hulínský JUDr. Police Academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit torture "witches," a brochure released
Women in Burkina Faso declared as witches usually have several common characteristics.
It belongs rather to the older generation, not to engage in such work for health reasons, are unmarried and have no children.
The one who is a witch "becomes" is sent into isolation in order to not jeopardize the rest of the village.
"Can this fate befall only very rarely."
"Marginalize even healthy young women, because they help to work and bear children," says the nun, who is in the capital of Burkina Faso, West Africa in a special care home for more than a hundred women of their community's expulsion from its ranks.
Local government is now unusual to "social measures" decided to act.
She has published information booklet, which should help limit the witch-hunt.
But Case has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can not read," pointed out the disadvantage of writing education daily Die Standard.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders with Burkina Faso, died last week dvaasedmdesátiletá Amma Hemmahová after her three women and two men were tortured, doused with kerosene and set on fire.
The case reported BBC.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
The woman, according to their version of ignited oil that is used for ritual anointing.
Apparently burst into flames after a group of women wanted to "expel the evil spirit."
Isolation "witches" that support people regardless of education level.
Daily Der Standard quoted dvaačtyřicetiletého businessmen from Burkina Faso: "devourer of human souls always pose a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso is a witch hunt trying to moderate government in the Gambia have not participated in last year by the President.
"Gambian President Jámí after the death of his aunt, unleashed a large-scale witch-hunt, which allegedly involved in her death and try to use black magic to kill the president."
"To help you invited shamans from nearby Guinea, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and private security guards forced the president did a randomly selected men and women from villages GAMBIA the president's ranch in Kanilai," said in its report, Amnesty International.

Bakalův tenant: drowning in the stove, higher rent sign
Older heavyset man walked out the door client center RPG Flats 'coal baron' Zdenek Bakala, the largest privately owned rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a new folder and its lease for three dwellings: his, her daughters and her son, who is in prison.
All three picked up just rent deregulation.
Instead, the son of 3500 a month from next year to pay for the 2 +1 second category of 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating must petrama (solid fuel stove, note. Ed.) " Shows a man his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature is on full power.
"But I signed it," said half angry, half resignedly.
BytyOKD.cz Civic Association, which the new tenancy conditions identified as "unfair and immoral," advises tenants not to sign a new contract and wait until 7 December, when published guidance on how to counter them.
But about a man waving a hand.
"One says this, another that," frowns.
Ostrava has become a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year expect the vast majority of dwellings are in the Czech Republic is still non-market rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the laboratory individually.
Havířov waiting RPG is one of the four on Tuesday in the Ostrava region and nine in the morning is already full.
Right next door is a security guard from the security agency and its starting unit.
"Rent 2011," shines a special button on the touch screen.
One tap and the machine starts with a paper document.
Or do not manage to read "157" and you figure it beeps on the large screen below the ceiling of the waiting room.
For half a second you turn.
The hire comes after a few moments to ask an older couple in the waiting room with a rush of new leases, but apparently not at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - request for repairs, insurance and similar events.
Letters to get new leases in the Ostrava and mailboxes of most of the tenants of 44 thousand dwellings RPG portfolio from about mid-November.
RPG Flats them letters proposing to increase rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special partition on the new rents were in the client center opened on 18th November.
"It runs through the week, so it's only run-in," workers at the desk after some hesitation, when the client presents as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former mining Bakala flats are local combustible topic.
Before the elections, it took quite loudly Parliament Vice-President and a native of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats, and even now it is full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years after I got this new floor."
"Not Pos .. Ana plate on my toilet not exchanged," relieves the man mentioned in the introduction.
Most workers come under yet retired, to see if I get a discount on rent if you sign on time, as their role-playing in a special menu promises.
Half off the February rent, get the other tenants who will sign a new contract by 15 December.
Havířov "deregulatory" bulkhead questions but certainly not overwhelmed.
"From yesterday's 360 clients for rent in 2011 was only about forty to fifty people," estimate worker behind the counter.
RPG while on their bulletin boards and Web site proposed the negotiation of individual contracts where needed.
However, if the lease both parties agree, he will have to establish an independent tribunal.
"This is not a threat, but the information the only possible legitimate and completely legal procedures," says RPG on its website.
"There will be no one to judge," said one of the RPG Flats workers and the man on the street outside the center to give the client partly right.
"I have 13,000 pension and left me five thousand at the meal, I do it for me to judge," he said.
Workers but then still doubt himself.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek them in the media says, do not sign either, so some people are waiting," considering.
The regulation of rents in the end most of the Czech Republic with New 2011 and under RPG Flats increase their economic necessity.
"The current rent is still less than the amount needed for simple maintenance of housing stock," commented Pavel Klimes, director of portfolio of residential apartments RPG that just angry tenants complained of neglect of the housing stock, according to homeowners' main reason for the increase rents.
While the five years between 2005 and 2010 from RPG to invest in rental housing four billion, four years from 2011 to 2014 to be 5.2 billion.
Large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded sedačkám Havířov waiting while repeating some information highlighted in red.
"The increase in rents in 2011 by 15% and less concerned with 31,200 flats, it is more than 90% of dwellings RPG."
"And it will always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter a month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 bytes of RPG lease portfolio rises by 38 percent.
"In these cases there is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," said RPG.
In 2600 apartments will rent the same next year.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation of rents not cast a leap, but it will be spread over four to eight years.
Adds another commitment: All the money from the increase in rent (see chart) gives the company back to the flats, especially in heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority is given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.

House of bones fascinate even after 100 years. Look to the interior of Gaudi
The roof looks like a prehistoric lizard ridge, the backbone of a dinosaur reminds stairs and balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona, ​​the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From a local house for its organic shapes Dubbed the house of bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaic facade reminiscent of scales and soft curves everywhere, all of which are typical of Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudí.
The facade of the house opens a dreamy lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
The detailed study shows geometričnost, rhythm, and just thought of procedure.
At night, the entire facade of the house ends up even more dramatically, it is lit so that the impression is further enhanced gloss paint.
Winding and twisting shapes appeared equally as well as indoors.
Wood follows the waves in the window frames, handrails, door trim, moldings and watch.
Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on a busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia 43, the house was rebuilt in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took place two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of old buildings and the construction of entirely new, but soon adopted the idea of ​​an unusual Gaudi and cheaper redevelopment.
Apartment building Casa Batlló, but he suggested it to Antoni Gaudí.
Collaborated with him an architect, Josep Maria Jujol.
It is on a developer's board created decorations for the apartment property owner's representative and the use of mosaics on the facade.
The facade has worked a number of other authors and artists.
Joint work on proposals for building Casa Batlló started a successful cooperation with Jujol Gaudio.
Jujol took part in building the Gaudi building Casa Mila and Park Guell, which is another Gaudi work.
From a local house soon after earned her organic shapes with the nickname "House of the bones."
Others have him for a specific mechanism for opening the windows began to call "zívajícím house.
It is also said that on top of the building's representations sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden motives include religious and other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudi designed the house for its time, a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and chimneys typical.
May seem bizarre to the forty-five degree slope.
When creating Gaudí then totally disregarded building regulations and not leave them tied up.
At the start of construction while the city received a building permit, but it provided details about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years after the completion of the City Council was alarmed by the result and asked for redress.
Councillor mind, for example, that the building will interfere with the pillars of the public sidewalk.
The correction never happened vice versa: only fifteen days after the request of the city, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to lease the top two floors of the building.
The owner himself had moved to lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor of a banquet hall and on the third floor bedroom and a private section of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased jewelry.
The entire six-storied building intersects the staircase, which can reach up to its own roof terrace.
The key elements of the reconstruction was the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and replacing them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with modern concepts of networking space.
The social part is opening the saloon door completely connected and the larger society can comfortably communicate with, without also did not maintain the necessary privacy for intimate conversations.
Gaudi house with rebuilding a new facade has won the unusual roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi's impressive is the game with light blue and white glazed tiles, which is lined courtyard, and skylights.
The game delivers a maximum of two colors of light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to gamble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló House, which in 2005 was included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund, each visit.
The first floor is the most spacious and most luxurious apartment opened to the public.
The owners decided to move this up in 2002 to celebrate the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous author.
The survey remained since discovered that this is a very profitable business, plus extended tours and the common attic space, including a roof terrace.
Admission to attractions is certainly not negligible, amounts to 16.50 euros, students, seniors, groups and travel passes are the holders of twenty percent discount.
The amount greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you have to quickly make friends with some of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the grid: women have different requirements than men
Not luxurious bed frame, but the quality lying areas, so the mattress and slatted base gives a really good bed.
It must, however harmonious complement to suit a specific user.
The selection decisions are lots of things from weight, height, age, disability, and gender of the owner.
Important is also the type of interior, in which the mattress and grill buying.
A typical example?
Maybe on a weekend vacation, which regularly does not heat, latex mattresses are not suitable because the slower "heat."
In addition, tend to have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane foam mattress.
It is necessary to turn them regularly.
If you do not have a lot of venting channels in the heart, and still lies on hard board, retains moisture: Could occur beneath the mold.
When selecting a custom decision.
Who spent more time abroad, which often use very high emollient layer of the mattress, it's hard to feel good to be low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who were returning from the NHL, he complained to me that there are sleepless."
"On my battered shoulders, heels and hips needed to soften the mattress with a layer of foam lazy."
"This is recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so ill assume, the information" from the joints and skin, "explains Sylvia Hadamcziková, which specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also to other customers so ago with lazy foam mattress was looking for.
"Today it's okay to be a suitable mattress tempura, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You need not be a guy from the NHL, to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape by the heat absorbed or adapts to your body warm.
Nothing you do not press, the night will not overturn such a tough game.
Just better sleep.
A lazy foam works well as protection against pressure sores.
When choosing the size of your mattress height add one foot length, which is about 21-34 cm.
Man and woman with a height of about 180 cm and in such need of a bed 210-220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be in Double 90cm, together ie 180 cm.
In separate beds, for example singlistů is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise the rule is the width of the bed simple: when lying on your back, you should keep your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Mr.. Helen Prokop, cechmistryně Guild upholsterer and decorator, which is the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture devoted many years and teaches it to colleges.
For everyone needs a double bed and mattress custom grill, be careful here not to buy, to reconcile the height of the mattress.
Otherwise there will not be anything other than fit into grids of different heights, it will not in every frame of the bed may not be possible.
Foam mattress should be at least 14 cm, frame type with a spring at least 15, including at least three centimeters count for shaping and baking the layer.
"Touching hands or touch down on the mattress springs a must feel," warns Helen Prokop.
Each mattress takes a certain type of grill.
Upholstered bed, the mattress and foundation are like conjoined Siamese twins, they have to do in their bedrooms.
Mattresses wrong airing your house, you can not wash the fabric, which is common today.
And since the night vypotíme normally 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat, it is clear that the five to seven years will resemble a mattress great (and congestion) sieve.
That's why experts refuse advertising slogans of life of the mattress to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
Everything is not his but.
Therefore, practical advice from from the sellers: the width of the mattress 120 and 140 cm hygiene, removable and washable cover give up, but rather add a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although it is now commonly manufactured mattress covers with zip around the perimeter, so after opening get two parts (the size of washing machine and very important!), But could handle the larger types (and in one person) to commemorate the battle in capturing light weight in the ring with the heavy.
Hotels in bed instead of a fixed grid plate?
Never!
Up to a bed designed for one-night visit.
The board nevertheless Provide (if not already) and use the air vents with a spring mattress frame and a minimum height of 15 cm with a spring in the bags (from něm.Taschenfederkern) and a layer of baking.
Polyurethane mattresses are not on such a basis.
The slats are nepolohovací 14-18 blades are suitable latex mattresses or sandwich (maybe a combination of latex and coconut), but you always pay the gratings with larger number of blades, 28 or more, where the slats in the lumbar area and can double their stiffness regulated.
The slats are not adjustable mattress spring frame, positioning it to respond.
In addition to tilting the slats can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
This is a special mounting plates, which enables push, or even tilt the plate so that the arm of the sleeper nice "disturb the mold.
For men who are "all over his shoulders back, certainly an important thing.
Even on her remember you and mattress manufacturers who, in "men" began to use the softening zone right in the shoulder area.
The women also remember - those again indulge in the softer surface of the hip places.
For the most demanding customers are aileron or lamellar gratings with the so-called multitorzním suspension.
The pressure decays into more points and reduces tension.
But be careful when you use the correct mattress and pillow rack bad (large "naducaný"), most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: to cushion the head and buttress leaders intervene only to the shoulders to the shoulder muscles to relax.
A suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, the preferred example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side of the pillow should be offset (along with the upper rack cradle or softened zone in the mattress) shoulder height.
Modern mattresses are mattresses filled with native grasses do have something in common.
The manufacturer is increasingly used natural materials, or at least matter.
The trend is just as well for Bio.
Crude oil, which are made of polyurethane foam, are being replaced with natural oils, such as from soy and castor-oil plant.
Now we all use a soy-known manufacturers.
"Organic means the mattress, the core is made of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vasicek Tropico Plus from the company.
Natural products are also used in the production of mattress ticking, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in a microcapsule that can be released fresh scent of lavender or forest.
There is also a division for men and women.
While it may "cool" herbal extract of birch, mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary covers "drowning."
The extract of red pepper increases circulation of blood, so the weaker sex is hotter.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (the larger pores with a damaged cell structure is so breathable than regular polyurethane and has a better elasticity.
Combining different stiffness cold foams and "lazy" multi-zone formed foam mattresses that they know exactly where to be head, shoulders and heels.
Good quality mattress and pay the seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters, tend to have lower rate of VAT shall be taken as medical equipment.
First reached in the Czech Republic, this advantage Gumotex.
Saving the mattress and the grid is not easy.
Sometimes you can use the events to be manufacturers or retailers, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Maybe Mark has Magniflex mattress Duofreeze the memory foam sewn into the cover for the Memory 11 990 crowns.
The second, however, you can get for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density started the "space" at a rate of Tempur material.
Was originally developed for NASA as a material, because startups astronauts were exposed to enormous congestion.
Tempur warm softening, in contrast with the cold strengthens.
Warm human body is so perfectly adapted and spread its optimum pressure.
It is therefore ideally suited to pressure ulcer development, but also to enhance comfort while sleeping.
Viscoelastic foam mattresses for their use, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the legs and feet, which mitigate the venous system.
Domestic producers use such as foam or Twinsaver Eucatherm C and so on.
Apparatus for monitoring people want more and more parents want their children to acting heroic
Fear for their own child brings more people to watch over the idea of ​​GPS.
The system was originally created to search for cars could only monitor the movement of people and thus should help in such cases, such as the disappearance of nine Annie Janatková.
The facility is currently about the size of a matchbox, but it may soon be large just like clockwork.
Many people scared in case missing Annie and began to forage for resources, how to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of disruption to their privacy.
"We all say that it is not no spy, but a means to further reduce the probability that it becomes a tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that a case may lead to misuse of equipment such as when to put in a bag to someone who knows it, but we have not met with such cases."
"Most of them actually sold to customers for security reasons," he added sawdust.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose "box" is and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dan Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like that, it just gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how some things on purpose to lose if they do not want to be under control."
"Great expectations fueled by parents' cell phones before, but which can be switched off as this tracking device," says Bočková.
Under it is questionable whether, in the event of an attack such a device really helps.
"As for the upcoming kidnapping, ensure the perpetrator is almost always the child should not carry any electronics that might reveal his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When we begin to expand tracking devices will look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In this case, the criminals are always one step ahead of police," says psychologist.
He admits, however, that similar devices may help in case of sudden attack pedophile.
According to Robert Cech RC Monitoring of company that provides tracking services for both cars and for people, even when there is a challenge for the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to send regular position after a certain period of time."
"If it becomes damaged, there will be at least the last position of the person."
"The more expensive devices have built and náklonometry, so even if one just slipped and remained lying motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with location," says Czech.
According to him a similar service may be payable as smart mobile phones with navigation, which is enough to load the special software.
The problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device similar size přívěskům matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Always the risk of loss.
According to filings from the Macro Weil and therefore now testing device looks like a conventional digital watch.
"This will have the biggest advantage that any aggressor does not know the tracking device at all."
Or is know for some time and it may give the police extra time, "he adds.
Whether you are tracking facility to make bracelets and pendants, are still using the same technology as that used for monitoring vehicles.
It is a combination of location detection via GPS (which uses regular car navigation) and the functions of a mobile phone, which the current vehicle position reports.
The army has burnt lines that obmotaly Czech Republic. But it lasts only two years
Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of lines, which detonate explosives.
Already last year, while the Ministry of Defence has delivered to the warehouses of 224 km of lines.
Troop and has reserves of 225 years.
The problem is that life is two lines, up to four years.
The Army bought the detonating cord from the stock STV Group, Inc. for 40 million.
The General Staff of the rationale for buying such a huge quantity of combustible cords MF Dnes wrote back to soldiers in training fuses consume 60 km per year.
Army bomb disposal experts from the calculations that the MF Dnes addressed, but that it would be very intense pyrotechnic training had to go through every year and all the generals, officers of the army commanders, secretaries and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick included.
Only thus could be justified by the annual consumption of the army sixty miles fuses.
This period corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were truly, the army reserves remained valid for more than ten years.
However, if true, that the basic training of any new professional just two meters at the most incendiary line, say experts and the military to ensure fresh buying - even with increased consumption of Engineer or special units - the stock at these 225 years.
Rapid Deployment Brigade soldiers while the Minister Vondra personally complained recently that they have almost no ammunition to small arms fire and so are due to shortage of money limited.
The lack of mention of underwear.
"So my head does not it, that you buy from us again so many fuses."
"But it's their decision, and certainly know what they will."
"For us, the army a good customer, who as retailers try to meet," says sales manager John STV Group kids.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejsek warrants purchased by hundreds of miles of lines and that the army will have a stock of "munitions" at least ten years.
John kids in the STV Group, however, speaks only of the four-year life of the fuses and police or army deminers even just two years.
"In a perfect storage, it can be even four," said one, who as a soldier for criticizing the military does not want to disclose the name.
After each life must be carefully tested ammunition that is more reliable and does not endanger the life of soldiers.
These tests are not free and it costs more money.
Another argument is the quantity of the Ministry of 445 km off the ignition leads.
"It cost us about sixty percent less than last year's supply of two hundred forty-four miles," conveys the speaker Pejsek buyers opinion of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: annual consumption of firing lines of police bomb disposal experts, who disposed of ammunition from the Second World War and after the Soviet army for several years, exceeding 1500 meters.
A police orders only such amount to the ammunition consumed before the end of life.
It worked for her safety bomb, and the extra flexibility to acquire more modern and thus more reliable types of lines.
Ministry of Defence has already considerable problems with the liquidation of tens of thousand tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Pact, where dvousettisícová Czechoslovak army was preparing to tow the Rhine.
Then according to Czech presenting MF Dnes approached, waiting a few years the same problem: it will dispose of hundreds of miles of old fuses that are currently "cheap" shops.
To this day I draw from the contacts I gained through competition
Winning prize in the Entrepreneur of the year helped Luke Bagman sell franchises in his hotel.
The winner of last year's Entrepreneur of the year he became an entrepreneur Luke osmadvacetiletý Bagman from Liberec.
His success story is like the movie.
Luke Bagman like to travel.
And abroad to realize that in Liberec lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
The economies of foreign brigades and using a bank loan to buy a house ruined five apartments.
At that time was still a student of third year high school, it was a great spirit.
"At that time the ratio between quality and price of accommodation in this country gave me, as I tried to do something," says Luke Bagman.
The first renovated apartment he rented to foreign workers.
All profits invested back into the house, which is gradually remodeled into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since that time, the seven years of business in Liberec was gradually open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds across all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was recently Bagman star design hotel.
This year for him but there was another, equally good.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, where we sold our franchise concept and others interested in the franchise hotel Bagman's voice," says last year's number one trader.
"And the sale of the license to operate the hotel is very much involved in just winning the competition, Entrepreneur of the year," he says appreciatively Bagman.
The victory brought him more reputation and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People get to know me in the streets, often additionally congratulated me and I must say it felt good," he recalls.
Participation in the competition strongly encourages all who are interested in trying something.
It is not necessary to win each visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances, which would perhaps not otherwise get.
"With some I've met through competition, I became a regular business."
Glory be associated with success in his landed a bit to each employee.
And that there is about seventy years.
"I see them at greater loyalty and pride that is involved in something that gained universal recognition."
"It's much more than just my personal success is the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is thrust into the forefront," says Luke Bagman modestly today.
I wish my successor quieter year than we had in Farmet
Euphoria of victory, quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
With self-discipline but the winner has Farmet bad times behind him.
For the prize for first place in last year's Vodafone Company of the Year last year in a Slav house came Farmet company owner, Charles Žďárský.
The jury then commended the efforts by which the tool has built a small workshop in the Czech Republic, Opava stamilionovými business with turnovers.
"I can say that the awards encourage not only me but all my colleagues and increase our confidence for the match with the competition there," said defending champion.
In the early history of the company Farmet was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered the father of Charles Žďárského to rent a small workshop to compensate for the communists confiscated property, did not hesitate long, rejected a career in the firm, where he was working, and a few friends about his father founded the company in the plastic tub.
Soon after the press began to specialize in vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic machines in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the general public a company came after the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have begun to perceive the brand Farmet much better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they work with a company that has achieved more in his country's success," says Charles Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not only marked FARMET euphoria of victories.
Awards are based on firm economic performance until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
Peaked crisis that is still touching so many people, but companies have stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology.
"The situation is obviously not spared us."
"Sales fell 40 percent, we had to restrict production and to release occurred," said Charles Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to do even this sometimes unpopular measures.
Situation but managed to keep them in business and profits, even though less than before the crisis.
However, from what FARMET not compromise, the investment in research and development.
"The subsidies we have built research and training center, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won major awards in local exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Revenue is growing and so are the number of new employees.
"The new champions have a nice feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Charles Žďárský.
The survey, which removes nonsensical rules
Poll of the Absurdities of the fourth part of the business competition.
Some rules are ridiculous already been removed.
Infamous winner of next year's poll was the absurdity of the obligation to wear to the office documents that officials are accessible online.
Decided more than a third less than four thousand votes.
For example, Social Security Administration require a paper certificate of incorporation, although the officer to obtain the two clicks a mouse.
Thanks to the poll this change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration has an extract from the Commercial Register at the controls of contributors will be required," said spokesman John Buráňová CSSA.
Crack down on all the rules and regulations that companies have a business in the Czech Republic meet, and you cancel the meaningless absurdity of a sense of competition.
This is the fourth time this year, part of the corporate race, held Hospodářské newspapers and the public are becoming increasingly popular.
If the vote last year involved about three thousand voters earlier this year there were nearly four thousand.
And not surprisingly, various legal obligations, which only serves to delay the business is still with us enough.
"Maybe in the number of papers on tax returns are in the forefront in the world," said Karel Havlicek to the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts CR.
Simplification of business in recent years become a stated objective of all governments.
Compared with the world but in the Czech Republic does not improve the situation terribly.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in terms of business conditions was ranked 74th position, it is eight points less than last year.
The absurdity of the competition was first launched in 2006 and takes place every year under the same scenario.
Log on administrative and bureaucratic nonsense for anyone year from April to September, when is the deadline for the competition.
The web address is logged www.firmaroku.cz Then the organizer of the seven candidates to choose "anticenu" and allow for it in October to vote on the public internet sites www.firmaroku.cz / Absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity of who gets the most votes wins.
In this survey was filed more than a hundred, 105 more laws and regulations meaningless.
Tips received from entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" contest as between himself nominated as the requirement that the trucks for maintenance of highways and toll roads paid, or to businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets painted every two years.
The list of this year's Sevens proposals is posted on the contest website.
Announcement of the competition, which always takes place in early November, on Wenceslas Square in Prague is part hapenning, regularly participates in the political and social life.
This year, for example, at the climax of the competition assisted Eva Svoboda, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts CR and Petr Kuzel, president of the Economic Chamber.
"Economic prosperity can not work where the state is throwing business in its own foot, so my goal is to withdraw each year for at least three dozen paragraphs, which today only unnecessarily complicate the business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to abolish rather positive load of nonsense.
In 2007 most people were against the obligation to report the business three days ahead of the trade office at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention is to go stand at the exhibition or fair.
This has been an amendment to the Trade Act removed.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which has been reported to the Labour Office for its foreign staff in the mission up to 30 days, the law removed the so-called green card.
And thirdly, all good.
Absurdity in 2009 became of physiotherapists in the office have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two stepping scales.
It was in this year's Ministry of Health mitigated - to have a refrigerator has fallen off.

In one case, for example, relates to people with disabilities and elsewhere to be personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists federals finds itself with software such as Prague by ET niece who supports the creation of informal sports teams of staff who will then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of responsible companies from the Pardubice region, the company Isolit-Bravo, who is seventeen years a major contributor to the endowment fund sponzorujícího handicapped children.
About its disabled employees back to the old mill of Podebrady, who has more than 70 percent, and were thus responsible title company in the Central Region competition, Vodafone has placed the company in the region as a third.
The Olomouc region wins MiRyz Soft accounting firm, which has introduced flexible working hours, in addition to the reduced average 35 hours per week, but not proportionately reduced salary.
The title was awarded to her also for the priority which it buys from Czech manufacturers, promotes civic activities in the neighborhood and saving the environment.

"Single sign just for this competition is not possible because it is a sub company of the main competition," says Charles Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
The Land Fund in Plzen police arrested the contest
The building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days the police arrested an anti-corruption.
Handcuffs detectives put local businesses in the media sector and real estate dealer Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the current tender for the settlement of restitution claims, so that the site offered was awarded to a particular candidate.
He considered that Mr Luboš pay half a million.
"So far I can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for the offense of fraudulent manipulation of public procurement and public tenders," said boss Pravo Pilsner prosecution Antony Green, with the additional detail with respect to ongoing investigations can not provide.
Šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs police released after 24 hours of freedom.
About how it could affect the tender, can be due to a low of official information only speculate.
A spokesman Lyubomir Black Land Fund to the question rightly stated that the detached work in Plzen police actually arrested, and during the contest.
"It was a client, not our employees," he said.
The public tender, according to Brown the correct name "Invitation to tender for the transfer of land rights under the law of the land" and takes place when the land offered to interested more eligible applicants.
"These people in the call to offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the announced value of the land."
"The claims offered by the acquirer and the order of the Land Fund then transferred land to the person who offered the highest standards," said fund spokesman.
Mr Lubomir probably should have information, who subscribes to the call, and since he is also a beneficiary, it bought a number of restitution claims on land offered to the candidates that participate.
For it probably cashed in compensation.
That would explain that he was detained at such a large sum of money.
Lubos G was superior to PF contacts had already worked in the past.
Figured in the case of former chief PF Sankot Vaclav, who was prosecuted for that published in the spare land restitution, which has already been a decision on the location of the building.
It was then acquired by Mr Lubos fund such land for the construction of public roads, particularly at the point where the driveway was to build a highway to the industrial zone Borska field.
Later, it is very conveniently exchanged with the city for a house in the historic town center, which had a value much higher.
At the town hall had to accept it, because otherwise the land by blocking the construction of compromise.
Households pay extra for housing hundreds a month
Households will have to pay more since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heating supplies, and rents will rise somewhere.
Families will have to pull out from January to the purses of money over a month now.
Electricity will raise the price up by 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some towns will have to pay extra for water and often also more expensive supply of central heating.
Electricity price increase should come home in the flats a year of one hundred crowns more expensive than now.
Prices of energy while all the major suppliers to reduce to blame is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
Although slightly more expensive gas, but when most people are drowning and have the highest consumption.
Annually must also consider the addition of money.
While electricity and gas more expensive across the country, central heating price change varies from place to place.
Price increase plan mainly larger community.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kralove paid since January as the central heating by about 50 per month extra on more than 1,000 crowns a year to pay the family in.
Residents of Prague again threatened them by more than 9 percent more expensive water and sewer, in the event that the city increase the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, you pay extra Roasted 6.8 percent.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in a nationwide comparison between lower.
The North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water rate increase by about 7.4 percent.
For example, can significantly increase the price of rent in 450 thousands of rental apartments, where regulation ends in January.
For example, CPI Flats, which in Usti nad Labem owns about 2,500 apartments, plans to raise the rent from January up to one hundred percent.
Those who do not to accept the new rents, the company intends to put to trial.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments, next year could increase by up to ten percent.
Czech children binge drink Fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally better brand of whiskey stolen parents.
These are the drinks, after which most often ends in drinking care physicians drunks who have not even fifteen years.
The exceptions are children who are from monkeys treated at the hospital again.
This follows the experience of physicians who are confronted with similar cases in the revenue department of children's hospitals.
"Any beer or wine is completely unfashionable, it takes a long time before they get drunk."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," he told Pravo Senior Consultant Department of Children's Hospital in central Bohemia Hoøovice Ludek Pelican.
"If they can pull out a bottle of her father from the closet, so it must be the whiskey, but otherwise dominated Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it is served in juice, and not many of them feel," said head physician.
And in truth it gives the speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Jurinová Eve.
"Not often is it Fernet or rum."
"It is today a modern spirit especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, a plum brandy, which he brought from home," said Jurinová.
According to the chief of the pelican are thirteen or fourteen drinkers in a hospital receiving a relatively common phenomenon.
Before Hořovice, which has been operating since this year, he worked for ten years just in pediatrics Motol, where ambulances collecting befuddled schoolchildren from the surrounding area.
"One girl was lying around in our times."
"He started his career at the age of twelve, when it was brought to us with a 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood addition in combination with ecstasy," said the doctor particularly serious case.
"She was on the Exhibition Grounds for a dance party."
"It is interesting that her mother did not come at all strange that their daughter did not know 48 hours," said the chief physician.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring is considered a major cause of growing children pijanství.
The dependence in the true sense, but according to experts, children can not speak.
"The term means a several-alcoholic chronic alcoholism, with all the phenomena to which they belong, and it is not for children."
"For those who use alcohol frequently, is more associated with unsuccessful family-social background," said head physician of the Pelican.
According to the spokesman Jurinová year in the pediatric clinic in Motol hospitalized in mid November, about forty drunken children.
The statistics, however, receive only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital.
Child drunk, you take them for outpatient treatment of parents or the police transported them home, are not counted.
Except where kids just sit around after school and drink a bottle of brandy, according to the Pelican, there are three seasonal fluctuations, which can rely on: Witches, New Year and the end of the school year.
"It's either sadness washed down the wrong certificate or, conversely, celebrate the start of the holiday."
"But I experienced the witch on income up to seven children at one time drunks," said Pelikan.
The drunk, who spends the night detoxification under medical supervision, is paradoxically an advantage compared to that at home the next day vytrpí unpleasant hangover.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose is infused with irrigation chase glucose and nutrients that the body is lacking.
"They actually are doing better because they have the experience that beautiful evening and a good wake up and nothing hurts."
"Only they are confused about where they are," said the Pelican with the fact that patients sometimes spoils a pleasant mood for at least a list of costs that their treatment required.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization in an acute bed is coming out to thousands of dollars.
"Sometimes I apply as an educational resource, when I direct those children to a vision, then calculate how much they became drunk, and that could also spend the summer in the brigade to make money on this one party," said Pelikan.
Insurance companies, however, he said to the regression procedure in which the parents should enforce the cost of treatment in cases of child drunks nigh.
Two L-159 are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 of a total of five pieces for the Czech Defense Ministry has exchanged transport aircraft CASA C-295M, on Tuesday flew to Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer based Casa - EADS.
It is the first time that the machines of this type appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
Abroad, has only been in the seminars and demonstration flights.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1 aircraft, which has operated Czech army and were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-L-159.
Those still standing conserved in Aero Vodochody and brokers - the company Omnipol - took them last week.
When the aircraft physically dispatch a Vodochody, according to John, not the boys from the Press Department of Defense has known.
"Single-seat L-159 has been allocated for the shift from long-stored aircraft, and without any deposits and investments by the Ministry."
"Two-seat L-159T1 aircraft were converted to the current situation and form," he told Pravo dog.
He added that the army is left without the two-seat aircraft, because the ministry in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody signed a contract worth 200 million crowns to the reconstruction of four redundant L-159 machines in two two-seat machines.
One aircraft took a new army in July, the other takes over until the end of this year.
According to EADS is committed to your dog that the aircraft equipment to enforce some NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the purchaser of the L-159, EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore of customers, how to implement this thing," said the boy.
Economic newspapers recently reported that as the Spanish army with L-159 is not interested.
Replacement of five L-159 aircraft for one Casa and buy three more aircraft for 3.5 billion approved last year, led by Mirek Topolanek.
Nevypsalo Ministry of Defence to purchase the tender and addressed directly to EADS.
The former lead defense argued that the exchange will promote further exports L-159 abroad.
Czech Army has bought from Aero 72 machines and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
Purchase Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence sued by the European Court because the aircraft was selected on the basis of a European tender and not reaching the same manufacturer.
The Army has already acquired three aircraft Casa should last at Prague airport Kbely arrive within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index finger than ring finger are at lower risk of prostate cancer.
It is surprising conclusions of a study published on Wednesday, British journal of cancer.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative finger length may serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for a man to 60 years," said study co-author Eelesová Ros, Professor, Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could then help determine which men should undergo tests for prostate cancer, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, she said Eelesová.
In the period 1994-2009 followed with colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and in parallel over three thousand healthy men.
More than half the study participants had a finger on his right hand is shorter than ring finger.
Apply to them the same as the probability of prostate cancer for 19 percent of those whose fingers are of equal length.
For those who have a longer index finger than ring finger, but this risk decreased by 33 percent for men in the sixties was even a 87 percent decline.
The ratio of the length of those two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - probably reflects different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous studies have shown that it is increasing testosterone promotes prostate cancer.
Leading geneticist and former Czech President, Academy of Sciences Professor Vaclav Paces for ČTK said that a cursory study of this knows, but it seems he said that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer was "fully proven."

Based on the report in the London newspaper "The Independent" is present 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard said he knows the exact location.
Internet activist has always marked the investigations in Sweden, machinations of his opponents.
Kristinn Hrafnsson Wikileaks spokesman in London said that there is also threats.
"Even the call for the murder of Julian Assange.
Therefore Assange rightly fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to the findings of North America.
In America, asked the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that the person responsible for the Publishing on the Wikileaks charged for treason and executed.
In Canada, said in a television consultant leader Stephen Harper's government - perhaps ironically, Assange should be "assassinated" and Obama could use the "target plane."
Meanwhile raged between the White House and Assange flame war.
A spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for the recent spy call diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we are interested in the opinion of one person with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than his website."
The U.S. government is now examining the safety of its extensive databanks.
The special envoy was appointed Deputy Director of the Centre for anti-terrorist measures Russell Travers, said the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure, which is necessary after the publication of reports from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the entire government and protects the information exchanged.
The U.S. government also announced that he wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, if they should get into danger because of publication on Wikileaks.
"We took everything with them to get in touch," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect, insofar as it would be necessary."
Ice cream University
The "Gelato University" in Bologna preparing pastry cream for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream, which lasts three days, there is great interest and visitors come from around the world.
Where does the ice come from?
From Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech bit old-fashioned ice cream, cream produced by all the rules zmrzlinářského Italian art.
She pulls out a spatula Gelataio ice cream cooler, wipe it and sell the wafers.
To see this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about the ice cream, to avoid the "Gelato-University ', the Italian firm Carpigiani.
In 2003 established manufacturer of ice cream machines ice cream university to its ice-cream machines fit all Italian high ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, it is huge interest and visitors come from around the world.
There is also several special courses on chocolate ice cream and ice-cream in their own practice.
Someone wants her in-midlife Crisis for a new career, others weigh on the thin ice of their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary after Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and in the future would like to offer a quality product in the country of the European Industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin, a business consultant and would like after years of work stressful start something of their own.
Two young Egyptians dream of Cairo in the open ice-cream.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of their ice cream bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia arrived, because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Luciano Ferrari Gelatiere first explained to participants the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream.
Crucial not only taste good but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano forget during his training at the southern and patriotic icing on the cake, "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then to one more great deal of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats up the electronic program all at 85 degrees and then immediately cooled to four degrees.
Then turn on the machine has drained the water and pasteurized cream white base, the base for all types of dairy ice cream.
Is an associate professor immediately pelted questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural ingredients without any preservative?
How can you experiment yourself?
Luciano warns run away with the zeitgeist into the unknown.
Who speaks for ice cream "only natural ingredients," apparently used as stabilizers - mostly natural products, such as guar flour guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizers, but must be sold within a day, collide, and otherwise the customers the very grains of ice.
Some variations of the basic materials are permitted.
It will be exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguish the taste of ice cream ingredients according to the supermarket to buy either the department or the department of fruit sweetness.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Vendors will be trying to force a lot of flavored ingredients."
"You should, but simply to experiment."
Bud and fruit sorbets with fresh fruit and sugar.
Or ice cream white base material that turns eggs into a yellow cream and cocoa to the base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now may be involved in the course of ice cream machines.
Luciano is always allowed to make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavoring and other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is made with fruit ice cream flavors.
More aromatic, more fruit puree - because taste is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not taste more nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
Favorite ice cream kiwis produce a group that uses more fruit and less water and a little less of the stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture of taste Gelato highlight correctly, says Luciano.
Manufacture of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If you use a lot of peach puree with sugar, to reduce sugar content in the basic recipe.
The lemon ice is a need for an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out the device, which determines the sugar content in fruit (measured by winemakers from grape juice).
Fortunately, the number of tables ease.
Manufacture of ice cream does not require much physical effort as before.
Does not only a device to automatically produce the basic materials.
There is also a unit that finished ice cream mixture into the cream while umíchá and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation we can not avoid small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo dirty himself and his colleagues from top to bottom of fruit puree, when he gets out of control a huge mixer.
"At any rate, Maestro Luciano believes," it's only a matter of time before something like this happens. "
Supervisors in the two light
EFSA European Food is linked with industry which is experimenting with genetic plants.
This allegation now raised Testbiotech expert group, which is regarded as an independent institute to estimate the effects of biotechnology.
"It sounds like conspiracy theories, but we did well documented," he said Wednesday in Munich boss Testbiotechu Christoph Then.
Head of the EFSA Panel gentechnicky modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA expert with several years of the contract with union lobbyists ILSI.
It is funded by corporations such as Monsanto, Bayer or Nestle.
Kuiper is involved in a decisive manner to control for genetic conditions Efsa plants and is thus a clear conflict of interest, criticizing then.
EFSA said regulations consistent throughout the document paragraph with ILSI and carry the style industry, which should be controlled by the Authority in Parma, Italy.
It's the second time that Testbiotech attention to conflicts of interest.
Recently moved from high Efsa manager or without addition of the transitional period to the Swiss group Syngenta agrarian - and thus changed sides.
Also the radio for Central Germany (MDR) recently unveiled personnel to link the EU-office control with industrial lobby, which piqued the interest of both the Ministry of Environment and members of the EU.
Meanwhile Efsa not recognize a conflict of interest.
Works with all reliable data, and therefore also those of industry, where high-quality expert, stated in a statement.
From the experts working for EFSA is required, not to be in contact with industry.
But must be verified.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
Itself is known as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy - among other things for risk assessment of biotechnology without a contract lobbyist.
Then as independent experts criticize that are currently permitted gentechnicky modified plants in animal feed without any attempt, and that does not test for genetic responses of plants to the influences of the environment.
"We want to know what makes such gentechnicky modified corn in the field," said Then.
Current practice is only to test the isolated protein and not a genetic plant, which can demonstrate reliable results.
"If you are looking for risk, as it was then possible to find them?" Asked the defense then.
Agrees with the Angelika Hilbeck.
Researcher examines gentechniku ​​since 1994 and currently works at the Technical College in Zurich.
In this area, trying to industry as well as in the U.S., now also in Europe more and more critical influence or discredit scientists.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who were not connected with the concerns.
Usually do not publish studies that are critical for the company.
"Industry controls the security research ', believes Hilbeck.
Trail of stones
Uli Gsell also issued a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, standing outside the station in Stuttgart, the tube on the back.
It was a demonstration.
Snowfall.
The story is known: In September diggers arrived and began tearing down a large piece of the north wing.
World in Stuttgart has been the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, miliardovému reduction station.
When he reached the suspension of construction, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken 6000, 7000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, soft and rough stone, which was used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
Clinched several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Do not go."
Enthuses: "Cheap and poor rock, simple and primitive."
When one slit, smelled the cigarette smoke.
What will those bits do not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli also Gsell.
Trail of stones from Stuttgart leads into the forest near Tübingen, the former French army munitions dumping sites, where Manuel Rongen stone built his empire.
44-year-old business with old stones.
He bought all of which occurred during demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if rozemlely on gravel or disappeared in the waste dumps," he says in his office, a wooden booth, which was formerly a house guard.
She says that he cursed and threatened him, when in September in all the newspapers said that bought the remnants of the northern wing of the company that carries out the demolition.
But he talked all day with rivals S-21.
And explained that the demolition did not at all.
And when it happens, it is still sensible, though the use of blocks away.
Then he took about 200 S-21-opponents each one about 80 kg heavy block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also in the hope that it will return the re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, 25 large cargo trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long been sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over and dragged as to fit into a suitcase and a trailer.
Stones from Stuttgart dispute turned into a long "wall" or as the edges of the beds of herbs.
"This stone is nothing special," said Rongen.
"Were it not for the political nipples."
Get in your car and driving off-road for a ride after his 20-hectare UK.
He studied law first, studies interrupted, then biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a trader with stones.
A lover of stones.
It has saved 40,000 tons of stones.
Buries its treasures from all over Germany.
He says it is the largest trader of old stone in the country.
Back.
The snow is artistically shaped sandstone.
"One belonged to the Marien bridge in Dresden," he says.
From the Elbe Sandstone, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
Going farther up the road through the forest.
It shows a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And more.
"Nice travertine.
Once the blocks were the grandstand Neckarstadionu in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories of the travertine-Cannstatt Police Headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Saint Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What works, what effort, what a sweat.
Rongen When one thinks of it as first breaking stones by hand and transported by a simple pulley and bull-carts, it will be totally respectful.
"It would be a scandal after all, if something broke."
He did not become rich, very rich already not at all.
Merchant stones but now employs 14 people in addition to the top of the forest settled masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says one who appreciates leftovers.
A soon to be in Cologne.
There will also save the stones.
Fight talents of high-potentials
The food is a lot of people.
16 students are pushing for sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
Technical University of Braunschweig and automobile manufacturer Volkswagen to invite students to engineering and design workshop.
Together with the developers here have the VW company to talk about the car of the future - and the only way to know the Volkswagen.
Many companies are seeking in the race for the smartest of the head, as well as the Volkswagen company to succeed, and relies on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most talented graduates in lecture halls, before they reach the labor market and will be interested others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of their students' success, the company tries to find exceptional talents in projects oriented to practice and get them.
At TU Braunschweig car group is trying to acquire talent the other day.
One young lady from the personnel department gives out pens, teddy bears and rubber plates with the VW logo.
It tells the budding young talents on programs for practitioner, student jobs and shows them the way to the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig cares about the project together with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW may also identify students to experience the interesting candidates and think about who would be cast as a collaborator."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
News is that so openly struggling students.
"Otherwise it was more significant special project," said Sella.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, businesses are no longer able to withdraw their staff from the candidates long hosts.
On the other hand must try and try to attract particularly high-skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering courses have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI in October remained vacant 40,000 engineers.
A predicted shortage of engineers called VDI rise.
The auditing and consulting firm KPMG as Roman Dykta to hunt talent.
Recruiting hard-organizes events such as KPMG, race, type of modern race for the treasure, in which participants must find a way according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to deploy next year follows eight promising students in the USA.
Participants can also see KPMG's offices and meet with the company.
Pre decide in two rounds of selection, who will participate.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly to the U.S..
In the fight for high potentials in the universities will pay more under Dykty tougher laws.
"We want to race with our distinguished from the others."
"A simple trip on a sailing ship was too small for us."
It seems that the talent scout Dykta lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in similar events in the past year."
"Some of them will soon end, and plan to study with us apply for a job," he says.
In addition to directly addressing on the campus of mainly small and medium business market presents a classic work.
"We try to contact alumni in professional shows."
"As an example of Intersolar," says Sith stub, head of personnel department of the manufacturer of solar technology solar car.
Company of Bonn in Germany employs around 1,500 staff.
Stube known issue with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions listed on the website of the company.
"At the moment it is just difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another possibility is through contact professors at universities.
Solar car works with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers report that it is possible to do in our practice or write a thesis."
Solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising campaign.
Instead of trying to lure other business advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Large corporations often can not offer," said the head of Human Resources Stube.
The job search has long been a money play a major role.
Flexible working hours, child care and good advancement opportunities are other key factors.
Solar car finished in one study, the Institute Great Place to Work 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition to asking employees how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and monitor the framework conditions for employees.
Head of Human Resources Stube hopes that it will point the location of the job seekers.
"I believe that students who are especially informed on the external evaluations of potential employers," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
Advises its customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Krieglera that means internal measures.
"The best way to be seen as an attractive employer goes through its own employees," he says.
Professionally it is called Internal Employer Branding, thus enforcing the employer market under its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
As well, the company cares for its people, and they identify with the company, will be on their own to advertise his employer's friends and relatives.
"It's a tie game," said Kriegler.
Obama stop new oil drilling
During the following years arise from the coast of the U.S. Federal-State Florida Gulf Coast new oil wells.
The government in Washington issued an appropriate ban - and finally canceled earlier plans.
Also from the Atlantic coast are still banned new wells.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said Wednesday it.
The reason for the strict ban that would have paid at least the next five years, the explosion on an oil tower, "Deepwater Horizon in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven lives of workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the onslaught of industry opposition and their willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters by trying to reduce U.S. dependence on oil from abroad.
To date, it is not clearly explained who was responsible for a devastating disaster in the Gulf oil.
The center of criticism is an energetic British group BP, which is faced billions applications.
Commission of Inquiry, which commissioned Obama should produce results in December.
In October the Minister of the Interior set aside the ban on drilling Ken Salazar, who paid from the explosion.
Subsequently, the oil corporations have made various requests for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar wants to prevent a similar disaster tighter controls and strict safety regulations.
Currently fundamentally reformed Audit Office, has attracted attention of many corruption allegations.
At the same time Obama has announced that it canceled the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion by the oil and gas corporations.
The industry is now openly warned that stringent regulation significantly reduces the amount of extracted oil in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest drag on growth in oil and gas industry," is the result of a survey in the field of consulting firm BDO - even before the ban on drilling in the middle.
American Energy Alliance have yet to complain of the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows exactly what the regulations will change."
Investment in new mining projects until further notice, move - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni area burned
Water in rivers is oily brown, smells like a gas station: million gallons of oil leaked destroy nature in the Ogoni area of ​​Nigeria.
People living stealing, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Do not worry," reassures journalists environmental activist: "Today you get a camera lens still enough oil mud."
37-year-old attempt to capture Nigeriánec tailed boy who wades through the breasts with water, surrounded by streaks: the scene for the water shine with rainbow colors almost nicely.
That float beneath the surface of brown clots of oil is not visible.
There has garnered enough garnel in containers, says Esther Bado riverside Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water was completely dead.
Five years ago, poured into a huge warm the broken lines of large amounts of oil.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo to paddle at least six hours to get into the water where the fish are: the Ogoni area, which is located in the heart of the Niger River delta is one of the worst contaminated areas of the world.
On the way down the river mangrove swamps with lots of tributaries is still noticeable the whole range of triggers.
The motor boat to boil water instead of light brown mush and he dipped his hand into the water, oil pulls fingers.
The roots of the mangroves rises from the ground like black licorice stick, a rare palm trees let their leaves hang sadly.
In vain looking for flocks of birds, which are commonly found in moist areas: Once you go quiet motor boat, got a little earlier in paradise, where it smells like a gas station, spooky silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological warfare," said Celestine Akpobari sadly: "We live in constant fear of their health."
Comparison with the war is justified.
Settlement in the Ogoni area of ​​the battlefield, where fighting for decades: in front of more than 60 years ago, I poured the first conquerors of Europe, here in the 80 fashioned the first years of resistance to later executed by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, Shell Group had here in 1993 to stop its production because it was too dangerous for staff.
Even today in the Ogoni area of ​​the company not to return: while the daily benefit of the entire delta area triple the size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining, drilling and management of 7000 km more than two million barrels of black gold, oil fields lie in the Ogoni area of ​​fallow for the Group's the situation too unstable.
Every few hundred yards from the water tower steel structure as a bizarre sculpture: "Christmas trees," so too fondly called the head of drilling holes.
They are 50 years old, most of the fiercest rusty.
Every now and then break that head drill hole, tells Akpobari, and then issues a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to expert estimates spilled into the ecosystem in the Delta, more than two billion liters in 50 years: Every year the quantity of oil, which spilled into the sea at the crash of Alaska supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There are over who is to be no longer lasting ecological disaster responsible.
While Shell Group refers to organized sabotage and theft of crude oil at more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental conservationists talk about cracking heads wells and leaking lines as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires a much lower safety standards than is customary in the world, accused the group in 2008, US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of failures in the management were "several times higher than elsewhere."
The site, which looks from afar like an abandoned, dirty oil in the open-air workshop, arises from the mangroves are the characters: they are completely naked, and fed up of oils.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly related to leadership, some randomly scattered around the country, burning with fire: illegal small refineries.
Oil in the barrel is heated over the fire for several hours, said Michael, a group leader.
First to come out of the lead-capture pot petrol, then dropping onto the end of the line kerosene and diesel eventually.
This method produced by Michael and his four colleagues to four barrels a day for 300 liters, "so you will earn 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta using a chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing countries of Black Africa.
Nigeria have only one refinery.
Ridiculously low price of 40 euro cents per liter of fuel can still trump the illegal manufacturers: they have free raw material.
It comes from the "Bunker," which are connected to lead all of the Ogoni: according to experts at the forefront of the Niger River delta region is losing ground daily for at least 16 million liters of oil.
But only a negligibly small portion of the raw materials are temporarily stored illegally upgrades: The largest proportion of filled organized criminal networks, which belong to the politicians and senior army officials, the tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether caused havoc residents and their interventions or lax mode of production, it Akpobari activist as purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered as an intruder and had so completely destroy the essence of life of fishermen, then it was not sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, but the relationship is primarily for the Ogoni and Shell damaged that comes into consideration only the departure of the group: "You may show other nations like the Chinese to be better."
Michael unsettles.
"It was time to disappear," says producer muscular.
"Every moment can come soldiers."
If he found a special military unit, so they say there is no prison, but painful bribe.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north country - like all Nigeriánci - they want to benefit from raw material.
"Tadla damn thing got our country in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous mistake in building the A380 engines
The A380 is obviously a big security flaw.
Investigators found during the inspection machine, which made an emergency landing, possible construction flaw that could lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
Airline Qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of engines.
Qantas Airbus passenger had an emergency landing early November probably more luck than previously known: Australian Aviation Safety Authority found in its investigations huge security failure in some machines the A380 engines - and now warns of a possible construction error.
Possible defects should dire consequences: one oil concentration could arise due to wear cracks, this was said Thursday in a statement published by the ATSB's office.
This could lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
These engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in the 20 A380 aircraft series.
Among them is a Qantas Airbus, which had the fourth November emergency landing in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against British turbine manufacturers.
She of the action, the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said that his company will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During a fire engine to loosen the damaged parts and bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of the damage burning oil.
After this event, to be replaced throughout the world up to 40 engines.
Australian investigators reported that more safety tests carried out with the giant aircraft, which are concerned with engines.
Safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce spokesman said the ATSB Martin Dolan.
Lack of safety was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After an emergency landing machine airline Qantas had its A380 fleet for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines retained three of its eleven A380 temporarily in the country.
Lufthansa A380 exchanged with one engine as a safety measure.
Double decker aircraft is the largest passenger airliner in the world.
National Snow causes traffic chaos
Germany, all in white: nearly the entire country overnight snowfall.
On many roads in chaos, train and plane connections are lost.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: almost all the snaps in the Republic on Thursday night in freezing temperatures with snow - which leads to many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east lies in some places up to 15 inches of snow.
On several roads and many roads are very limited right.
On the A7 for Flensburg service road was still in use, but did not manage the new windblown snow.
This was still a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
Federal Office for the navigation and hydrography (BSH) is expected on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Schleswig-Holstein am roaring flood water level is 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow drifts caused in Saxony state highways and major roads problems.
According to the central weather Meteomedia was thus in Saxon Switzerland ECP violet - the highest level.
In part there occurred 30 cm of new snow and strong winds caused drifts fresh.
At night, there remained a few trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported a major problem on the roads.
On the A2 wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, the problem is due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German track is the great difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, northern Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the rails, overturned trees on the track and smashed the top lines and switches.
In Saxony, had to be stopped by remote operation from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
Saalfeld in Thuringia had to stop an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers got on the train firefighters and paramedics from the woolen blankets, food and drink.
Wind blew snow across roads.
At major German airports were canceled due to snow winds many flights.
Headquarters, spokeswoman for the flight information has been reported from Munich flights canceled out.
In Frankfurt am Main nach lifted spokeswoman Fraport has 40 flights.
Maintenance of roads is in constant use.
Although the airport remained only a few passengers without connections, it is ready for them, but 400 field beds.
On many roads there on Wednesday evening to accidents.
In the evening he died a truck driver in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was lightly injured.
Because of the snowy road near Nuremberg was a similar incident: there was a truck caught on a railroad crossing because the vehicle is stuck.
The driver died.
The train injuring four passengers - a route from Nürnberg to Bayreuth remained so until the early hours closed.
And a dead one 30-year-old woman after Aschaffenburg in his car overturned on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have but still good news: the snow remains in the form of light powder snow, and so will the light gusts of wind rising.
But the wind weakens.
Only the Baltic Sea will be quick storm force winds.
But it's very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for the twin-towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to your sign: according to a newspaper's Posts merchant bank for two towers with offices in the headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank, just renovated its office group: twin-towers in Frankfurt's banking district to modernize, between the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
Now he wants but obviously the financial cost of the renovation group back again - and looking for buyers for the two skyscrapers, reports "Financial Times Deutschland," referring to the speaker.
A spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still examining whether it makes more sense to own property or sell and then lease back," he said.
This is the largest credit institute in Germany again shortly after abandoning its corporate headquarters.
The bank took over the tower-twins only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors own the fund and subsequently renovated expensive.
Energy conversion swallowed, according to some 200 million euros.
Sales would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Experts in the field estimate according to a newspaper text value between tower renamed to "Greentowers" the price of around 500 million euros.
A spokesman said it was not decided whether to sell the building back into the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of the buried miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions at the mine.
Still failed to deliver the dead shaft because the security situation remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago was in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth on the powerful explosion.
29 miners aged 17-62 years were below overwhelmed.
The shaft where the accident occurred, the probe is running, but not found any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosion could not come down for safety of the volunteers.
After the second explosion came out strong authorities and experts from the fact that miners no longer have any chance of survival.
We are unable to redeem the dead.
Now, honor the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand with ten thousand people gathered on a sunny day.
Silent for two minutes.
Order to commemorate the miners were buried in 1929 built the tables on their helmets, lights, and the names of the miners.
Also, pictures and personal belongings such as clothing and surfboards have found their place here.
On state government buildings flew flags at half mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners come from the "depths" to the surface, said participants in the commemorative events for Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But never come home."
Can not part with her son until saw his corpse, Drew said Lawrie, whose son, Zen was overwhelmed at the mine.

Hell, Warriors!
Suitable for horror art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to climb back to its old borders battle epic "Valhalla Rising."
On what the audience thought about Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn when he was shooting "Valhalla Rising"?
Captured by Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his tormentors and in great kills with almost supernatural strength of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men viewers seeking bloody action, since our hero helps the cruel methods of killing and its enemies even tearing of the abdominal viscera alive, though in a bad mood.
On the other hand, one eye, as it is in fact called, throughout the movie say a word uttered, and even the other characters at most one or two sentences or be swayed by the cries of dying strastiplným.
Otherwise it is silent, and revel in the horror beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the world about the Vikings a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for a more adult theater enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good when a movie has more than one target group is a pity, though they are mutually exclusive.
Winding Refn director, after he made his wild and stylized trilogy about the drug dealers "Pusher" is considered a version of the Danish film director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically defending their work closer to either more humor and less mainstream art audience brutality.
Most fans of art cinema will probably be put off by all splashing brains and guts.
Fans of action movies unudí later than the time when the issue of wild-eyed vysvětlitelných reasons, violent group of Christian missionaries by boat to Jerusalem and stay there forever in the wind and fog than likely team arrives in America and there are more silent.
There is therefore no surprise that in Germany "Valhalla Rising" not in theaters and has now been released on DVD only.
It's a shame especially because of wonderful shots, but also because the distinctive facade, sometimes almost ruined by blood, hiding exciting cinema that deserve some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or the exact storyline is all atmosphere, feverish dream, which became the film.
And it is no escape for the viewer.
Refn nedopřeje a moment he relaxed and slowly suffocates its images of freezing and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but most of unspeakable hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blond boy who helps a one-eyed, keep something like innocence, all the rest are powered by anger.
Most of all one-eyed hero whose motives are never explain, which becomes time for enemies and allies warrior transition from hell, the devil may be an ambassador.
Depicted the destruction, but possibly also for those spoiled.
"Valhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
Office of Nuclear Energy IAEA has new warnings for the secret nuclear program in Syria.
Earth but prevents the expression of - and not allow inspections.
Around midnight on 5 to 6 September 2007 attack at least four Israeli fighter jets F-15 and the square mysterious building in Syria.
Euphratu on the shore, the nearest major town is 30 kilometers and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), its name appears when a reactor, which Syria reportedly built with North Korea in this square hidden in the valley which branches off from the mainstream.
The Communication of the US-American foreign secret service CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, threw well for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technique of the fifties on anything else suitable.
CIA presented a video nezaostřenými satellite imagery.
Using computer animation to clarify where the components of the reactor before the destruction could be to be a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, further submitted photographs which showed the building up close or even inside.
The reactor was apparently shortly before the start, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, no one knows much more than before, even puzzles even greater over time.
Earlier, U.S. President George W. Bush in his recently published memoirs that the CIA before the attack was very confident that Syria is building in el-Kibar reactor, but essentially no evidence that the country is "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some correspondents secret services in Europe are still cautious and merely refers to "the alleged reactor," even though the CIA presentation deemed "trustworthy."
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how he was sure that it was facing a reactor, said a diplomat in high summer, the UN, the IAEA has said "enough material to put questions."
Sut supposedly "unused military building" has been eliminated, while the Syrians quickly and properly align the terrain.
Still, we managed to find in June 2008, the IAEA team, led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received via a Member State of commercial satellite photos of sales period just after the attack, which should be more concise than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are on the market as an exclusive customer bought the unknown - perhaps Israel.
IAEA can not confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it had never been a secret nuclear program and the reactors nor place.
Uranium from Israeli weapons, has gone to Damascus.
But the IAEA refuted the analysis of particles.
Since then, Syria refuses to discuss the matter - as well as on satellite images.
In addition, disabled revizorům second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of bombed-out building.
But Israel stubbornly silent.
"We will never comment on 'official position was recently confirmed at the time the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case thus extends to no avail since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the office," as admitted by the High Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - it is still a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, to which the IAEA supervision.
IAEA considers key to move forward in case other three facilities to be "the functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike him, still exist.
While supervisors have not yet, nor that device is or what their function and why they are suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA referred to internally as Marj as-Sultan, and Masyaf Iskandariayah, derived again as nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identify these objects and photographs found on satellite building complex, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently located in or near military bases - for exactly this reason, Syria rejects IAEA's access to these three points.
In Vienna it was said that the Syrians are afraid of so-called fishing expedition - that would advance the IAEA sent the U.S. to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the U.S. secret service establishments.
IAEA has a background as well as satellite images, among them three points and the square at Euphratu transporting material to and fro.
In Vienna, large Western diplomat said that at least one device should be "in connection with the production of fuel.
But there is "no evidence of a hypersensitive activities, thus enriching uranium and processing of new, processes that are necessary for nuclear weapons.
Type of reactor is driven, while uranium is enriched.
But where the uranium came from and where it would later have to split plutonium into a bomb on the central questions is only a probability estimate.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important clues are kept in these three places.
Seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth's cost hundreds of trucks, nobody seems to have information on where to get the debris.
Only a few kilometers from the El Kibar, a remote and on the other hand, the salt mine located Euphratu al-so Tibni who had checked in Syria in 1998 as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste, IAEA considered unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in conjunction with the reactor in a single analysis of satellite images for a reputable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from space, but shows that after the IAEA requested access, Syria conducted on all suspected sites excavating and removing large containers.
It could be a coincidence, but it did not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, talks on diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months making plans for the auditors, which would allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - just the effort shows how big the interest of auditors.
Meanwhile Damascus rejected this proposal.
If a year ago he told Western diplomats in Vienna, it is still destroyed reactor, and therefore the thing does not burn, has been discussed for several months, U.S. Ambassador to Glyn Davies, a "special inspection, which is one of the hardest resources to the Vienna office to promote nuclear controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have control design, although no longer talked about "the possibility that in the future, I am inclined, but still hesitates.
This option offers a great risk: On the one hand, it needed to do most of the IAEA Board of Governor and many of the 35 countries represented definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as pointed out by one diplomat: "What happens when you finally find anything?"
Love in Time of War
Since that time, as Angelina Jolie began in the summer to work on the still nameless directorial debut, there is a problem.
She wrote the script, it is a love story of a woman and a man from Bosnia from Serbia.
Much more I do not know yet - but it causes anxiety.
He constantly speaks of the fact that the woman who is Muslim, falls in love during the war in Yugoslavia, the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, so they quickly moved the planned filming of Hungary in Sarajevo.
The film, meanwhile, finished filming in Hungary and is in post-production, in Bosnian but still protests.
Bakira Hasecic Organization of female war victims through the UN, wrote to organizations to assist refugees, UNHCR, Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now informed the Bosnian newspaper - also Jolie's ambassador to the UN-organizations to help refugees.
It's not diplomatic - to offer women weeks before the meeting in Hungary, but that they refused.
Meeting to be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps, where rape, the love stories take place and attitude towards the victims Jolie reveals a lot about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN-organization to help refugees, to release as Ambassador Jolie, informs Guardian.
What exactly wrote the scene Jolie?
Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read the script, authorized the minor wrangling in Sarajevo shooting - is not entirely clear why the Jolie did not come yet.
Young author points out that in his film does not pursue any political intentions, that with great efforts devoted to the conflict in Yugoslavia, he wants to show the terrible consequences of war and all interested parties to make room.
Since the content remains uncertain.
Circulating on the Internet is another version of the film, which is really quite different: lovers already knew before the war and they met again when she is a Bosnian Muslim, Serb introduced into the camp, where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a lot different than "rape victim falling in love with her tormentor.
The fact that the film Jolie really begins even before the war - is true.
Jolie claims that it is under pressure to "not fair and based on false information."
Now she can no longer deliver the hekeři Hollywood: By illegally published on the internet the script, as it has done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening it is once again good for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominated too much of his guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans are screaming with joy to the sound of loud music, clump down.

Still seeking 26-year-old man have fun, relax from the vexing question of what the future holds.
His plan is not a passion play in Las Vegas, going to an interview in January in New Zealand.
"It makes me a terrible feeling," he says.

His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as IT consultant in London.
Boys going: As it looks at Tanner in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people leave the country for the foreseeable future, experts predict the Scientific Institute of Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin ESRI.
Count even in 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants it is a major loss.
If the prediction is confirmed, there is a similar wave of expatriation, which endured Ireland in the eighties.
After decades of increase, which has a large Irish prosperity, is now widening again neutěšenost.
Economic crisis znejišťuje primarily young, educated Irish who has just experienced an upswing.
Loss of employment and social descent seemed in those boom years of the absurd.
The need was all, money was tight.
Meanwhile, but three out of ten women and men in thirty years of work.
The Irish Times, many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers - but who can, he comes off the ground and we lost an entire generation."
"Last, please let go off."
Student Rights Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future of black, because the government says only deceiving young people and offer no prospects for the future.
"Reduces the minimum wage, they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-old.
She watches as her classmates pretty dizzy from one practitioner to another unpaid.
Her biggest concern is that it will have four years to move out myself.
"This idea is a sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon trying to see the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a complete service on working abroad.
"For starters, the labor market is working abroad did an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On its web site are pictures of surfers in Australia and skiing and snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not the galley, but the freedom and joy.
About what it is to build something somewhere else, you know half of Sean O'Donovan.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, is now engaged, together with 15 colleagues in the Irish construction in Germany.
Just put in Gelsenkirchen fashion house.
In January, continues to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because she works extra shifts in order to repay the home loan on the house.
"The situation is really a little crazy sometimes," he says, when the first time in a long time exceeds the threshold of their house.
"I make money in Germany at a house in Ireland, where in fact not at all."
He laughs awkwardly and walk vychladlými rooms.
Little House is in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, a large park in the drive expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought a house together with her sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100-percent financed loan.
"It was a crazy time, money was easy without too many questions," he says.
She worries that it might not turn out well with a loan?
O'Donovan thinks a moment, down the hot tea and says: "I have kids that I had to feed and I was young, even when things go wrong, I can start again."
Construction engineer does not like wailing, now so often hear.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation is still not a bit as dramatic as ever on this island," he says.
"While working abroad, it is not the worst thing that could happen - maybe then we'll feel just like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who retired in the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years, was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
To have an open future and just wait and see how it will develop life elsewhere.
He has been several years working in London and why should not it be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend, also a good idea?
There is but one more thing that these days he worries enough: a celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They fear that could go wrong na farewell celebration.
"Just no emotion," he says and drink a good beer.
"Good, that does sound alarming."
"Call it a celebration does go, quite simply, with a few friends, few drinks, a few games."
The common practice of democracy
Promoting Democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as promotion of private entrepreneurship.
Crime raises more concern than unemployment.
And many regions of Brazil, considered more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of a survey Latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey is held periodically since 1995 to track the changes in attitudes across the whole area.
In this survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America is quite cheerful.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Promoting democracy in several countries on the Pacific side of South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where since 2002, economic growth averaged 6% per annum, increased support for democracy from the minimum 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also increased in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are convinced democrats, which downloads the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents across all areas expressed satisfaction with the way their democracy works in country practice, it is the same number as last year, but compared with 2001, when it was 25% for the large increase (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trust Congress in their country and 45% trust the government again is about the same number as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, has undermined democracy in Latin American economic crisis.
Support was established during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net to help protect poor people.
(Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and this year it fell again to 32%.)
But the mood changes in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
Strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and deteriorated state of violent crime.
It was only the second time since it began to conduct surveys, more respondents see throughout Latin America as the most important crime problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Around 31% said that either they or their close relatives happened last year to victims of crime, but it is a decrease compared with the figure of 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private enterprise and market economy: around 71% of respondents across all regions said that private enterprise is essential for development, this percentage rose from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that allows the development of their country, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela has the same view (and 80% there support a private business), although their left-wing President Hugo Chavez has many expropriating private companies.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the field, as mentioned by the respondents 19% (vs. 18% last year), followed by the United States (9% compared to last year, unchanged) and Venezuela (9% vs. 11% last year)
However, the United States is regarded as the most influential country of the respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela is enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Contested election
Nobody expected that it will be general elections in Haiti 28 November is perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the affected country to be feared.
Elections meant filling se urn and repeated voting, ballot papers scattered along the canals, broken polling and intimidation.
Polling station open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many exiles because of the January earthquake, roamed around and tried to figure out where they can go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several expected forerunners shouting that this is a fraud and called for the annulment of elections.
Protests, some violent, have spread across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti said that "in many respects was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that "does not believe that these discrepancies, though whether they were serious, not necessarily cancel the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, the opposition voices are bound by René Préval, unpopular outgoing president and his nominee Jude Celestine, is to announce interim results on 7 December.
The expected final battle is scheduled for January.
All hope is not lost the election.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martell, rapper and Mirland Manigat, former First Lady, resigned from his original challenge to the vote declared invalid.
The problem may occur if Mr. Celestine, who has little or negligible support among voters, the electoral commission indicated that it has reached a decisive battle.
Due to the rampaging epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people after the earthquake are still living in tents, there were fears that the turnout will be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization in that they have been prevented.
Approximately 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, shortly before the elections remain undivided.
At stake is a lot.
Donors see the election legitimate and popular government as a vital step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that it is the Haitians themselves implants.
After a peak in the center
In a week when suddenly widowed, benefits Cristina Fernández, Argentine president, public sympathy when her popularity strengthened from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Despite this success in reversal of a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fernandez intransigence renounces her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner's political partner.
And these characters, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued the economic policies even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of budgeting, which underestimated the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernandez lost government last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and has been further destabilized the death of Mr. Kirchner's attack on the 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement to add to Mrs. Fernandez.
But after a chaotic meetings (where there were slaps and accusations of government corruption), Congress failed to approve the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, the president will have more room to spend at will.
The economy is excessively hot: This year is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speaking, a figure which is close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina distressed economic collapse, setting priorities on growth and poverty reduction, rather than on controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdening the private sector and cleanse Indeco, the statistical agency agreed to monitor the official inflation statistics.
It can now President Fernandez moderate America this policy?
It called for negotiations between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want next year to limit wage increases to 18%.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But the disturbing growth of inflation based on a large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why Ms. Fernandez gives the president know that he wants to restore the Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year the government established an agreement with bondholders, who earlier refused to restructure debt that Argentina has not paid in 2001.
Now, Mrs. President Fernandez is facing an agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris club, which owes about $ 6,700,000,000.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact was not within sight of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Bouda, Minister of Economy announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-price index, which will commemorate the introduction of clean INDECO.
It is not clear whether Mrs. President Fernandez will want to stay in politics after his term of office, when he husband was not at her side.
If you want to stay, he needs to gain support from the middle class that is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the return of the Argentine summer holidays, which are in March, a wave of sympathy will decline.
If you want to win the next election, will have to decide whether it will be quietly let go of many ideas which her husband held in politics.
Half boost for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to closer links with the mainland.
What do you think of Taiwan, its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the legitimate, elected on 27 November the Mayor and City Council in the five urban districts, which can be regarded as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
The president alone has the representative of the feelings that dominate the mainland and are strongly embedded in business relations, including agreements on the part of free trade in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five offices of mayor, failed to win majority votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of the vote against 45% by the KMT.
If this were a presidential election, should the president has the problem.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of votes of his party fell by about 8%.
For the first time the DPP party, together with the KMT in local councils.
Elections are taking place as most Taiwanese elections, including election noisy trucks and mass gatherings with flags that show scantily clad girls.
The mystery was even obliged to attempt an assassination.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, KMT honorary chairman, was lobbying for the KMT candidates on the eve of elections.
The man in the crowd shot of a young Mr Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing the audience.
Bizarrely not been determined whether the gunman had intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In each case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, said that the shooting affected the election, suspicion falls on DPP voters and leads towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner was China campaign.
It was noteworthy that remained in sight of land itself.
Instead, candidates wrestled on the plans to the state housing and job creation.
Taiwan, they usually used their de facto independence, and hates the military threat of China.
The KMT has therefore tended to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP dropped from pushing the anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to reality and realize that China's trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma for his party confirmed that the policy of China is Taiwan's most acceptable.
Since the government in Beijing can be expected to continue in commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has wasted no time in sending negotiators to Taipei to arrange summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Sure would also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It would be better to wait until after the presidential election in 2012.
DPP party, in any case found itself.
Two years ago, was on the wrong level: the former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
President in 2000-08 and was a rebel supporter of independence clear.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai has developed a new generation that is moderate and DPP working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was chanting as the DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything they can to show that it can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans for research institutes, which serve as the focal point between the DPP and China, provided that their actions can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai Taiwan tells the public that her party is a "credible alternative" to a hasty approach to China, Mr Ma.
Mr. Chen seems to be angered by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell to express the view that the DPP candidates would have fared better had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatist, that stands as a candidate for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr Chen's DPP will compete for selection among potential candidates.
The KMT is entitled to seek its own people.
Reviews of Mr Ma were poor, despite the breakneck pace of economic growth, KMT candidates did not want him to go into the campaign.
His unpopularity appears to be primarily based on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
KMT spokesman said that the reshuffle his cabinet, as well as local affiliates.
Heavily promoted proposals to encourage Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time is considered by most Taiwanese citizens' economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent journalist, "point of no return has already passed."

The planned mosque in the Temecula Planning Commission approval received
The planned mosque in Temecula won the unanimous support of the local planning commission for more than five hours of often impassioned public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism, and will lead to suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and be aesthetically pleasing.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you remember," said Nael Hadi, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I set this as a very proud American citizen."
"Indicates that justice always prevails."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against, just shout out loud."
"We have in our valley really good people."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time taken up by discussions with people who were for or against the Centre. These votes are evenly divided, shows the Press-Enterprise.
Discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no longer America," appeared in one comment.
"We the Planet of the Apes Statue of Liberty go into the sand."
"America has fallen."
Islamic Center Planned sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, site of tragedy, which is held on 11 September 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
The Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community numbering some 135 families in Riverside County, plagued for years without incident, but wanted a bigger and better space than the storage space that you rented together with the manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new mosque, measuring 24,943 square foot Mediterranean-style architecture will also have two minarets and grow to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of ​​4.32 acres Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents are still on the project can still appeal to the City Council.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increases the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth, arguing that it is a sign that life has possibilities that are outside the main elements that were previously considered and essential.
"This organism has the dual capability."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is very strange, but it is not proof that it is actually a form of 'alien' life," commented on this fact, Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
Has long been considered essential to the lives of six key elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
Scientists, however, found that bacteria detected in Mono Lake in California are able to continue to grow after the arsenic was replaced by phosphorus.
"He starts to amaze you, what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life may seem, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, this news report published to and discussed to divulge details of the finding sparked wide speculation on the Internet, the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
Not so.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other drivers for the biochemistry and the set of elements that we consider to be 'standard' may not be for life so absolutely necessary," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another element in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It was not an unexpected finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of Astrobiologického Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake, because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so consider that a microbe that is exposed to both elements, may be able to substitute one for another.
"Arsenic is toxic, mainly because of its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can be very difficult these elements separate from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that it does not work as well as phosphorus. When he gets into the body, begins to work in biochemical processes," said Anbar.
The researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exhibit the increasing concentration of arsenic, bacteria that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but given that they can survive the replacement of arsenic increases the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of ​​arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but never found an example on which to prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists have speculated that it could benefit from earlier life forms.
"This suggests that it could be other ways to create life, not just the way they created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the research team, Wolfe-Simon.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health
The remaining dogs were stolen, found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that were stolen from a motel Bellflower, were found. Reported the sheriff of Los Angeles on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas velští pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where they spent the night at Motel 6 Bellflower, authorities informed.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and then the other two dogs late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the police department of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found in what location, as well as to share some details about their find.
"The investigation continues."
"We do not talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We adhere to the rules."
Owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to be able to comment on the case.
We are very happy while on Wednesday afternoon, their two Akitas found in a shelter in Downey.
Sheriff agents found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akita Trace, Trace-year male and 10 female monthly Didi were no injuries, authorities informed.
But Bunny and Peter, breeds Pembroke Welsh Corgi Rickard and Peek, who had planned this week to participate in regional competitions on behalf of its Japanese owners, remained never found until the discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach where they planned to show the Trace.
Other dogs have to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the show AKC / Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop for almost a month after traveling a couple of dog shows.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard signed up to the motel.
Often they sleep in motels and park your car outside the window room.
They took with them the three dogs - a boxer puppy, Jack Russell terrier and hound Breton - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, which should be cooler.
Opened her little window in the car had a dog plenty of fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6am on Tuesday.
Peek said he offers a reward to anyone who is to introduce zmizelým dogs. Dogs have a microchip implanted for identification.
On Thursday it was unclear whether they will be awarded prizes.
The lion is ready to roar again, now that the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally given green light to begin again.
Federal Bankruptcy Judge of New York on Thursday officially blessed "pre zabalenému 'creditors plan to settle about 5 billion dollars of debt and cleanse the way for 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on production and production of films and television shows.
Thursday's decree, it meets the requirements of Bankruptcy Procedure, the U.S. does not leave the MGM no legal obstacles that could reignite the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders zeštíhleného study.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 of more than 400 original
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until the JPMorgan Chase has agreed to the planned financial resources with a loan of 500 million dollars to zafinancovaly new operations and production of MGM.
Now it is the connection with the investment bank, which itself needs 75 million U.S. dollars and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of study began in May 2009, when it was hired investment bank Moelis & Co.. To advise management how to solve their money because management had fought so that he could afford the interest payments of 300 million dollars annually.
This August, President Harry Sloan replace Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and expert on sales, known for their work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM studios and 140 creditors, took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agree that at the end of 2009 put the company up for sale.
Although the auction attracted several candidates, none were willing to pay $ 2,000,000,000 plus the finance requested by creditors.
In the spring, everything was back to the drawing board, and the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan. After months of debating and internal disputes plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM in the coming weeks officially rise from bankruptcy, Moelis and Company Cooper for his work received a multimillion-dollar bonuses in dollars.
Moelis & Co. company. Which has received $ 1,200,000, will receive payment of $ 9,500,000.
Cooper's firm, which collects a fee for their services, which manages run the company $ 375,000 per month will receive a reward for success, a "success fee" $ 4,000,000.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, which this year released only one movie and put together a proposal for seven or eight movies that come out early 2012.
It also plans to participate in the financing of the two films, the draft of the book "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros..
Studies need to negotiate a separate loan between 265 million and 275 million U.S. dollars to zafinancovalo its share of those two movies that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of the debts of MGM studios looking for the possibility of merging with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies resulted in an agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your budget on gifts in the balance
Leading candidate for this year is the coolest toy iPad, followed by a videogame system. In both cases, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that in one case, declared a price you can buy a pet BMX bike for $ 99 and one game Kinect costs the same as 10 beaded skipping ropes or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget in balance for gifts.
I recently visited three national toy retailer - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched as the electronic toys you can buy for less than $ 80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law works, this technological toys are far more energy, and at the same price, if not slightly lower compared with previous years.
While it appeared relatively fewer new sites associated with the toys, the best known of this type of toy, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
An increasing number of toys knoflíkovými batteries, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices shown are from Toys "R" Us, except those marked otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their tummy.
In one tone pet pressing issues and second press will create a song.
If you buy more than one, and they sing together in harmony.
Note: When you squeeze, you can not stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing star Mickey's Dance (Fisher-Price, $ 60, from 2 years)
Last year I put on Elmo Live technology borrowed animatrickou 14 inch doll that can play a game of Simon Says, and can also be a monthly walk through its innovative folding leg with locking wheels.
Children test a toy Mickey dance instructor, even though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child 80th years, maybe you remember to Alphie, one of the first educational computer toys.
He's Back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40 for children 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards, which are designed to drive the car turned into a pleasure working with self-healing, humorous workbook.
If pošilháváte a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($ 60 for children 3 to 8 years old) it is the cheapest option with ease of use with a QWERTY keyboard, though the games are not as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($ 70 for children 3 to 12 years), the first major change range from LeapFrog Leapster, with a newer and brighter display.
Neither version is not compatible with older units.
IXL Fisher-Price ($ 90 for children 3 to 7 years old) system uses iTunes-like introduction to games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro, for children 8 years old) is a set of five dice, no larger than a pack of matches, each of which has an LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing blocks in a series before time runs out, it's great to compete in improvised word formation.
More and more toys have at least some sort of online connection.
Maximising were represented by two toy toy Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want your child to buy online toy from club penguin, you can choose for example, Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $ 5 for children 6 to 12 years), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin shop store for any two items.
This could include the need roller skates or pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than the bristles of your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano ($ 10 for children 5 years old), the latest of a series mikrorobotů the button battery.
The Beetle is moving quickly to 12 feet of vibrating silicon in random directions.
It's funny when you make a maze of bars and watch if he can find a way out.
It is also very durable.
The U.S. was able to drop the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
The introduction of finer policing in China
As a military instructor in town, walked around the square Shenbin Tang strictly controlled and issued orders to his low voice commands with military authority.
He wanted the female members - Chinese state vymahatelky urban policy, feared and despised for his crackdowns and a penchant for violence - to provide an impression on the crowd of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry!"
Show them, whispering softly, "look how pretty girls!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive oil coats and pants stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to a ruler.
Four headgear fits perfectly on your hair, which are perfectly tied blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr Tang said dismissively.
"The models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of Supervisors in urban China.
One city has ordered that new recruits have a college education.
Guangdong Province turned gray-green uniforms allegedly attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China replaced the stares as strong weapons: in 2009, one report stated that 50 officers surrounded the truck with snacks firmly and intently watched the owner until the peddler after half an hour, packed up and left.
Xindu, urban district with 680,000 residents in Chengdu for the main image selected operation.
Since 2003 he added to his district of the city police on 13 women who were specifically selected according to their appearance, symmetry, and a young age.
The aim is to show the site in addition to gross police also softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, very Scarlett Johansson would be able to get into the secret of Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue with good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinance, impose administrative fines and other penalties.
But the Chinese media usually depict a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in the province of Hubei utloukli bystander to death after used his cellphone to shoot, how to begin the procedure in the case of protest against the landfill.
Last year police training took place in Beijing, the training manual was stolen and posted online. The manual was also a description of how to effectively beat the offender with no signs of blood.
This year came a peddler with melons in Shanghai into a fight with five police officers suffered injuries and left brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows the Chinese police to attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan startled the government," China Daily, a national issue, lamented last year after further discussion on tactics.
On paper became "very thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised in October, interest in women's eight new police officers, editorial in The Beijing Evening News report addressing the question of whether women have a real obligation or merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
District requested female candidates aged 18 to 22 years with good character and "the five facial features in correct proportion."
Adepts should be at a higher than average - that is higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officials say that work is too physically demanding for women over 25 years.
"Their image is the important thing," said an unnamed policeman Rednet.com, if the government web site.
"Female candidates must first demonstrate to external quality, which then determine the other, they include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "inner quality."
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition, the vases are, they also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihui, deputy director of management of the metropolis, this description does not match the power.
But observing that the height requirements are common in China for other jobs, and in both sexes.
As demand for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the question of good appearance is subject to debate among Chinese.
Disability or mutilation is certainly inappropriate.
"It can not be allowed to serve in our lame or hunchback," said Zheng.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a vigil on the square near the monastery Baoguang, has 22 years, faces like apples and finely shaped mouth.
It does not appear to focus on her appearance could be sexist character, she said.
"Do you think that the uniforms look sexy?" she asked with a wry look.
Dolíčkama with her colleagues, the 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They have no objection to its limited power, he said, because their career ambitions are larger than simply drive away the traders in the streets, where they can operate.
Every morning is a group to more than ten trhovcům who run around on foot or bicycle and trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu dishes before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang to leave."
"We've told you many times!" Ms. Xu said, when he began to run marketeer, and the time he left his bike with a cart with noodles.
Police describe their duties as more strenuous than monotonous.
"Every day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in his spare time marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that the female police officer have the powers as their male counterparts in order to seize goods retailers.
They only threatened to report the fact to their male supervisor.
The tendency is then to protect the public from sudden hostilities against the official machinery, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of people in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after false rumors spread that police officers were killed by the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night, 14 government vehicles were overturned and burned.
Xindu so far escaped such violence.
But peace can be guaranteed only with difficulty.
Only two blocks from a quiet square Baoguang, where the blow had a patrol cop on the corner, gathering more than 50 people.
The police seized a motorcycle that is repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop, as required by law.
Owner round as he wanted to cry.
15 minute distance from the police, tvářící angrily, with his elbows against vehicles and fast off the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the affiliated group of men, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
As well as being a female police officer, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, are trained in maintenance and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said soberly.
"Mostly it's the public that with the start."
Prosecutors do not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors Ministry of Justice purified by Senator John Ensign of criminal charges, which related to his affair with former campaign aide and his efforts to ensure the lobby, told lawyers on Wednesday, Senator.
Decision ending the most serious legal threat to Mr. Ensign, Nevada Republican, faced and that was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for president in 2012. The affair got into the national headlines and damaged his career.
The Office of Mr. Ensign said that was a decision that followed nearly a year of investigations, "certainly pleased."
Senators would still have to face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate ethics committee.
Lawyers Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice "informed us that Senator Ensign will not order an investigation and that it plans to float against other defendants in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who argued that there is clear evidence that Mr. Ensign prepared violations of the federal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to ensure a lucrative lobby, which should lead to silence, Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, senators on the relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton had once worked as a cashier in a campaign Ensign.
Mr. Ensign had contacted a number of political supporters, to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their opinions after Mr Hampton employed to lobby for them, so many state documents and interviews.
Because Hampton was until recently an assistant to Mr. Ensign was the law from lobbying his former employer for the Senate or eliminated.
Ethics experts say that the unusual settlement Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the scandal, appeared inconsistent with the prohibition on lobbying.
The evidence has been published "it became clear that this is a clear case of violation of preparation," said Stanley Brand, the Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics, said that the ministry is cautious in terms of political actions, after a large number of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend action against the former senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of prosecution misconduct.
Federal prosecutor "clearly hiding weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a group of lawyers who filed the case in a number of complaints against Mr. Ensign.
"It's basically the fact that senior government officials apply the law," she said.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had on Monday called a state representative from the Ministry of Justice and then the next day and told him that the Department did not find his client against any accusations.
Mr. Ensign Advocacy Team works with the applicants in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments passed to prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to stop investigating a separate complaint, the ethics group that made the accusation that their parents of Ensign Hamptonům payment of $ 96,000 violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing else than the present.
One company, for which Mr. Ensign had helped to find Mr. Hampton lobbying work, the company NV Energy, the main Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail in December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started the company to act as a lobbyist, chief of staff of Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - to communicate with Mr. Hampton and told him that "hammered" by the Ministry of Interior on the subject being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and other nevadským client, Allegiant Air and transport minister called to an appointment on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton to hire a lobbying job.
When he first appeared on last year's report on the affair, Mr. Ensign has apologized to voters and resigned from his position as a fourth of the Republican leaders in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign had two weeks ago, told reporters that plans to participate in the third term in the Senate.
The report that Mr. Ensign no longer order a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the Ethics Commission will be quickly followed by the Ministry of Justice and terminate the whole investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," said Dale.
Call Cheshire village are turning to Twitter
The ranks of the courtroom a half dozen of them wrote.
One minute after minute, sending reports of horrendous testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140 000 messages on Twitter dealt with rape and tethering to the beds of children in the house, which was ignited.
On Thursday, the hearing was held by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Conn., family, and had held the official end to the imposition of the death penalty, the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely employ years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting process - including the widespread use of Twitter's main reporter - created a "circus atmosphere" and that widespread, direct infiltration of inflammatory details of the information, then introduced a panel for a decision within the meaning of influencing public opinion.
This assertion might compel a judge to address the question whether the advent of new technologies do not require a new rule in the courtroom.
"What I experienced at this hearing, I think there is a real risk that the integration of new technologies in the courtroom as affecting the rights of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the process, Jon C. Blue State Supreme Court briefly rejected the claim on the proceeds from last week and the fact that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence which would suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts recognize that the reporting of notorious cases may raise questions about justice process.
In the court of the 1966 United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, which, in its decision said that in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, is in the process because the media was a "carnival atmosphere" .
Some believe that this crime has inspired a TV show and movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts to review Hayesův Case for half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that it might be necessary for new rules that specify how to communicate the direction of the courtroom, which was where Dr. Sheppard was unimaginable.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" in high profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, Professor of Law Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report which said that it was exercised arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be impressed by the idea that restrictions on direct communication in the direction of the courtroom can make the process fairer.
The Case of Twitter is just one of many outlined by Mr Hayes' lawyers, who can argue the years to refrain from carrying out above.
Proponents also argue for example that if Mr. Hayes could be a bias when the judge refused to allow him the Blue test the reaction of potential jurors by giving them the choice of a criminal jury shown pictures awesome.
Some jurors said they were appalled by photos of victims, which became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11
Proponents argue that it also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed juror, who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision was wrong put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to the weekend thinking.
Jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the extent of the impact process can attract the most interest.
They stated in the objection raised by the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign, candidates for governor and United States Senate.
They argued that the media continually fan the flames in the flames of emotion on this case.
"The daily rush of media cameras and reporters before the court," wrote the lawyer, "was something here in New Haven has yet to be seen and is possibly a national curiosity."
Their focus on the activities of Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later reports from the perspective of the judicial police should follow the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers have requested appellate courts often used the argument that social and technological changes require adjustment of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers seeking the right.
In its archives referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 concerning the appeal of Dr. Sheppard, the breadth of activity due process and would clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," he wrote, "is a case of Sheppard v. Maxwell 21st century."
Politeness can bridge the gap?
After a campaign that was notable for its negativity and petulance, this week in Washington, found a small amount of politeness.
It is the first swallow genuine cooperation of the two political parties, or just illusionary moment before quickly returning to partisan fighting in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders yielded no breakthroughs on key issues to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a polite discussion dealing with the ideological difference between the two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another episode empty partisan struggles.
Wednesday's public session of the Commission President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems that it is clear that a close cooperation for several months, built a mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological chasm that still divides the members.
And it is quite difficult to argue that a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in the test period - each probe mark of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the boundaries between public opinion and voter patience to re-partisan war.
Therefore, it was a Tuesday hearing and the subsequent evaluation of the participants carried out with the minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to make the proposed rapid change in circumstances that are prevailing the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, spending, health care and rights, the two sides are miles away.
However, the November election prepared by Washington, at least quickly.
"It is questionable whether changing regulatory issues," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
Options pump up the emotions of those party members and then stopped.
It's good. "
In several issues, including those to discuss at the meeting, Democrats and Republicans have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year had expired, and no one was not considered favorable.
Both parties want to find a way to protect some or all of them permanently or temporarily.
Just as likely to compromise on unemployment benefits solely because the Republicans can not look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while refusing to support the unemployed in the unemployment rate.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House has shown greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new contract starting.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on substantive issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties, when the 112th Congress convened in January.
Rather, the disagreement is likely, even inevitable, he said.
"After they do the things that has to do with psychology in the short run back to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is greatly expanded - that courtesy will be real cooperation.
"I look at all that happens between now and 2012 as shadow boxing, when major events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of the new Republican majority in the White House, tea parties and voters who have helped create.
Republican leaders are now facing the danger of exaggerating, they know that they must behave according to their promises and must reduce government spending and to repeal a new law on health care.
These are clear partisan lines in the initial response to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reforming the tax code and increase some taxes, raise the retirement age and reducing costs.
Joint Chairmen Alan Simpson, and Erskine Bowles took to task one of the toughest challenges in Washington and have, in his view, to put pressure on the deficit issue a public program in ways that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission, in order to present his plan as an official recommendation and then fought to make this number as much as possible approached.
The biggest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, who suggested that if the financial issues we have now at least, small foundations, or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of partisan conflict, the Republicans invite Obama to tackle budget, taxes and health care, which will be followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship in the last election, most Americans still want to see two sides to work together.
If you could go to a stalemate, as it was in 1995, then both sides will very closely monitor public reaction.
To anyone threatening to reduce the votes are likely to change course and will seek a compromise.
This may be an optimistic view of things.
Partisanship and orientation are greater today than it was in the mid-nineties, it appears that create more ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than was the case with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
Same time, activists on both sides sees 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, civility, which appeared this week, many Americans would welcome.
It will happen but a lot of efforts on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
U.S. Disclosure Document describes Moscow as a haven of corruption
Management is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues to parts of bribes and kickbacks for the protection that comes through in the Kremlin, reported the U.S. Embassy in Russia on record in February.
The police and Federal Security Service to a large extent, holds wing, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
Collect money not only from legal trade, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical authority" - I take my when money starts to move up the ladder.
Record, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrleho was published on Wednesday by WikiLeaks on their web site.
Record is based on sources whose names were redacted.
The record was written while he was still mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since we can observe only minimal changes in the cleanup.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, after many years of continually denied allegations of corruption, and won several libel actions for such allegations.
In September, told a Russian television station, when asked the proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it turns out to vote.
But it is unusual to meet with such details vyřčenými manner, in ambasádní report, and is also unheard of so do diplomats from foreign countries.
"The city government of Moscow and its links with criminal elements have led some to be called 'dysfunctional' and confirm that the government acts more like a kleptocracy than a government," the report said.
"Criminal elements are enjoying the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of jail and the Mafia, which literally means 'top' or protection) granted by the police, the Federal Security Service, Federal Security Service (FSB), Interior Ministry and the Office of the State representatives, as well as everywhere else in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-stage structure of the criminal world in Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and the militia are in second grade."
"And finally, the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It's inefficient system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in certain areas, as the city does not provide any services."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on small businesses.
One source said the "owners of shops in Moscow are aware that it is better to get protection from the Interior Ministry and FSB (rather than by organized criminal groups), not only because more weapons, resources and power than a criminal group, but are also protected by law. "
"For this reason, no protection from criminal gangs is not so in the course."
Record says that while withdrawing money is complex, it can protect itself have trouble i tell you what, it may sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay enough, their shops closed on various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times on the fight against corruption, but admitted that he made little progress.
Ambasádní report talks about men marrying cases, probably bulging cash in the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview with Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's research team elsewhere.
"But part of the bureaucracy."
"It is part of the political class, because Russia's political class already exists."
No politicians, no opposition, no separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indian estimates that corruption costs nationally Russia more than $ 300 billion annually.
The country ranks 154th place in a recent global survey on perceptions of corruption NGO Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to the most corrupt).
Disclosure reports the American Embassy in Moscow which appeared until late in the evening certainly evoked the enthusiasm of the Russian government, though only to the extent that, in Moscow's shortcomings might be accused Luzhkov, a Kremlin to be able to argue the case in problem solving .
In a CNN interview with Larry King told Putin that the documents posted to WikiLeaks to be forgeries, and reacted angrily to a statement that he called U.S. diplomats Medvedev Batman and Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that the terms of our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we did not feel that this will be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, understand and unethical."
Khmer Rouge veterans are forced to deal with the past
In the dimly lit concrete classroom with soiled walls and peeled reminded headmaster Anlong Veng High School, the man who built it, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody loves The Moka."
"It was a good leader, and cared for his people," said Cor Sreng Ma, 42
Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge remains the commander in the distant possessions of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia's northwestern popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where he still lives thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered government is battered in the long-standing loyalty Anlong Venga.
In April, the victims of the truth and reconciliation forum allowed the public to confront the people who were part of the scheme.
In June the government provided a textbook that explains the history of the first children of the Khmer Rouge and former soldiers.
And in July to raise together the UN and the Cambodian court of first conviction of former Khmer Rouge member, a conviction of the former leader, the notorious Tuol Sleng violent associations, Kaing Khek IEV, better known as Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these advances, unrest grew among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates the reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-integrate into Cambodian society.
"The former Khmer Rouge is hatred and fear, but are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youku, head Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life was wonderful between the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"Starting a family."
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, remnants of the regime and his troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There began the rebellion, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary, and guerrilla war driven from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok while cultivating supporters in Anlong Venga.
But in the mid-nineties, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was headed to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters have begun moving on to the government, which culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who has endured, in 1999, was captured by government forces nedalých Dangrek mountains.
He died in Phnom Penhském prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons have had not cared about them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into the common Cambodian rural life and many of them reminisces about the time of the movement.
While a few elite Khmer Rouge retained their local government's position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people should surrender of little benefit," said Sok Leang the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which results in public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Venga.
"They are surrounded by an agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were brought up without any idea of ​​executing a transaction."
Lim Sor, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungles around Anlong Venga before he settled down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok all living."
"But now, life is hard, because everything we have to ensure ourselves."
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge has also sparked concern.
Early next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute Leaders and the people responsible for crimes, but did not say whether it will continue also in the four cases.
It was just a little, calming fears in Anlong Venga.
Recent media speculation focused on IM Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the late seventies.
In 2007, said researchers from the Documentation Center of Cambodia, that oversaw the construction of dams Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed one thousand forced laborers.
Recent steam evening Im Chae returned from field work in her wooden house on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and the shadows appear across the parched grass, Im Chae refused to talk about his past, the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she refused to go.
"In Cambodia, the government's peace and stability," she said.
"If they discover further criminal prosecution will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability occurs when the court will look for other suspects, though, with experts and historians agree.
"Cambodia has to dig a deep hole and bury it in the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, "said Chhang Youku the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in khmerským ratio means gluing broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put the broken pieces together, we can understand."
Center issued the first textbook approved by the Government of the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Kampuchea."
It was distributed in Anlong Venga in June as a supplement to the textbook history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages of the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Venga knew few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the concentration of the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at a secondary school in Anlong Veng said that the new textbook to help students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family refuses to many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are unsure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance is a process of reconciliation complex and difficult, "said Sok Leang.
But public forums, books, and begin to affect the court, said further.
The Khmer Rouge are still have strong appeal.
Up in the mountains Dangrek Mountains path is overgrown with weeds and poured discarded plastic bags, which led to the rectangle of black soot, covered with rusty tin roofs.
The body of Pol Pot was cremated here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, saleswoman mobiles on the roadside said they did not know much about the man who was cremated on the spot.
"But it has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea birthday and had planned to later visit the resting place of Pol Pot, which will bundle ripe bananas in the hope that it brings her luck.
Belarus agrees to appear on their stocks of weapons based on uranium
In a surprise victory in the Obama campaign on securing nuclear materials worldwide, announced today the Belarusian government on Wednesday, giving up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after the summit, security minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has for years sought to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to hit a stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post reported that in the past two months Belarus has been carried out with a couple of classified operation to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium research facilities in Belarus.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the debris - about 500 pounds, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are sensitive.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in April, to which Belarus has been eliminated.
And he was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic in the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want to place on the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement as "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, ensuring that all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government to help the six countries to get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Summit on Nuclear Safety, said Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko that his nation will never give up its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds of what is essentially the basis for the gun and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said after.
"It is our commodity ... We do not intend to manufacture a dirty bomb and also it is not going to sell anybody."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, several months ago, joined the United States and could show interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment of Belarus to remove uranium in October, has been particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train, which traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian facility for the storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was taken by air, officials said.
U.S. government for the program spent $ 13 million, most of it on the delivery of the Belarusian Research Institute of less enriched uranium for nuclear weapons fit.
"Everything was very carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official working for the DOE Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the Study of the NPT this year estimated that Belarus is at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
Belarus will, under the Joint Declaration, aiming to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome the progress in the global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that the consistent observance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improved relations and it is necessary for the advancement of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not do with the CIA flights coy
The Spanish government did not make coy about CIA flights transporting imprisoned Taliban and al-Qaeda members in Guantanamo over the Spanish territory, as expressed in his telegram to the United States ambassador in Madrid.
Thus it is clear from the documents provided by the server Wikileaks newspaper El País, where he also writes that the former deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega asked to be informed and the Spanish executive "could be shown that the proper oversight of foreign aircraft streaking Spanish airspace.
In June 2006, following communication from the Council of Europe, which has been accused of a dozen states, including Spain's complicity in the violation of human rights, a meeting between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
Deputy Prime Minister said that the Communication Council of Europe, "Zapatero government has excluded from the game" and insisted that Spain does not matter nothing to hide.
De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no problem with intelligence flights over its territory.
"We simply want to be just informed" that were "unprepared to be reached," Aguirre tells one of them.
Also, former Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos to the U.S. ambassador, the Spanish government "wanted to give this issue the lowest possible outlines, but that the matter was in the hands of judges, Cabinet had limited influence."
In February 2007 Attorney General Vicente Gonzalez told the Embassy that if his concerns do not intend to block the initiative to seek the declassification of documents, a judge of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These do not contain any ingredients of the incriminated or any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the U.S. expressed concern for more "overt coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors' disclosure of information rather than because of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"The coordination between the independent experts will complicate our efforts to solve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, lunch on the occasion of the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, told the ambassadors that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they deem fit," Instructions have already entered their colleagues, "let avoid rousing comments with the intent to reduce tension. "
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP Czech People's Party - ed. Acknowledges the.) In this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the party Partido Popular would not hesitate to use any suggestion that the Zapatero government has deliberately ignored or tolerated the U.S. negotiations, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States, "he notes.
Accorded to the mother-murderer complained to the parent network "worry"
The young woman spoke about the child when he was dead, and had his blog: "Terror on galicijsku"
Mónica Fernández Juanateyová on the Internet called "Muki."
with the nickname he used from childhood, to communicate with his cousin and at least one friend, both of them are from the village of Noia La Coruna, in which a young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
So that they can understand, you need to know the woman's emotional life, which reconstructs the daily ABC with the testimony of family members.
Thirty women from Galicia in 1998 entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Tunez.
They went together one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know whether the newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let do DNA tests.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
It was chosen by Alberto, a young man from the nearby town Lousame.
Their co-existence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to find work, stay a little with her partner, who can even come for a week visit to Palma.
However, the content of the communication is clear that the relationship fell apart.
In March 2008 alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is a mad that I left for work."
"When I told him, thought he was good, but now he realizes that it must be low all day and can not do what he wanted."
And speaking of text messages just received: "I want you to return later this month or give me the address where you want me to send a child."
He complains: "If he does not like me had little to my mother, I'll take it when I get back," he said.
May talks about his return to his residence: "This week a go, but only to refrain from the 19th, 20th because I have to go to work, I come to this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, she takes her son to him.
"We shall, with whom it should be, so to me, and I never will happen, I would leave him with anyone except my mother," a dubious project, given its poor relations.
In July, there is another post.
When keyed this message, it is assumed that a child who arrived on the island the first day of this month, and probably killed 10, is already dead.
"Cesar is satisfied on the one hand, but on the other side is not."
"On the one hand, it is with me and he quite likes it here, but on the other hand, goes almost every day to school."
He talks about moving to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the son) to summer school, so I save a little money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"Big mouth of Caesar, who asks me when you arrive."
"Alberto says that he sent you know how to email video, look how he pleases, meet with me, sex is needed."
Thirtieth next message: "The boy is well, going to summer school to learn Catalan.
There is also a report about Victor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
The Internet is Monica's post on blogs devoted to anime and manga.
He even had his own MySpace, now revised, where he kept saying "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Terror on galicijsku (motto).
The last man with whom she lived, the keeper, expressed his regret and feel guilty.
He does not want to believe that everything happened because he did not say a single mother.
Mónica yesterday entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma, where she came from a detention center in Menorca.
Advocate, Carlos Makkedah, said that the accused does not remember how everything happened, "it did not intend to hurt something small."
Previously, however, admitted that Cesar had drowned in the bathtub, and ordered his body in the trunk.
The defense attorney also requested a psychiatric examination.
The Christian Democrats would gain 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Catalan Socialist Party - ed. Acknowledges the.) Would have lost 9 mandates
with the results of 28 PA in November the party could have the final word on the town hall in Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes received and experienced by Members in recent autonomous elections, Catalan PP (Popular Party of Catalonia - ed. Acknowledges the.) Already has the idea of ​​the general election, either a rise or not, the chances are more than positive, as number of votes in a nationwide election is usually one such comparison Catalan elections.
In 2008 he won the Catalan Christian Democrats in the general election, 610,473 votes, while in the autonomous elections of 2006 the figure was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, got a PPC (Popular Party of Catalonia) 384,091 votes.
Holds If this trend increases, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, that party analysts calculate that if the general election, the PPC could gain 12 House members from the current 8, the party CIU (Convergencia i Unio, Czech Compliance and Union - ed. acknowledges the.) would also received 4 seats (now has 10) and the PSC would have lost at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has the parties PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) is essential.
According to this analysis, the People's Party the party ERC (Catalan Left-wing Republican Party - ed. Acknowledges the.) Lost one MEP - now has 3 - while the ICV (Initiative for Catalonia Greens - ed. Acknowledges the.) Would still have one seat, or would have received one more others.
However, according to the electoral calendar will be the closest rendezvous held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, which could also have a decisive influence on the Christian Democrats end domination of the Socialists in four major provincial cities as well as changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one administrations of the most anticipated budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
As nationalists and Christian Democrats agree with the PSC could lose City Hall in Barcelona, ​​Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the Socialists have not received a majority, and even they could not turn to their traditional allies, the parties ERC and ICV.
Given the debacle of the Republicans would not be impossible, if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona council - as it should be a minimum 5% of the vote.
By PP increased the number of votes obtained in four major cities, and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, ​​Lleida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe that they could play a major role in the turnover in Tarragona, where he ruled jointly by PP against the current mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
in Lerida won PA by only 500 votes more than the PSC, the Mayor Ros Angel has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoyem - during the last campaign on several occasions met.
The Christian Democrats also gained on other major councils like Badalona Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently PA has represented for 34 councils in Catalonia and would like to create a list of candidates as possible in most communities.
Catalan cell gave Al-Qaeda one thousand passports
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, ​​were detained three more in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were arrested by agents of the General Headquarters of the information in Barcelona, ​​formed a jihadist cell which is controlled from Thailand, which arranges passports to various groups of the Al-Qaeda, among them the "Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam" and "Lashkar-e- Taiba, with the latter group was the author of the bombings in Mumbai in 2008 which killed 106 people.
Interior Ministry investigation into this matter attaches great importance, aims to provide assistance "operations Kampai" counterfeiting apparatus weakening al-Qaida at international level "to reduce its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimate that this cell could, within two years, was active in Catalonia, to send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where he forged and then delivered to groups that make up the galaxy criminal organization Al-Qaeda for their "warriors" can travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
The broken cells were not only active, it had a network of Jihad in Europe, and therefore these investigations in addition to the Thai service attended by other European police forces, and therefore can not be excluded that in the coming days, if in other European countries, similar interventions, as was the in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this transaction (when they were detained by Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Iftikhar Ahmad Malik, Mohammad Saddique Begum Khan, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) is further developed in Thailand, where they were captured by Pakistani Butt and Mohammad Athar Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was precisely these men who drove from Bangkok cell based in Spain and another in other European countries.
Catalan Network, part of which was destroyed in 2009, mainly for tourists stolen passports that meet the demands of Islamists.
This means that documents had to belong to men aged 25-45 years, had to be valid for several years and shown to be without visas.
The investigative documents stressed that they are not yet aware of any facts which would detainees connected with the assassination of Catalonia in Mumbai, though the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba, was to be one of the groups that accepted the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination was sent from Catalonia transfer agency about a thousand dollars, which were "inserted" to buy mobile phone cards, which were later used by members in "Commando," which killed 106 people.
Police have already confiscated many pieces of evidence.
Popular Party (PP) requires meat to stop the fiscal agreement
President of the PPC (Popular Party of Catalonia), Alicia Sánchez-Camacho yesterday had an opportunity to express personally their meat Arthur conditions under which it is willing to support the inauguration of President of the Generalitat, the conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their first priority is to revive the economy and waiver is a risky business as the economic agreement, the leader of the nationalists wanted to propose in its mandate.
President of the Catalan Christian Democrats appeared before a meeting with Arthur meat with certainty received 18 parliamentary seats in elections last Sunday, a figure more than satisfactory for obtaining the sympathy of CIU, therefore the candidate needs to at least one of the formations comprising the opposition abstained from voting on his assignment office.
The possible agreement with the PA depends on future alliances that would like to keep the Nationalists in the House, will be held until the general election, but so far the talks, which leads these days the people is the rest of the political leaders to bear in the Catalan spirit.
As president of the PA in order to gain support for its inauguration, will need to put an end to all manifestations of sovereign and liberation ," as well as an economic agreement - similar to the Basque country - where a wanted leader of the CIU even have to vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down bloated political apparatus autonomous administration and reduce the inheritance and gift taxes.
Details of the negotiations on entry into the mass function will be addressed in the PA and Jordi Cornet Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), which promised stiff opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will meet with Joan Puigcercósem (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans), and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidarity).

Joan Vila DILM admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and since that time did not stop killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of the bodies of eight homes for elderly clients with the suspicion that in many cases the doctor did not view any deceased person, but that - given the age and poor health status of patients - everything is handled over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday by its director, flatly rejected this extreme and emphasized that "the lack of action could never be the cause of which was done."
La Caritat lawyer added that "in case there is no evidence that the defendant's own addition, any third party makes a mistake."
The man now dubbed the "Angel of Death" he said yesterday, killing 11 and pointed out that the first crime committed by the 29th August 2009 and a month and a half later, the second killed an old woman.
in this case caused the death of submitting too much insulin, unlike the first case ever used a mixture of sedative pills.
La Caritat director, said it is difficult to control staff access to medikamentům.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives may have been in six of nine cases means that the caregiver was taking the patient killed in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, only analysis, which is now underway in the laboratory, should show whether the villa lies and actually looking for his first victim under a cruel death, or killed, by contrast, administration of liquor, as already acknowledged in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
La Caritat zdravotníkovým not believe the claim, nor exclude that the number killed could be higher than what is admitted, and justify their behavior in different versions, which gave Villa the court knowing that he must change his conduct when it came out that he killed eight people.
Therefore, say they want justice to be available to be illuminated by the full range of issues.
The European Central Bank risk
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to yesterday's threat to the European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Marginal differentials are entered into force and European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we also should not underestimate the capacity of the European Central Bank to be wrong - just the euro rose above the critical value.
This is what occurred yesterday, is typical of an illiquid market, which, although there is a decrease, is recovering - but with a very short speculative positions.
Investor will take some time before losing concern.
A month ago we cited a European Central Bank, today to withdraw liquidity level, and tomorrow will have to be the fourth time in two years to appeal.
Bundesbank demanded termination of the plan to buy back the national debt and eliminate inefficiencies for all emergency measures of liquidity in the period and retain unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the level of liquidity forecasting "at least until March," and respect the three-month bidding and unlimited access to the end of this trimester, so as to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that it will continue its program of buying bonds and even notify its intensification.
Not meet the expectations created when, created by the reaction of the markets again yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue downloading liquidity ratio, God with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where he argued that even considered buying the bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - tomorrow could be the same story.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced a bazooka on Monday and Wednesday said it has bought many of them, provoking another market collapse.
Yesterday's bidding bills for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million of 5.28%, compared with 750 million of 4.81% from the previous auction.
Which therefore rates in Portugal fell below 30 points, reflecting the change in market sentiment, which occurred after Trichet spoke.
in Ireland was published figures represent losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts are approximately 10,000 million in short-term securities and other potential 15,000, and February have the chance to become a private equity, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, in July after stress tests did not reveal the problem, the amounts are within acceptable auxiliary plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, will need to obtain government approval of new budget in parliament, and still has enough support so that the Irish government remains uncertain.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of his speech, to release tension in the face for the next meeting of EU leaders of the 14th December, where it must be a political compromise, which would indicate that the union and we're all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present the action plan, which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, reduce the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment - to the ears of investors that sounds like The Four Seasons by Vivaldi.
Dual effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose by 4.5%, which is twice those of other European exchanges.
Unlike in February was the government's response and the Spanish national bank quick and compelling - probably benefited from a surprise effect.
Today we have a key bond bidding for three years, which will be favored Trichet effect, following which, we hope it will be a big demand, which will help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Ask the rescue plan would be to sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash, we do not need - in El Tesoro is available 40.000 million in cash, three times more than in March - by the high interest rates and access to markets, we closed sine die.
However, it should continue to use the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not just be that, but even with the dream."
Prove it.
President of the Group companies conduct attacks Eulen Vega Sicilia wanted his children
Storm in open conflict in the family Álvarezových, company owners and El Eulen enebro, rage.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, attacks, after it had taken a "totally irrelevant" all acts of El enebro scheduled for 16 this month and requested five of his seven children, where they would have to try to enforce their majority and seize with the help of attorney, administration of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons David and Jesús María José legal group fine-tunes for a new chapter in their dispute for control of the company.

APPEAL FOR judge is to resolve the dispute only legal means to guarantee the convening of the Commission.
The last step, Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marty and Elvira Álvarezových Mezquirizových David Alvarez regarded as "desperate means of serving his five children through legal tricks and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the meeting of 18 January, which was wholly invalid."
This argument will serve as the basis for the justification of legal challenge of the meeting as "completely meaningless."
Protagonists themselves, who discreetly silent, already tried without success, the court convened a hearing in June.
El enebro, the group owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven children of David Álvarez 100% of the capital.

This issue is a key issue that will have to decide when the trial judge issues court challenge to action. The date of this hearing has been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes to improve the vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull vpadnul to show Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world is characterized by speed and surprise success.
At first no one took too seriously the possibility of this newcomer to the team, despite the upward trend of recent times, we all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso Ferrari.
Without wishing to reduce riding skills champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of the Renault engine, which powers his car in the world of Formula 1 legend was born - a "secret weapon" by the multinational Siemens ordered into the hands of Red Bull to make it to the winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company launched in 2007 to a remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software instrument was used to design assembly lines in factories around the world, in power plants and equipment with high precision.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or to simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary confusion and expense.
PLM facilitate the development of the Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and most famous commercial of the Nissan vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of industrial group Siemens, explains that the use of software instruments allow Red Bull to make "a few hours, in almost real-time" modifications and improvements, which are otherwise detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 employed a stable average of 10 technicians who were able to carry up to three or four over a period of improvement.
Red Bull team is working today on 180 young highly skilled professionals equipped with a powerful information technology that analyzes and designs each type of modified racing vehicles.
Head of Siemens explained that PLM software can analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing car except the engine, which is fully responsible for Renault.
Modifying materials, fuels, aerodynamics and safety features.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours with advanced manufacturing systems using laser and high-tech autoclave.
The only limit the amount of technical advances is $ 40,000,000 representing the maximum they can each Formula 1 team set out for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up about 50 miles from London race tech is used to design and manufacture of its racing cars.
There are two buildings, into which entry is restricted visits - especially journalists.
Everything that is happening, is considered the "big secret."
List of interested in this project comprises 580 people including two pilots - Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1 is without a doubt the new world champion Sebastian Vettel.
For unfathomable technological means to make energy drinks contributed to his participation in racing circles, hides other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, and yet nobody knows.
Chief Production Technologies Steve Neve says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in research and development of vehicles contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest were due to drivers.
Currently, this ratio changed and the technology behind the success of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Neve recognizes that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computers, because they are "unpredictable gladiators.
HP shall, within two years 20 of its own stores, in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with their trading partner Pont Reyes yesterday officially opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This event will be the first network of 20 stores covering an area of ​​80-100 square meters, that this multinational company in Spain is planning to open in the next two years.
These stores are also located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Vice President of the Spanish Helena Herrera gave the example of the newly rebuilt store on Gran Vía Barcelona, ​​belonging to the Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe in 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), shop in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not reveal where they opened another store, but admitted that Madrid would be one of the following locations.
Herrera who also leads the HP personal systems, make sure that the philosophy of open trade will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge sector.
North American business advice here with an exclusive shop equipment (products, which can be interactively test), which in Europe will be identical.
In addition, HP also addresses the provision of staff for the stores.
Helen Herrera denied that there was a franchise, and stressed that the exclusive sales network aims to "improve customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises to purchase, service, after-sales service and even packaging.
Business in Barcelona, ​​is part of a pilot program to pioneer the global level, which is intended to address potential problems with computer equipment under warranty.
Online service is linked with a technical center based in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"So we can in 10 minutes to solve problems that otherwise may take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium enterprises and ordinary consumers, given that large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helen Herrera yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that the "stolen" during the three years of its competitors million clients
More optimistic than other chiefs, delegated member of the Board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but denied a new liquidity crisis and a passive predicts the end of the war.
Yet counts are lower interest rates, although they try to compensate slevněním bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to succeed him three years to get a million private clients.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and be able to survive in tough economic conditions.
The bank started in 2011 a new strategic plan with a term of three years.
The aim, in addition to survival without recourse to public assistance in FROB, gain market share comprehensiveness million new private customers - or 700.000 shall be deducted if those who may leave the bank - because up until now and even more spoiled Institute for Small and Medium Entrepreneurs and large companies than small clients.
This year, the Bank has 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in terms of private clients, 3.5%, while corporate customers are more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas Plan 2011-2013 is a commitment to productivity, or it can be said also of sobriety in order to reduce costs, the call will show the bank, and will present results for the period.
A few banking institutions at this time, dare to set targets and publish them, since the financial crisis changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell this close its Optima program, established four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the situation on the markets required extension for a further period.
Clients who retire from the savings banks, their main target group.
At a meeting held APIE Guardiola insisted that the 2011 will be "difficult and very important."
Truly believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy.
In addition, two or three years' very hard to create jobs, "which is the fundamental survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although believes that passive war - which reduces the margin - retreats, price premiums for the risk that banks and building societies pay for their emissions in order to receive liquidity is already shifting to the cost of credit, which offsets the reduction in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor exerting pressure on the loans."
"We have not made the trigger, but the differentials are very high," acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto has released its network on Thursday, orders to reduce long-term loans and the increased price differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
It also acknowledged that the trends in banking, "Now is the reduction of commissions, but there is a" competitive framework ."
Strategic Plan for the Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual, does not exclude a group of corporate operations.
Not for nothing assures that Spain "will require a larger size.
"Next year, the stone is left unturned," he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are "a lot" and that does not mean that any Spanish institution enters into the red numbers.
And points out that the market may FROB substitute for collecting funds from a new measure of capital.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets remains a serious problem of what some bankers are predicting a new crisis of liquidity.
He notes that it is not the issue, but in contrast to what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through the repo rate, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of merger savings
General Director of CECA refused yesterday that it had created another wave of merger savings, and again insisted on the speed with which it carries out sector reorganization.
When you started the process of association of Spanish savings banks, several institutions have assured that this first stage and wait to attend the second round.
However, the CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled that there should be a new wave of operations.
"I believe that most mergers have already been implemented, Cajasol incorporation into Banca Civica group can be regarded as the second round, that is, what happens as the Convention."
"Most of them are fully implemented, it is possible that instead of the 17 institutions will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated in this matter very well," said the director.
In their statements at the meeting Adea (Association of directors and executive officers of Aragon - ed. Acknowledges the.) Olavarrieta portrayed the process of consolidation takes place "as fast as possible and we are very happy to be reported in installments, which were once, not now , appeared in the business plans of the Spanish national bank, "he said.
"Go from 45 societies, with an average volume of 28,000 million of assets at 17 to 75 500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62%, that they were larger and thus in accordance with the Basel agreement, stressing.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are many opinions very happy to slow the process of" showing "a lack of seriousness and understanding," because "what makes the Spanish National Bank is a reminder that we must be before the end of the term."
CECA CEO Jose Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the highest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and those who challenge it, attributed "lack of knowledge."
The Director noted that the current favorable economic situation, "we can have peace of mind" for financial institutions and savings and a system that managed to "very important" and that the process of concentration continues "as fast as possible.
It also pointed out that the Spanish banking sector became very well from the stress tests conducted by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and German Red Line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but set conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, designed by José Luis Zapatero, the new adaptation, by reducing taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or cancellation of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to privatize 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Control - Ed. acknowledges the.) Barajas airport manager and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, on the other hand, joined the critics of the address by Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret this emotion?
Let advance said that Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
Here, Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which runs counter to the idea of ​​respect for old traditions, which hold a large portion of other members.
In the face of European opposition in Germany begin to speculate about three possible ways out of crisis.
The first of these Does heavy euro area, the part of which was just Germany, but also as Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern states left the monetary zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although now it may seem like science fiction, this version has broad public support, with approaching 50%.
The third option, according to the German proposal for a recast of the euro, with more macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigor, penalties for delinquent States, possible delays in payments to some of them, and enlargement of the potential costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has already defined some time, so no excuses now space.
First, when in 2009 the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged the deficits, pulling his sleeve, the German government has a constitutional reform to enable them to prevent from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what is considered good for Germany (plans for fiscal rigor and the stability of public finances), and as practiced by its European partners, including France.
Species have shown this Central European country, while Merkel has painfully dragged decisions about saving Greece.
Even if the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were forcefully against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October Merkel has reappeared with a clear opinion when asked to reform the Convention, the European Union so as to allow rescue of a Member State and to private creditors have an obligation to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, Irish crisis since the speed and everything else.
But the proposal, although in somewhat attenuated form, was approved over the next months, we should pursue the reform process of the Union, which had since 2013 to allow such measures.
Germany has set a red line that does not intend to cross.
And everyone tells us that although it is now necessary to take precautions, which are probably not disagree, since that date will be the end of the old operation of the euro.
Year 2013 will be the birth of a new currency area in which states were in violation of the rules severely penalized and may be forced to announce suspension of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some costs.
Germany shows us that we must give a strict path of growth by increasing savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on the debt and building, with huge gaps in the balance, which prevailed in the boom years of growth in Spain, just not going to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we made a mistake, we do not understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to, is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these circumstances, we could be that you make a mistake themselves.
I hope that these will replace the current turmoil quieted down.
And that we will use the opportunity that gives us the spring 2013th
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero is also understood, and its dual statement (reforms promised after a meeting with big companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel paved the way to the idea that it is necessary to put things okay.
But the red line, which Germany has set itself, there is, and it does seem that it would like to move.
And the options over which they may consider not leaving full eurozóny very serious countries excluded.
Well, Germany are always going to be able to say that we were warned.
Sports and circumvent the rules
Tricks, which showed Alonso and Ramos in a match with Ajax, but savvy show intent to escape punishment.
Allegedly concocted the exclusion of two players of Real Madrid (Xabiho Alonso, Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on the 23rd November meant that it was the sea of ​​ink printed on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether it would eventually UEFA not to punish the two football players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which was clearly won by the team) nominated players one by one, deliberately wasting time when the cue ball was foul, so sudího provoked, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players meet the prescribed punishment in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid expires at the head of their group - and will be deprived of cards, go to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA awarded coach Jose Mourinho penalty to two games and the guilty players were given a fine.
Provoking a yellow card in similar circumstances, there is no new practice, but is more or less normal in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, ie rules which, although unwritten, but are monitored.
Part of the discussion in this case was because the party was the team Real Madrid (who in his anthem boasts of magnanimity and honor, and which has a similar action of their players fined), and appears to be a dramatization led by Mourinho, who are thus added to its long history, a comedian and provocateur next episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct that is not expressly forbidden by the rules is contrary to the principles of the sport, is whether in these works is to circumvent the law, it is truly a sporting event respecting the rules that make sense, however, as it seems, trying to circumvent.
It addresses what type of damage such conduct has the spirit of sport.
One of the elements of sportsmanship and the physical integrity of an opponent who was not violated in these cases, so there was no violent games.
Another of those requirements, characterizing the net, the game is to prevent the players because of their offense had the advantage against the opponent's team - which also happened.
Thus, the paradoxical action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that there was to do what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumvent the law, not a disguised violation of the rules to avoid a penalty, but this behavior should be as far as possible in order to receive a penalty.
They waited and we got a penalty.
Another question, however, is the advantage of those guilty of willful violation of his will.
Here it is clear that the opponent lacks the disadvantaged position, and that the current struggle not yield any benefit, since the obvious implication is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even that is not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage clearly lies in the fact that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without a card, which could jeopardize their future participation in the match.
However, this benefit is long-term perspective and with some degree of uncertainty, so at first glance might be the team eliminated, and in addition, these practices have discussed adequately player penalty and will go into the second round of cards, in which the exclusion of just one card less than first round.
So how will go round, is not entirely clear whether it is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations not go against the spirit of sport, including make strategic decisions to gain the maximum benefit under the rules.
for which we are here, not the players aim to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather choose when to submit it.
Have made a strategic decision, without penalty or avoid it before fleeing.
Although the line between ingenuity and circumvention of the rules very clear, I believe that in this case clearly was a ingenuity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises from two reasons: because there were two samovyloučení and because of the way to transfer instructions to their provocation by management.
Damage to these principles of sports events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight bids to host Christmas parties in Barcelona
Dictation calendar year avalanche book concentrates on the 16th and 17 December.
Rapidly rising celebrations paid employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Just as Turkish delight or lotteries, with the advent of December again come Christmas parties, which still acts as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, ​​but because the crisis resulted in a struggle to get clients by lowering the price: almost everyone wants to spend on food in 1920 to 30 euros, respondents agree with entrepreneurs and associations in this sector.
In order to complete complication counts, esters concentrate this calendar year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) requests per week from 13 December, which was an avalanche of bookings on peak days (16 and 17), whereas in the previous week was almost no traffic.
How it works since 2008, when it began to lean years, many companies, which collectively parties abolished for budgetary reasons.
To have left the tradition, many employees do not pay spending binge of his own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many require prices to breaking point, says president of restaurants Gremi de restauracia de Barcelona Gaiety Farras.
Representative patronage of restaurants at this moment dare to predict what will be the celebration of this month.
"People have been pleased to think twice before you make a reservation."
"They want to go, but if price is an issue, they are cautious," he adds.
Stores well go to "those who offer quality and good service at an affordable price," he says, and points out that because of the crisis, customers tend to go a step down, and most customers would now spend about 25 euros.
A survey of various plants shows that the greatest rush of applications for reservations for the evening of the 17th December.
Soteras Group reports boom in real reservations for this Friday, with most requests are for spending the 30 euros, to which adjust to the menu offered, whose total cost is 25 to 30 euros.
in other major companies, which Andilana, comprising 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought this trait more calendars early reservation and has been since early November.
"We made the impossible possible, to keep prices from last year, and our menus, which should choose each, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," the letter says.
In group AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, attic, and a total QuQu comprises 23 companies remain optimistic when he scored from second half growth in profits and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources of this stress that the 18th December will be busy day, as they will hold a Christmas celebration among friends.
With their six group Christmas menus add menus, with a budget of 30 euro or more, as seen in comparison with last year, people tend to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - ed. acknowledges the)..
Also noticed that there are no companies that once again inviting their employees, and it appears that group size is slightly larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of bars, restaurants and leisure centers in Barcelona), Enric Goma believe that it will start to see the end of the tunnel, arguing that the number of bookings are "revived," though the clients' contracts to the maximum. "
This impression, either during the Christmas celebrations did not back down, pays, who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program begat a big unrest in the U.S.
Islamabad produce nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirms the link between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published a special portal Wikileaks confirms unrest in Washington raises the Pakistani nuclear program.
In addition to clarifying and important details that offer the content of the communication of ideas and representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries as regards nuclear safety, rather than to increase, "is on the wane" and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
Specificity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but the stock with the parts that hindered by their destruction in case of attack - one of the main reasons vigilance Washington.
This is calculated as Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of the then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban control, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear materials."
Increased number of people associated with the nuclear arsenal and missile program is no longer seen only the U.S. but also Russia, as a spreading and constituting a reason to be wary.
"Pakistan had to protect nuclear facilities to hire staff with strict religious beliefs, due to a decline in the level of education and culture with extremist groups more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs and missile programs," said an expert Yuri Korolev of Russia's Foreign Ministry on meeting with their U.S. counterparts.
The biggest news server documentation published Assangeho Julian is getting less cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation, Pakistan's pace increased production of these weapons.
Dispatches embassy issued in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "there is often Transparence; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected.
in another report notes Peter Lavoe, the national intelligence officer for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster of Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as any other nation in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also calls on Washington, during a visit to the army chief General Ashfaq Kayaniho, "well explained" that "the Pakistani army must break with the tacit support of terrorist groups."
The hunt for chief Wikileaks
Obama has appointed a senior officer responsible for combating terrorism in order to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issued a "red challenge" to track and identify where it could be Assange.
Everything on Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assangeho form a complicated labyrinth, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary challenge," the so-called red notice, to "locating and tracking" Assangeho.
But this is not a classic statement of the detention.
Moreover, this challenge is not new but dates back to the 20th November.
And has nothing to do with the recent release of more than a quarter million of diplomatic documents, but rather with allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australian face in Sweden.
In addition, the author assures Wikileaks lawyer Mark Stephens, that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assangem.
Was 20 November, when the chorus of international police headquarters in Lyon, France issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, the 188 countries of the Interpol guidelines to identify and locate Assangeho "to impose the temporary detention and release him."
Although Interpol detained person can not order concerning red challenge in many Member States, as the organization explained, however to be called red notice enables za arrest made - it must be to safeguard national component of the police - especially in cases where States have an agreement oboustrannou on the issue of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where he would probably find Assange.
This step offend Assengeho lawyers, who yesterday published writing, which argued that Wikileaks-year-old founder expressed willingness to answer questions via videoconference the Swedish authorities.
Also, note that Assenge subsequently requested and received permission to leave Sweden by prosecutor in their case, which compares with the legendary Lavrentijem Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This is not a legal hunt and persecution," the letter indicates.
While it looks for all the world - from Australia, his mother defended her son's innocence - Assange is away at an undisclosed location, but hold not thy peace.
Monday provided through Skype from an unknown location interviews editor in chief of Time magazine - in this interview called for resignation of United States Hillary Clinton.
'If that was responsible for U.S. orders diplomats to carry out espionage in the United Nations and violated the international conventions signed by the United States should withdraw, "he said.
His view was yesterday rejected by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who described the demise of the claim as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should depend on individual opinion, which operates a Web site," he said on CNN.
Obama himself was responsible for senior staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further releases of documents.
The intention of the speaker of President Barack Obama to stop adding to the importance Assangemu contrasts with the views, which these days are avowedly conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of Congress, from January to chair the Committee on National Security in the lower house, the State Department asked to investigate the Wikileaks include the terrorist organization "in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who they would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance ."
Went even further, Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed," which subsequently had to withdraw.
"Obama would reward him should write or use unmanned aircraft, or something like that."
Who apology, was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former Arkansas guvernátor and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, is guilty of treason and any other punishment than execution would be too modest," he said on Fox
Puigcercós in the ERC is looking for peace "pomrkáváním" on partisan Caroda
The Republican leader will hand a ballot of its continuance.
Huguette suggests a more plural executive and end schůzovního system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe on how to fight with one of several internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Republican Left-wing Party of Catalonia - ed. Acknowledges the.), To no avail due to the loss of 11 parliamentarians and half the votes.
Party leader is aware that his gesture seems about the demise of the former leader of the followers of Josep Lluis Rovira Caroda-deficient, and also knows that the influence of the industry is now so weakened himself as its leader, and that he absolutely can not make such a charge, they had with other extinct streams.
Therefore, the leader of the Left try to get a new criticism by pomrkávání, it helps to hedge the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós said yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to speak secretly to his continuance in office.
With ballots, not raising his hand.
If supporters want to pass the President Caroda criminal voice, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid division and subjugation of its people.
claimed in several interviews that could not be regarded as confirmed with half the votes and one more, but he added, without specifying a percentage, it would also not be a good result "from Bulgaria."
Supporters Caroda require the President more than to give their function - which I think is a gesture that has no weight as a control on the descents Puigcercós largest organ.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority in order to enforce the resignation, they will try to remind the Executive of the plan from now until May.
Because they expect to participate in preparing a document on the strategic reorientation, which gives guidance on the national council to vote on the 18th of the month.
Their aim is to encourage Puigcercóse exchange for that promise to move Congress in the autumn 2011th
ERC leader said that "mnohohlasnost 'harms stability, and that his goal is to once and for all the organization was able to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
in this context appears to be symptomatic of an article that the current adviser, Josep Huguette toll on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercósův ideologues, the advisors to take innovation as a fait accompli, the leader will be confirmed "in exchange for some goals."
And those appointed five of which stand two.
The first is "překomponování" executive so as to form at least 90% of the members, which means also include new faces who are inclined Carodovi the sector.
The second objective may be big news.
Huguette proposes to do away entirely with the ERC as a mechanism of schůzovnictvím.
And fighting for reform of the statutes, to be held congresses of delegates chosen by ballot.
Ending schůzovního model system, the exception in the Spanish party system is intended to Puigcercósova team in this area who fought in the last two congresses.
However, convulsive Assembly in 2008 decided that schůzovnictví must be considered at a special congress to reform the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party have been discouraged from addressing this issue.
Now, without the watchful critical sectors, could be a good time to again look into this matter and try to close it forever.

the literature inserted his finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga" translated "to insert a finger into the wound" is similar to the Czech "hit the nail on the head - ed. acknowledges the.)
The second round of the cycle of pleasure tongue was a promenade, where participants performed a literary gala performances
"This is sex in a language I understand, but ... the finger into the wound, what's waiting for me?" Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuelová, who was invited to open the second round of pleasure in language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish language, which question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (in a fair round table devoted to the topic in the language of sex, she explained).
Finger into the wound "brings us into straits, she said sweetly Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to listen to this roundtable discussion, moderated by Marisol Schultz and participation Valenzuelové, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuelová read the text that gave Gonzalo Celoriovi, and that Schultz identified after a great story, which featured Luis in the first person as protagonist, who, in search of knowledge, what is the "bump" going from doctor to doctor, from whom it receives responses, although traces of the same story, yes.
Since leaving infektologa convinced that "patience is not my forte, maybe this will be my morning.
Eventually, the frustration with the trauma that took her breath halfway point, but explained to her that morning is not a scientific term, is a psychoanalyst who discovers a secret: "Morning is really wide open and the scar is symbolic."
The main characters of the sigh relief and concluded that "the wound, she managed to learn only so much that it actually rozevřeným and that does not exist," but became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuelová played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also spoke with a delightful tale, which he called Praise invention, which is appointed by the finger in the wound, but in one moment they appear.
with elements of magic realism, tells the story of a famous witch, who played the clouds, bringing back people who have gone away, to repair or honesty, which lost a virgin, this narrative, which then turned to speak American, a great novel, which from the beginning not miss its own chroniclers, who told him, and there is quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration in the telling captains of conquest.
"Cervantes, who all of us (writers) invented fake ridiculed testimony that was presented as true stories, but otherwise has never failed to tell America's story with such imagination that lacked even a shame."
However, he emphasized, "are fools and liars who have more imagination," and where it merges fact and lie, where no one knows what the story belongs to one group and as a second, fictional reaches its peak.
This is indeed called "cervantovskou tradition.
"His legacy we have what we have."

Cuban-Puerto Rican writer showed his finger at the big blow of social violence, which crosses the country - and shares it Latin America - is the result of trade disputes and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs closed quiet compromise, which of course is not intended," she said after pointing out that the reality of literature is communication and compromise dimensions that are created between the author and readers - and their "chemical response. "
The evening concluded the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also stressed "the finger into the wound itself bound by writers writer."
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual habits and control of consciousness, full of dogmatism, to forget it, "that behind every little say-so is hidden and not every denial is also a small yes."
"To be masters of our thoughts and the reality we have to spin: spin and mean times to insert his finger into the wound and the harass those individuals who are much more comfortable as the mind in cartoons, black and white, in zafixovaných ideas and without discoloration, and harass the authorities, who prefer The black and white world, "he said, to promote a sense of writing.

Ruben Omar Romano includes three defeats in the finals, his career has seen good and bad, but he has achieved on three occasions at a crucial series, but until now left to get nothing, and that's why this is an extraordinary opportunity for him.
Argentinian had to settle for the silver medal, left step and quaintly champions played with the same team following the final.
Santistický strategist as a coach came to his first final of the Apertura tournament in 2002, when he hands the reins of the club in Morelia, which succumbed to 4-2 overall against Toluca, then in the Clausura 2003 tournament, again advanced to the decisive duel, and it also lost a total score 3-1, which was against a team Rayados.
Even with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluky, Ruben again suffered defeat, though his team played against the "Uzenářům" (another nickname Club Deportivo Toluca - ed. Acknowledges the.) To 210 minutes of play a draw 2 -2, after a series of penalty shots to get the benefits of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but eventually the three players missed the 11 steps and the team suffered a turnover of 4 to 3
Ruben has lost two finals against the "red devils" and one of Toluky against Monterrey, his future rival, therefore, would like to avoid the same fate, and got rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the first title, though he says that for him is the most important institution.
"I want to come out a winner, I do not break the statistics, this is for the club, the passion that I am obliged, and the title would, of course, for me, but the first is most important," stated the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the finals against him.
vividly remember my previous finals, in which, as confirmed, learned a lot, "we took away the message that, until the referee nezapíská end, we can celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because the last two penalty, we have were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that we have learned that, until the match ends, we can not celebrate. "
Worried about it, that this series could decide the penalty shots, believes in his players: "I'm never trying to be a series of penalty kicks, trying to finish in normal time, but sometimes no other option and need to be prepared in the past tournament, we were ready, but unfortunately fate has prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of nerves and anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost him, it left something in us and hopefully this time there is no such thing " .
Romano is in your hands a chance to stop being the second and first taste of fame by bringing titles.

Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of traders Zona Dorada, noted that it has repeatedly requested that a move to impress destinations and bad, as there are tourists that were replaced with new activities and routes.
He said that the poor condition of streets and sidewalks has the tourists who pass through here and sees the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close for one day business, and have no idea about sales, which escapes, or tackling these issues for so long without proper planning.
Hotelier Manguart José Ramón Sánchez said that the fall in tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance of the hall.
"City Hall will have to take responsibility and prevent a repeat something will have to devote to preventive maintenance, not only to repair existing defects" she said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of the tourist area we would be doing maintenance, for even as residents deserve a clean residence hall should change its strategy of maintenance.
There are other places that look neglected and poorly observed, such as the emblem and El mazatlánský Venadito (Monument, a statue of a deer - ed. Acknowledges the)..
"Today, tourists to come, not only on promotion, it should offer a good product, a city rich in its clean beaches and streets, where they made permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"She did not here that needed attention, and these facts emphasize something that is the well-known lack of maintenance.
He talked about a number of positions to be put in order, in cooperation with City Hall, said that priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because of its tourist potential.
Martínez, Raúl Llera, subtajemník Places graduation, has advocated the preservation of tourist locations in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural objects and space, but will first need to get in order to place this attractive and that we might state to the list that we have to promote this destination.
IP calls on Congress results
Eduardo Davalos, president of CCE would like Members to take great responsibility by coming in search of a better example of Sinaloa, in a variety of challenges that face the state.
Parliamentary period full of decent work and no agreements between the parties and the State executive, calls the business sector in Mazatlan, Sinaloa because of the struggles in the throes and faces huge challenges.
Since yesterday, started 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, the PAN in 1913, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to realize decent leadership, commitment to society and the various areas that require legislative responsible job, and that will not repeat the same party and paternalističtí patrons.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinating Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress took a big responsibility and a role model for a better way of Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect that members will actually exercise their rights without an agreement between the parties, because they usually make arrangements to promote their own interests and they will become a carnival procession of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Therefore, talking about the need to affirm the need to establish bridge, which would move forward according to the ruling order.
"We want to carry away a decent job and they were mainly indebted companies and sectors, because they were residents of Sinaloa, who gave them their vote in previous elections confidence.
José Ramón Sánchez Manguart, president of Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will muster all forces in order to achieve economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very complicated.
The key is to encourage economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure that will assist in some way the creation of jobs. "
As regards tourism, called the new lawmakers gave him more weight in the state budget and supported by Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is inappropriate given that this is an important economic activity, bringing foreign exchange and investment, and one that directly competes with agriculture."
In addition, to issue funds to launch tourism projects, Congress should help deliver the state for security assistance, and the law on alcohol, which has not been resolved in the previous parliamentary term.

Illegal immigration can proceed without problems.
Bill conservatives, who, according to the government should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, the obviously overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday reported that it could not support it.
"I rely significantly affected by the Charter."
"I'm standing upright on the party that built the granite beneath your feet," said head of Liberal Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after a week-week session du Caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as drafted, the law that would allow up to one year to retain any person from the ship, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of Quebec of the Bloc, Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it is directed to the wrong destination.
"We're against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we'll see what the government does," Mr Duceppe said.
NPD critic in question, on migration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected critics who want the party was not strong enough in terms of illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against the traffickers of illegal immigrants, and that's what we believe are an essential part of another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"Conservatives do not support the bill because it places blame on the refugees and children to appreciate in jail for at least one year," explained Ms Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"Canadians collectively communicated to Members that can not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations, which take Canada to fly and deal with it as some sycophant."
Expect to see Canada take consistent action, the Minister responded to Kenney.
The government did not declare a vote of confidence to its bill, which could lead the country to elections, leading to its rejection.
A conservative yet QMI Agency said that the government will seek the vote that any member who is against the responsible of his position before his constituents ..
The new unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement on the possible creation of a permanent unit for fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continued to demand a public inquiry commission on the issue.
Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, seeks to ensure that this idea did not fit into oblivion: Quebec plans with the Department of Investigation in New York to discuss this issue in January next year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption drive since 1870.
Therefore, many a Tuesday announcement from us by surprise.
It should be noted that at a meeting of the Permanent Council for police services in Quebec 29th October last year, this measure was not discussed even though he was present himself Robert Dutil.
More, it was necessary for public safety critic, partisan PQ Stéphane Bergeron rated this announcement as a "rabbit extracted from the hat" and "amateur solution to the botched knee.
Dutil Minister himself said those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"Will the confirmation: see the result, and announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjeana Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of examination of witnesses during public hearings.
"In addition, Mr. Charest confirms that wants to create this commission of inquiry, and people think like you and me, hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve a commission of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest, said on the matter, Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for training senior civil servants.
In order to get out of this impasse, he suggested Quebec special powers granted to the General Inspector in order to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General's" decision.
It also considered that Quebec could give an inspector the same powers as commissioners, which allows to force people to testify.
Creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings Charestovy government.
Quebec would also be on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code, so that was better suited for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the agent for the transaction Marteau (Hammer), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier, the law of this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson is currently dealing with some amendments associated with this file.

Dupont partially disgraced yourself
Quebec radio host Stephane Dupont suffered a partial failure of the Canadian Council for standards of Radio and Television Broadcasting (RRTV) because of controversial statements related to social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to the harsh expression during the broadcast.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting considers that Mr. Dupont and his band of CHOI 98.1 FM had a right to express their views, but some statements were "inaccurate information about social assistance and undue negative representations Haitians coarse expression, which does not broadcast during the broadcast of ."
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including posting the names of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting has received several complaints about comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken after a complaint common front of Quebec social assistance recipients.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not false.
Regarding suicide, the moderator Stephane Dupont thought that suicide is a gesture of despair.
Most of its members concluded that the transmitted message was that suicide can be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episode aired" Dupontových midday news hit the delicate topic of equitable and appropriate manner. "
She was raised against him, no complaints.
The last case concerned a statement that followed the earthquake victims.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort, therefore, gave the media a firefight, which provoked many reactions.
Moderator CHOI said that did not send any donation to help the Haitians, because we can not know with certainty that the necessary money to actually get there.
The Commission believes that these comments were unjustified, but their cumulative effect creates an undue negative image of Haitians.
"I've atoned for my three-day postponement of the matter."
"My file is intact as early as one year and a half," said the moderator.
In all the Commission's decision refusing to use the broadcast crude language.
Anyway, radio CHOI FM-cooperation 'beyond their duties. "
For a station that will also have to announce this decision once during the main broadcasting within three days, are minimal implications.
King Kung fuvà du Montreal.
Resident of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special ramp.
An athlete who excels in "Sand" (kung-fu "Full Contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the ring mat and all over the world looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal, APPLICABLE who live in the city since 2008 to teach the professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games everywhere a bit, because for those who do not like the game on the ground that occurs in fighting sports competitions are rare in North America."
Recently this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS just delivered the bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Championships in the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 30 October, Edimburgu, Scotland.
"I won the category of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing, he said."
"Currently in China preparing for the World Cup in san shou."
"They were invited by opponents, who finished first in the last four world championships in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005 I was in Vietnam, finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the tournament in the fifth rank, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third, he said."
"It is interesting that in every competition I have made some progress."
"At this rate I'll be first this year or next year!"
"San shou" or "Sand" is the discipline of Chinese origin, where fistfights and legs, as well as throwing on the ground allowed.
Matches are held traditionally on the platform, and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, coming from this form of struggle, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, a well-known in the world of martial arts.
While he has Nacer Zemmal keep in my career only one result, boldly acknowledge their participation in the super tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is in China's highest and most prestigious, explains the nice guy."
"It's kind of equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."

Zemmal won his first match in the semi-finals of their category (80 kg), before it suffered a loss in the final.
"He beat me, he was a real pro, analyzed.
"There are four competing on the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg).
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category."
"Then he will face the winners of each category, so one could be crowned champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million contracted for without public competition
Hydro-Quebec agreed by mutual consent, 450 million in contracts with firms providing for hydroelectric engineering project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of an avalanche of more than 100 contracts are just a consortium of companies created by BPR, Dessau, SM and Groupe Axor, which won the most important contract, contract to manage the entire project, totaling 295 million U.S. dollars without public competition.
The consortium, on behalf Énergie gérance in 2004 was authorized by the parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec, entrusted to the private sector responsibility for the management of major hydroelectric project worth $ 5 billion.
In early 2005 a consortium of "energy gérance" won a lucrative contract without a call for tenders.
For the Quebec side of the complaint to the consortium of companies present us with serious problems of ethical character, which risks eliminating competition and cause higher prices ..
"It's a new way to implement collusion and destroy competition."
"This means that people do not have a side agreement in secret, is now openly doing," he said yesterday, PQ member Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
A little earlier in the morning, M. Simard put this question to the National Assembly, because it says that hard to bear, how can the public interest so sold.
Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, afternoon, she said, vigorously denying that was the collusion of this contract.
"I have my own way" hromovala and claimed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked precision."
She said that "it would be the least" that the PQ would be excused.
The recipe for the consortium is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually the alliance, limited in time, allowing two or more firms group their mutual expertises in order to respond to the call for tender for a complex project.
Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the robustness of the work.
Construction is already running and must be laid out in 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition can act, it was business.
It should also be acknowledged that the formula is no longer in the Consortia Quebec exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, formula consortia of consulting engineering is the subject of investigations in the government.
Fly-in speed of the Quebec business registry of firms allows us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanently established.
Thus firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, to name CIMA + Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Tecsult and Roche.
Each combination, and dozens of them, leading to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As a consortium Énergie gérance, Normandeauová Minister underlined in particular that "la Baie James territory is characterized by specific dynamics of the workforce and the Hydro-Quebec, since it responds to the 70s."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, the energy of the Baie James (SEBJ), an explanation that make us pucker face the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to public tender and if the contestant submitting the low bid, your offer price may be higher."
"You have two choices: ie sebereš people who figure in the contract as entrants, and would say:" Let us conclude an agreement satisfactory and good price. "
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but people skills," affirmed Mr. Laporte.
This treaty granted the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $ 50,000 received by the Party of Quebec.
Contracts were signed with Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for consultancy in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 companies or their subsidiaries, especially in laboratories performing analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin in 1922 raked in contracts, including Génivar of them won 16, 14 and Tecsult Dessau in 1910, without a stake in the "energy gérance.
All contracts were closed.
Altogether, including both $ 449,783,344, including a contract with energy companies gérance to $ 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of a consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe Axor and SM) are "well-known Liberal Party of Quebec."
Normandeauová Minister launched a report that the PQ is also associated with companies that it "funded" before stated, it is rather a managerial level.
Barometer responsible consumption - the "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumer trust very few actors of sustainable development, but also the "impartial" certified organic brands, and for it to be managed according to the selection of products.
The worst is that even when they are bathed in a media universe that urges us and encourages a socially responsible consumption, the media universe laments the lack of reliable information, the infringement, which qualifies even as a brake on its commitment to responsible consumption Barometers states, whose first article was published yesterday.
Although the 2010 increase in consumption so-called socially responsible products, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them, but they too do not believe
Two thirds of us really say they do not believe the promises of the companies on the environment, simply because that green advertising company, discovers measuring tool developed by the responsible consumption Observatory, University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of the consumers' doubts about the veracity of official certificates enclosed for so-called fair products, but also the assurance of products and brands that are designated as environmentally responsible, says barometers.
In the same way as politicians debate on this issue is taken seriously as a mere 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
For information about responsible consumption, however, seems to be a key to stimulating the consumption of the animated pages currently nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information would alleviate 46% of consumer enthusiasm.
This is the second break, which identified the barometers, the higher price of these products.
Indeed, one third of the population puts Quebekuse wary of reported data about products or "green" services, which seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers willing to change their habits, and especially to change the brand of one or several products, which would respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them favored purchases at merchants in their area and give priority to purchasing food grown in their region, says barometers.
More "green" and responsible - responsible consumption index reached a maximum 64 of 100 for this year - Homo consumus Quebec would like to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to minimize the impact on the environment that provides for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their vehicle, according Barometer in 2010, barely 28% of the population of Quebec indicated that they use public transport or to recommend the car to run at least two people in the interest of conservation.
Walking and bike also promoted to 39,1% of the participants conduct an extensive survey who used this cliche.
State loan to purchase a complex of cinemas eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of cinema complex eXcentris Company Angus et le parallel, with the participation agreement, but only to the loan.
Developperská by Angus et le Parallel, which wanted a donation of seven million U.S. dollars from the Minister of Culture for the acquisition of a cinematographic complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent and has demonstrated its mission as a lover of Film Arts, did not receive what they requested.
The Government accepts that it will be included in the documentation, but in their own terms.
Rather than the expected present government of Quebec proposed loan, the amount of which would indeed be lower, some initially expected, which could establish a foundation for a viable solution under favorable conditions and resources by state.
The first action plan and the requirement to 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the application has been revised to reduce.
Design and plan of action has sent the Minister St-Pierre president of business development in culture (Sodeco), François Macerola that drives the film project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government came to the counter of Sodeco Tuesday.
Parallel et le Angus have the time to 31 December in to reply.
However, it appears that the hypothesis of the present state must indeed be rejected.
Recall that an association of owners of cinemas and cinema centers in Quebec to oppose direct investment law, in order to support the purchase eXcentrisu, inferring that the Minister of Culture has financed the project on the property when it has done for other theaters.
But several participants in the debate the other hand, demanded substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his room during the ten years of cinema film art after he funded the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the amendment of the financing of the State Council.
Lack of theaters for independent films in Montreal's gaudy and eXcentris you could get a permanent clientele.
Company Angus et le Parallel Yaccarini the Christian head of state, conducts a campaign to release the funds to the private sector, in the belief that utrží $ 700,000 for acquisition of extrusion.
Since spring 2009, one of three film companies, Le parallel, continuing to distribute films eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to open again all three rooms of 27 February next year and show the most beautiful movie of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini reminded of Le Devoir, and so is ignored, with the group he thinks about his proposals to reduce that he is being taken.
Curtain raised on Canada as a whole ...
The new U.S. diplomatic sources are publicized through WikiLeaks reveals what the United States consider it an inferiority complex of Canadians against Americans, but the same stroke reveal their sense of superiority of the latter against Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that each Canadian voter is at the heart of the Canadian-American relations, when it comes to vote, and believes that Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to ensure the adoption of its budget in 2009!
Four new reports have been between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, landed yesterday to show off to the public, providing extra sensitive details to get another "under the skin.
Notice dated 22 September 2008, ie the middle of an election campaign, stated in detail at what point the United States is not part of the bet, mooted by political leaders.
To their great surprise, the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives this situation a few explanations.
"Canadian inferiority complex, almost obsessively, perhaps makes the political leaders to talk about internal betting, instead of realizing that these elections are those in the United States (as the campaign for free trade in 1988)," he writes.
"The United States is, therefore, concluded," the proverbial elephant in this election: the ubiquitous, but potentially very threatening, than to talk about them. "
Ambassador understands this "ohlušujícímu silence" the less that both countries maintain an intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or party leader even more important to manage these relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Other expressions of this sense of importance can read the report, which sent 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa and Ottawa, in preparation for President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your way will help ensure that the government in a confidence vote in early February, on the federal budget, which Canada to publicly admit its first deficit in more than ten years, because of the Recovery Plan at 30 40 billion dollars," says Mr Breese.
There was no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, it can not be defeated by a coalition and the opposition party makes its survival quality of the proposed rehabilitation plan.
Another report in January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, Washington, points to an increasingly negative image that the United States cast a dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
Ambassador Border broadcasting is concerned, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be seen not so subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly List," or the kidnapping for the purpose of violent interrogation by the CIA.
Other news reports that during their first bilateral meeting with Hillary Clinton asked his French partner, Bernard Kouchner, is whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on a "case by case basis.
In the conclusion of the meeting, it says here, "gave a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin, the secretary of state."
"Secretary has adopted, with the revised component.
Note finally that the person concerned WikiLeaks, perspire.
Tom Flanagan, a former close advisor to Stephen Harper, said the waves of the CBC, the person responsible for this massive release should be "destroyed."
It went out and heard about it and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World plan to restore lighting
Yesterday the UN has proposed a plan to rebuild Cancun home lighting, lighting stores and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve the reduction of greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional restrictions that must be done to stabilize the planet's climate from now to 2020 ..
This ambitious plan is in the process of large concrete projects, which the UN wants to enforce in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of hard commitments to reduce the sale of the other industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, when the hot bulbs to monopolize yet 50-70% of the market, replacing bulbs fluokompaktními or, better yet, elektroluminiscentními bulbs with LEDs (DEL or "LED" in English), a significant amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) GES emissions on the planet incurred because of the lighting would blur.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, a large country with a significant share of emissions as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, engage in voluntary reduction plans which should allow a reduction in global emissions of GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be deducted from the balance sheet for 5 Gt to achieve the 2020 climate stabilization warming to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude that gets out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs with 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, ie 5%, the product is light.
With fluokompaktními bulbs reduces energy consumption by 75% and new bulbs with longer, reducing the consumption of more times.
Fluokompaktní bulb lasts on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
New light bulbs with longer, those who said this week the production of Philips - the company allegedly participated in the study of the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than-hot light bulb, which gives us an idea of ​​possible savings the compensation plan, which was applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And contain no mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations about fluokompaktním bulbs because they contain mercury and must be sorted as a hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless the producers have set up collection points.
However, as the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is fluokompaktní bulb, rather than coal burning power plants that emit a lot of mercury required to produce the electricity wasted in the incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States, these centers give the market 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also provides detailed benefits, which would result from this international program of each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plant, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of results of presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire following the expiration of deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission completed its work and immediately announced its preliminary results, said UN spokesman of the President."
"Requests all Ivorian parties and institutions to their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative to disclosure of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures some foreign governments had imposed electoral commission latest date - midnight Wednesday - without having to publish the results, three days after Sunday's scrutiny,.
About forty minutes before the deadline President of CEI on television confirmed that the commission "continues to work" in order to declare the results.
On Wednesday, the world multiplied appeals for CEI announced last name of the winner of the second round, among ceding Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member of Alassane Ouattara.
But Gbagbo camp relies on the nullification of the Constitutional Council for a "fraudulent" vote in the North, managed by former New Army rebels (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, has confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters, who practiced Hospital (New Army) in the north country, deter supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire there to go and vote.
Elections could be canceled if the Constitutional Council took into account the matters to which Mr Gbagbo.
But opponents of President Gbagbo have for that country's highest court is not neutral, because it manages N'Dré Paul Yao, a close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north, who denies any connection to former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far that craved victory.
His allies acknowledge that Gbagbo blocked publication of results because they know that they have suffered a loss and make a complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the Electoral Commission to broadcast the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections taking place on Sunday, was regarded as the coronation process of reconciliation and reunification of the country, which for years has been divided into two halves.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday a political faction of the Ivory Coast that could be held liable for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who won the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Case Clotilde Reiss: Élysée Palace exaggerated mediation Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Deal Klotildy Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spying," the united views of France, said in diplomacy and stressed the readiness of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All diplomats closely monitored by the United States.
U.S. documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde revealed some disadvantages of this crisis.
Describe how the Élysée Palace to explain his strategy to the Americans, while he went so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases hostages in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how the leading French officials tried to persuade Washington to release the young Frenchwoman was compensation against his release Kakavanda Majid, Iranians imprisoned in France, and sought justice for the American contraband trade in materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, subjected to bright light the way to the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar al-Assad, has played a central role in the liberation Klotildy Reiss.
In fact, for it did nothing.
Diplomatic cable written by 12 August 2009 in Paris, the headline: "Iran: French comments on how to resolve the case of the hostages."
Advisor of the Elysee Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richieri, accompanied by Director of the Quai d'Orsay North Afrikua Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with representative of U.S. diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend that Americans do as much for to be transported back to the homeland of their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise, he says," always strongly pronounced "in the media the words" basic human rights ,"" Innocence, "" immediate liberation ."
It is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in trouble, sensitive to their image.
"Do all the more so the more you will ask you to stop it."
Since the negotiation was attempted through discrete channels, "silence solves nothing, the Iranians are" masters with evasive maneuvers. "
Mr. Richieri notes that arrests of foreigners is "Iranian family tactic: taking of hostages for the purpose of" political blackmail ."
Indicates that the exemptions Klotildy Reiss (which occurs on August 16, the day it provides a refuge French embassy) will require payment of Iranians to the high sums of money (deposit € 230,000).
And reports that the Élysée Palace anticipates hostage cases, a phenomenon which "will become sharper."
Iranians should "in the future to arrest the other around 1800 French living in Iran," he says.
28th August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss has left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand that the United States claims that he was exiled for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, in Paris, released under a judge's decision.
U.S. embassy as well as many observers asking this disturbing consistency.
For Washington, that plagued the Iranian clandestine network for acquiring nuclear material intended for the program's expansion Majid Khakavanda bad news.
France agreed to haggle?
Iranian Liberation Liberation young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, 4 September, François Richieri assures that it is not.
Élysée Palace, as stated, was not "surprised by the judge," but looking for a way to stand against it.
"Talks were held between the presidency and minister of justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not alter the court's decision," he notes.
Mr. Richieri also wants to demonstrate that Kakavand Majid is the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
Adviser to the Elysee Palace dials a phone number, hanging up the telephone handset and then inform the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of imprisonment in Iran Klotildy Reiss Élysée Palace efforts to develop, negotiate, through communiqués and organized "leaks" to the media to convince Syrian President Bachar al-Assad had played a "significant" and "influential" role of "mediator."
Americans observe this activity and not without irony, and note that handling is bearing fruit, as some press articles reflect the official French version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 suggests the media "blest" French officers. "
So what constitutes such a degree of "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their full statements by French officials of praise in the privacy recognize that they have only a vague idea of ​​what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Élysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "is intended to validate the policies of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria," it analyzes.
The policy applied in 2008 "was regarded by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as untimely and undeserved."
Thus, "as Syria's role in exaggerating," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what praise can earn while playing a constructive role in the area."
It also aims "to sow discord between grain Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy is aware of a very good source.
11th August François Richieri, he confided: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians do something, whether it's anything"
"But we thank them."
"That should at least bring havoc and confusion among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returned to France 16th May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy it receives at the Elysee Palace.
In a press thank the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriots."
End of online games after midnight the young Koreans
The South Korean government adopts a law called "Peciválský," which will prohibit adolescents play online games after midnight, by obstructing access to, said government officials accountable.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to apply to companies operating online games by blocking access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years old, said officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning in school and unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this is necessary to make it possible to ensure their health and their right to sleep," the AFP said Jo Rin, vedoucí official at the ministry, which is in charge of the bill.
Online games will now be open from 6am.
Companies will have one year out to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, added the officer responsible.
It is also available to people who request it, free programs to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea has one of the most "affected" and a daily newspaper regularly provides various facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed world champion in the competition in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber ​​Games, and face to face with 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA lays the host country.
Full unrest due to suspicions of corruption down the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday host the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, selection of supremely politically motivated, where competition for influence and lobbying risk that outstrip the technical criteria.
Thing is certain, the Royal contest in 2018se Fifa will take place in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
Championships in 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hopes that she can conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) following the premiere on the African continent in 2010, and continue planting in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of celebrities taking part in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, government leaders of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) allows for a picture of scale economic and political stakes around the world.
Negotiations are at risk behind the scenes that will last until the last minute.
For the rest it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the evaluation report, Fifa documentation English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and U.S. (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons do not have too much weight to the 22 executive committee members at the hour designated for voting.
The Sunday Times in early detection, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE / European Commission? / For corruption (Reynald Temarii Amos Adamu et) maybe a chance to destroy his country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the World Cup only once a year.
BBC Monday put on the case in the Crown of the broadcast dokument, who "injected the pin" three influential members CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz a Issa Hayat.
How do Fifa disgruntled and bring trouble to the English leaders David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he can repeat the coup, which succeeded his predecessor in office Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to obtain for the London Olympics in 2012.
Will it be enough this intense activity to England, added new luster to his name at the CE (European Commission)?
Nothing is less certain, since the pair Spain-Portugal missing trumps already prepared stadiums, his opinions (the World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, ​​Euro 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries, could give the cold shoulder to these ambitions.
Any retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's position, which was the underdog despite gaps in the documentation (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided to not displace the Zurich Championship and publicly declared "unfair competition in preparation for the vote, a verbal cues hardly twisted the English press the allegations against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We're going to throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr Poutine.
For 2022 seem to be logical favorite United States with its considerable experience of 1994.
Highest performance in the world economy, principal sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country is way ahead of Japan and South Korea, separately, produced a beautiful project.
But these candidates seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002, went through a "test."
Another threat: the granting of the World Cup China 2026, which he fervently hopes Fifa has made a chance for the Asian 2022 invalid.
In Qatar, which drew a great ace from his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries represent more risk than securities.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for a TV flimsy charges (due to time-shift) paid by European countries, forming a powerful force for Fifa.
Second Mandate: conspicuity (security)
De Gaulle's really hesitated.
Mitterrand appearance aroused, he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they do.
Mandate Elysejskému palace calling someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
However, conspicuity is in good agreement with a share of the mystery associated with the functions of the presidency.
It is to be done, as it always doubts persisted.
In one well in the second sense.
In 2006, without so wanted to believe, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed to be the third mandate has not been excluded.
15th November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy has assured that "decides sometime in the fall of 2011.
As recalled before the UMP parliamentarians on Wednesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two terms" sow a little feverish state.
It's official announcement of his candidacy?
Not far from it.
The president merely reiterated that the adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 reduced the number of five-year terms to two.
It was the only of its finding that no notice.
It's not the first time at such meetings, recalls the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you've got another seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Do you not consider that the next stage."
His remarks předvčerejší it does not make a candidate more than the previous day, does not make him a candidate no less.
If comments raise is due to the double truth.
Accelerating the path to candidacy in PS, on the one hand.
But it does not enter the arena Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing you to be convicted.
Contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012, it is evident that many in the PS organization wants to combat premature reports rather than intended.
Poor research on the other.
First, voters would prefer right kandidaturu François Fillon, Nicolas Sarkozy before kandidaturou (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and does not discuss the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and wary of the people closest to the Prime Minister.
"If we believe can defeat, will not stand," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"We will believe they could win," Alain Juppé fixes, balance the obviousness.
Euro: European Central Bank was forced to continue their purchases of state titles.
The last session of the Governing Council in Central had an opportunity to explain the conditions for removal from the crisis, or at least notification of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt commits the Institute for the issuance of securities will undoubtedly can not afford to be so categorical pain worsening situation now so tight on European securities markets.
The political costs would in this case was all the greater.
Yesterday a press conference on the occasion of the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde pay tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in the debt crisis for European countries.
She did not say whether he thought that the Bank could do more, for example, that the program increased their purchases of sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my account of my European partners (...) ."
The evening before, in Brussels, during his interrogation by the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, has proved výřečnější with regard to his intentions, and contented himself with it, stating that purchase program state title on the secondary market, "continues" and that "we'll see how we decide" during the meeting, which takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will watch its base interest rate constant at 1%, its lowest ever level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds made by the European Central Bank in the last week doubled to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks to market irrationality brokers yesterday made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks bought for 67 billion from May 2010.
Among the dealers in the market anticipating a continuation of the purchases do not allow any doubt (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change of course.
If the lending operations in more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, sees this latter bank to unlimited provision of liquidity under generous terms and the duration from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for several months.
"I can not imagine that would significantly alter its program."
"If not, it would take short-term risk of inducing new tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"Progressive basis reported in the first quarter of 2011 seems likely, anticipating Norbert Brams, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
The plan their interventions in the market for public debt, "would have the European Central Bank to maintain its volume of purchases of bonds to revitalize dull market," added Norbert Brams.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area has continued to choose anything other than to maintain their market presence.
"He needs at any cost to fill the gap in the market and investors act in such a way as to prevent an outbreak of paid performances States belonging to the most fragile, testified last substantial bond manager.
Because if interest rates took off, the states will be even more worrying, in order to reduce its debt, instead it stabilized.
It is the salvation of the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government cowers back
After beginning the week in Italy is a worrying situation relaxed a little, yesterday reflux bond interest over 10 years.
Return to a temporary standstill.
At the end of the meeting with the prime minister for the economy of the regions said they had heard of Giulio Tremontiho how the situation qualifies as "nerozřešitelnou" and expects "unpredictable" weekend, which then denied which are not parties.
In any event, on Tuesday, deviation from the long German interest reached a record 210 basis points and the contract price to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points, which in Rome caused some excitement.
The Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi said that the deviation in Spain with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, has stated that it is "too busy" stormy market developments "and a possible infection originating from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro-zone economy is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that as Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and without encryption, the problem is the lack of growth and lackluster fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand, exposing it to become the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest projections for the government of Brussels has a cold shower.
Italy's growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 to 1.4% in 2012 ... while the budget that is available to the Senate for his analysis, at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the fame of new accessories for the whole state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, at 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, they will have to be adopted strict new measures, assesses the economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy in order and the calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Administrative Board of the International Monetary Fund, under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short or long, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR) is required to stabilize in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There remains the question of political instability.
14th December, the Minister Silvio Berlusconi to face motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and then after that could begin to organize elections, which are expected at the end of March.
It started would be a period, less appropriate for a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans have demonstrated Sunday throughout the day and night, are obviously extremely committed to solidarity, committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday observed expansion of the European public interest on the bonds, brought water to the mill of the governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can still talk about the beginning of normalization.
Office of notation Standard & Poor's announced that it would degrade the record of the debt of Portugal, the goals to which the main focus of various speculations.
"Because May is a real lack of transparent and clear policy, involving in particular the banking system," says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
The more that the "political time runs slower than the time to market."
Aware of this decoupling and dangers which may arise, intensify the discussion of European countries, to strengthen existing mechanisms crisis.
Informal consultations between the ministers of finance, most affected by the problem, and more broadly with their counterparts from the G20 is going very well.
And in view of the Eurogroup meeting (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group since the beginning of next week.
European Central Bank meeting takes place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support the euro area, focusing on markets (see above).
As regards the European Finance Fund (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus REGLING, zapořčal Tuesday in Singapore tour Asia, in order to inform investors from the Far East by developing crisis in Europe.
If this trip is to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of securities FESF is expected next month.
Yesterday the official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States will support any increase in additional funds mobilized through direct engagement in the FMI.
The country, which is primarily, Portugal and Spain are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, particularly as regards the organization of the labor market.
The reforms, which are attached to the stringent measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid the other way than that used in Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid at all costs that would have asked for international assistance before applying correctives its own budget and decide before the structural reforms necessary to regain a permanent trust.
Participants in the European capital funds finally talking about options, available to accelerate the process of normalization with the sovereign bond markets.
During his trip to Paris 24th November Axel Weber came up with the idea that not enough mobilized 750 billion euros across Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to reach for the supply of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is the actor the very first business plan with the European sovereign claims, concluded that the addition of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, "rather" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
Remedy exists: it is the mechanism of the European financial stability, which had by that date 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has all chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.

Grand Paris Metro: the first financial proposals
Since the discussion on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France in full swing, it's raining billion.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular, 23 billion to metro Grand Paris, which is built by the Société du Grand Paris.
The fact that this construction could be started, the state announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
Purely theoretically this is the amount that the company will use the SGP to contracts to be financed by its dual sources.
Today, finally we get to the first additions.
Rectification by the Finance Act of 2010, which examines the financial committee of the National Assembly this morning, has established mechanisms to ensure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and increase the tax office on the Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "in favor of public institutions of the Société du Grand Paris.
It is enumerated: "The proceeds from such interest is 117 million per year.
The second is the reconstruction rate for offices that already exists, "to be modernized to increase the income derived from it, and that this increase is affected by the Société du Grand Paris.
How much would it earned?
Mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
By far we have 4 billion.
"It is stated that the fiscal resources are attached to the 4 billion euros of capital grants, which will be mobilized and inserted into the state of the Société du Grand Paris under the project," we read the explanation.
We at the SGP, the system does not seem shocking.
"From the moment we generated revenue (both tax ndlr), the study may cover a period of three years and then grab at up to 4 billion, is explained here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as needed.
SGP The Company believes that the 4 billion will be credited to the 2013 budget for 2014.
This mechanism, which promised four billion subscribers are still absent, it risks to cause a rather busy parliamentary debate.

Vengeful hackers and spies imitators
WikiLeaks Case has a double significance.
On the one hand, revealed an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, shows the profound changes at the international level, and anticipates the future by regression.
But do first things first.
WikiLeaks first aspect, it is testimony to the fact that each document drawn up by the Secret Service (any nation) consists solely of print cuts.
"Special revelation" Americans on sexual behavior Berlusconi reported what he has for months to read all those of any of the newspapers (all but two of Berlusconi's own), and the infamous cartoon Kadafi's profile has been long for a theme to the cabaret artist sketches ..
The rule, according to secret documents which may consist of only reporting what is already known, the fundamental dynamics of the secret services not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that is dedicated to the esoteric literature, you will see that every work of repeats (the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Knights Templar and Freemasons) exactly what has been written in previous works.
And not just because the author of occult texts do not like searching for new information (or know where to look for news about non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult believe only what they already know and what confirms what they already learned .
This mechanism is Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) chief of secret services (and if not, it could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération), who considered true only what he himself admits.
Information with high secrecy of Berlusconi, the U.S. embassy sent a state department, were the same, which Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, about the revelations about the documents he had made so much fuss?
On the one hand say what any sophisticate knows, namely that the embassy, ​​at least since the Second World War and since you can call or heads of state aircraft to fly in the evening, he lost his diplomatic position and, with the exception of a few small representation in the exercise were transformed in the spy center.
Any viewer watching movies on the investigation very well knows that only the self-righteousness is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that it repeats publicly decry the hypocrisy and the obligation it casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get strictly classified information, the most powerful country in the world is a tough blow, but not negligible, for the prestige of the state sector.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executor."
But then move on to a deep truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell, it was possible to hold all the power, like a Big Brother controlling every movement of their people.
Orvellovo prophecy has been shown since, what with the ability to monitor every movement by phone, each executed transaction, visited the hotel, used by the highway, and so on, became a full citizen of casualties can rim.
But when we demonstrate how it works now, that even the "tomb" with the most secret information the powerful can not resist the intervention of a hacker no longer control the message and becomes a one-way circular.
Power checks every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can retain the power that is no longer able to keep their own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has stated that the real secret is unsubstantial secrets (unsubstantial mystery will never be revealed), it is also true that all the information about the nature of Berlusconi and Merkel is indeed mysterious bezobsažným secret because it is pulled from public life , but to reveal, as did WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton was the secret of secrets bezobsažnými means withdraw him all the power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake at the Merkel and Sarkozy, but made by something big Clinton and Obama.
What are the implications of this wound uštědřené power so important?
It is obvious that in the future will not be able to send online sensitive information - it would be tantamount to its publication on the poster stuck to the street corner.
But it is also quite clear that current technology is useless to hope that it can maintain the confidentiality of messages over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to determine if and when the head of state travel by plane and has teamed with some of his colleagues.
How can in future be kept confidential in the private and sensitive messages?
Well I know that for the moment the forecast is to the science-fiction and it is fantastic, but I imagine the government officials who are transported discreetly to complete the formalities after uncontrollable routes and carry them only those messages that you know by heart, or rather hiding rare information in the heel of the shoe.
Information will be maintained in unique copies in the drawers closed key: Taken together, attempted espionage at the Watergate scandal had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write, that technology is now moving forward, sideways, backwards, ie.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, Internet-based rehabilitated telegraph wires (telephone).
Videotapes (analog) allow cinema lovers shoot the film step by step, move it back and forth to reveal all the secrets of mounting, and now a CD (digital) allows only bound by chapter, that is, after makroporcích.
Through high-speed drive from Rome to Milan for three hours, while air travel and transportation, which includes need three and a half hours.
Not so extraordinary, that the policy and communication technology to return to the wagons drawn by horses.
One last note.
Sometimes the press tried to understand what was engineered in a secret embassy.
Now the embassy to request confidential information from the press.
Climate: both France Hackl its promises on financing
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to try keeping promises to rapidly unlocked financing (financing with stated fast start (fast start) or premature), implemented by developed countries.
A large French hacks are detected
The Copenhagen agreement with the developed countries agreed to provide $ 30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, and France 1.26 billion euros (ie 420 million per year).
At the opening of the EU COP16 drew big ace in order to convince its partners of the feasibility of its commitment to finance a fast start: a report specifying the action of its Member States, press conferences, grand side event, the distribution of pamphlets ...
Transparent operation priceless and valued at its true value: the developed countries and civil society would want them all developed countries and civil society were equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announced that in 2010 released 2.2 million of which has left it the right way to comply with its pledge 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are more complicated.
These funds are under the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that there is an increased burden implemented without detriment to the public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what constitutes a "new and additional."
While the European Commission has proposed harmonizing, some Member States, among them France, the process is blocked.
Today, everyone can choose the reference, which suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, regarded as a benchmark for 2009: international funding, and she survived it only adds 150 million three-year funding titulu fast start.
Other countries chose similar references to the annual payment dates or the dates on the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France considers that funding for "all new projects" for 2010 is' new and additional ."
In other words, no references to expenditure for the previous period, or global level of public aid for development d'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of aid to developing countries to France can remain unchanged (or even lower), has kept his commitment to funding for "new and additional '...
Another crucial element is the distinction between gifts and loans.
There still exists a rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, like France, considering that 1 € loan equal to 1 € a gift.
Apparently it's proven difficult: it is not, comparable efforts.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments that are profitable (often for projects related to reducing emissions, resulting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro, we get, as the equivalent of one euro, which we ... We should not be understood by virtue of their commitment, but as the price of borrowing for the creditor country (ie the equivalent interest rate).
But France may make a justification of such "respects" its commitment of 420 million makes it a 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36.1 million) - see document EU to get it to yourself to verify.
It is the only EU countries that use this scale loan.
Germany then the required 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to meet their commitments to 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union will give € 1 to the satisfaction of its promises, but France only 10 cents and sees the effort as comparable.
Tumbler Beautiful piece!
To summarize, when considering funding "Fast Start" France operates two šejdířstvím: on the one hand with the development of events in time and on the other side with a real financial burden.
Although spends only 36.1 million euros, can see that gives 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to their promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (since it appears that although this is Bercy, who was such a decision) could have a double negative impact, while intra-EU (why should the Member States to continue donating, if you just borrow?) And in negotiations, as development countries are not completely naive ...
Chapter Early funding is little otázečkou relatively short in relation to a series of discussions on climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in a vast machine, moreover, such as the UNFCCC.
Hopefully it will not be our case.
Whether it's whatever is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France had to announce a change in its method of keeping accounting records for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations of fairness and justice and to other European Union countries.
But above all, France would have avoided discussion of long-term deposits to finance (the other major section is currently under discussion): inescapable question of 'additionality' method of accounting or loans.
France should change its position to become the pokrokářská these deposits, like the others.
All hope is inserted into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizetové arriving in Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement a fast start France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could cause an increased level of international confidence necessary to be able to move forward in discussions.
Alarm about the pesticides that children consume.
Devour a child of one of 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday, the association of future generations (ex-Movement for Rights and preservation for future generations).
Association, which states that its results "do not have a significant statistical value to the small number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the mentioned problems, bought between July and September of foods commonly consumed four meals and a snack as a light snack for a child about ten supermarkets in Paris and l'Oise.
The typical dishes, including an official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed in the research laboratories of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance of the plates is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are among the carcinogens, possible or probable, and five agents are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances which could act as disruptive to the internal gland excretion (PE), according to studies of several institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even though in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical received individually are not exceeded, in our research, I can see that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and / or PE is striking," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea containing themselves about ten residues with the potential carcinogenic effects, and three proved to be a certain carcinogens, as well as for about twenty residues, which could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, the studies reported a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including banned in France antifungal agent.
The same is true for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, where the study found strong traces of insecticides banned in the EU.
Moreover steak minced meat, canned tuna and even the bun and gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
Salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" to the 34 discovered residues of chemical analysis, and even plastic plates used for heating food in a microwave oven to avoid the analysis.
A final risk to consumers of the "cocktail of contaminants is probably underestimated, resulting from the study.
Ecological Society Green-Europe (EE-LV) suggested "in the face of an emergency situation," establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "rise of civilization diseases."
In July study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the status of residues identified 365 different pesticides in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
