Lack of snow on the mountains has bedeviled the hotel owners
Make Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn not only the giant mountains-local residents.
The lack of snow will deter people from appointment of Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, one can get in Giant still free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go to the offers by the prices, but now they are afraid to order mandatory.
And if they call us to ask them immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "Matsch" will be led by the operators of the information Spindl.Info portal, Martin Jandura.
Who the New Year's Eve-stay in the Spindelmühle exactly in his opinion, should no longer hesitate with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly for the Silvestertag only weeks stints at.
I think that they are still for a while will seek to sell these, but they must also give in and respond to shorter hours.
And then the free rooms will be quickly languishing Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are interested in most of the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have already had some cheaper Christmas visits prepared for the very last moment, the director of the Ingtours travel agents, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can also offer the Vrchlabi-travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Find good (the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter visits also negatively affected that no snow lies in Giant.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should be the Pisten within a week verschneit, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than in last year to fill the room in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five per cent better than in the previous year.
On Silvestertag and at Christmas, we have only a few free room.
Great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, the deal will also run well-informed the Director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada.
To 80 percent for the New Year's Eve visits is also the Omnia Hotel in the central car park filled in Janske Lazne.
However, remains at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now the February, but at the very moment when the snow comes, heightens the interest in the periods spent in Giant, the director of the Omnia hotels, Erik Sporysch.
Waiting for a greater snow mess the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it should cool and in the event of rainfall, that should be on the mountains of snow.
But then again a warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
US: repetition is the mother of the intelligence
It is almost funny how Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor, repeatedly in the issue of Afghanistan, which he himself felt for the Dümmsten.
When he finally his eagerly-awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he abschrieb this on the Kopierpapier from the Bush-Iraq Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only that he used in the text itself several times, the saying goes, "as in Iraq," he has used the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new Vorwärtsweg" without having to come off the fence.
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in Iraq tormented by the civil war to send - as "irresponsible and in its conclusions trophic Karas criticised decision."
Subsequent months but showed that the recommendations of the military Bush strategy, the only possible and in that respect was very successful, that in today's news about Iraq no longer speaks.
The Bush's reputation has not improved, because he has objectively his successor a much dankbarere starting position behind, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have again asked the military, especially the Oberkommandeur the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten the vacillating - gunman harshly criticized in the White House.
He called for 40000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President was reluctant for three months, but has come at a better idea, and so he has betrayed the General wenistens about 10000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise of a further 5000, even if he originally with at least 10000 expected.
Highly problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process to be completed within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved topping the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders pay tribute to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the counter-indication - on a second one can leave and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correct founded only remain licence buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations will proliferate.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "viable state", which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years has worsened the situation in Afghanistan only, and now she is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers who broke out into the bellicose language on the " Frühheimkehr ' create a miracle, can only be a truly romantic soul, which is not impressed by the facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of troops sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents, in what way the German or Italian security with the war in Hindukusch-mountain Vorland.
Another possible factor which can affect the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
Should not the situation continues to deteriorate and the increasing sanctions on the Iranians, is a very serious issue for the United States, if not to solve the problem with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America after Obama the winner is withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left before the presidential election and, therefore, there is still plenty of time, so that he can use a different strategy, fallls these prove to be a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no more premiums bonuses in cash
The chief executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs to receive no bonuses this year more bonuses in cash.
The company has announced that the response to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive instead of money stock, but it was only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the stock of the managers can be withdrawn in the event when they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of the effort to link the premium bonuses Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think that Wall Street is aware of the wider direction, in which she has led the former banker society JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made itself a target of criticism after she had for the first three quarters of this year, almost 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses set aside.
The total amount of bonuses premiums in the course of this Jahra is likely after the Reuters news agency also despite the today reported to exceed $20 billion measure.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector with the onset of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to burden the bonuses of the bankers, the 25000 pound exceed unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have the prizes won in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have taken in Stockholm today from the hands desKönigs of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel prizes in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists was under the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize for medicine have received two American Biologinnen, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the Chromosonen-area.
The prize for chemistry has been the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin loaned the Nobel Prize for economics, the American-born wife Elinor Ostrom and her fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for economic analysis of the report.
The only specialist category, in which no woman in this year, received a Nobel Prize in Physics.
This prize today, the scientists have Charles Kao for research in glass fibre-area and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for CCD-chip invention, which forms the basis of all Digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical television piping.
Each prize has the diploma, which Nobelmedaile and obtain a certificate on the purchase of the monetary prize.
The amounts in each category of 10 million Swedish kronor.
If in every category, there are several prize winners, the price of money will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, the most anticipated Nobel peace prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech he has recognised the Kontrovere his appointment, because it is only at the beginning of his journey, and, moreover, is at the head of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of his policy, he added, however, that wars in certain situations are necessary for the Erkämpfen of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister is considering Janota resignation. Klaus has invited him into the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning, the finance minister, Eduard Janota who thinks about his continued presence in the government, because it goes against the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form of this by the Assembly on Wednesday was released, does not agree.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also be criticised by Klaus.
According to him is the budget deficit, which deepened the crisis in public finances.
On the meeting of Presidents informed spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On its future remain in his post wants Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the Budget Act, which now Klaus to sign, economies of the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament were increased but on Wednesday, on the Left Party proposals on monetary upheaval and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has kept the proposals of social democracy, that it covers increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the Fischer-pays official cabinet, on the organisation of the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures practically liquidated by the fishermen- Government in the autumn were not enforced, and that it understood the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not today declared at the time of the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have been neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is not a good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still could rely on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The UDF leader, Mirek Topolanek, led on, that the budget is absolutely atrocious, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
The ODS-deputy chairman, Petr Necas, the CTK said that the concept of the Staff cabinet with the support of the CSSD ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a "strong Aussprüche."
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek-words, that the budget deficit is totally atrocious that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD evaluating the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint East Wood of Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood film " Invictus: the Ungeschlagene ' the world much of the country shows from its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was filled by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race relations and on Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the Southern African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einund ninety years of Mandela, whether he might represent him in the East Wood- film.
Another meaningful role Matt Damon.
I said to him: " if I am going to play you, I must take you.
The seventy-year-old actor, who is the price for his role in the East Wood-drama from the Boxbereich ' million dollar baby "had received, already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end for slave owners has become a fictional US president, and God in" Evan Allmächtig ', but rarely does someone who is still alive, and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the Southern African Republic for 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and that is at the same time, the name of a Gedichtes of the English writer William Ernest Henley, which has been published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a real event, at the Nelson Mandela finished his forces with the captain of the South African rugby teams, Francois Pienaar, to some of the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still race remains legally and economically divided.
He believes that he can be a few people through sport, so he decides to agree the rugby players around the world to the outsiders.
Finally, the South African team is growing up in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years, in order to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role so this reality as closely as possible to come closer, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, with him to dinner and before his speech to be behind the scenes.
That was most important for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have noticed when I give you a hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar for erstenmal in his house.
I remember when I was in the Türklingel rang that he opened and the first thing I to François Pienaar in my life, said: ' In the film, I see a lot more from '.
Despite the apparent differences in the stature of the actor in comparison with their actual role models, he has received under the guidance of director East Wood "Invictus: ungeschlagen" positive reviews and also talks about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety newspaper, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "this was a very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the film reviews on the Web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light mystery dissolved on Norway: the Russians have tested a missile
On Norway was a special light to observe effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch, but was not successful and which should be as Type "Bulava" rocket, which was originally the pride of the Russian army is slowly into a nightmare of Russian Generalität and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground on the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not launched or damaged in the air.
Writes in Russian newspapers on "Bulava" than a "missile not flies."
A missile, which do not, however, stands to
This already 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight appeared again technical damage to the rocket.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third stage rocket.
This time, "launched Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp allows the shooting down of the submarine.
It is therefore likely that caused by an unspecified fliegendes object mysterious light on North because really damaged "Bulava was."
Furthermore, the Norwegians since the first moment did not doubt that we are talking about a Russian rocket.
The Generalität has diesesmal opposed and claims that it cannot properly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell, not out and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, however, have damaged the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without mistakes, holds the chairmanship of the Ministry of Defence only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success, therefore, will bear the Generalität with optimism and will continue to claim that the "Bulava" even without problems flying and even ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.3 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed with 51 years an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov arises again, with 51 years ago in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holders - helps his team CSKA Moscow in an emergency, and is probably already in Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his career with 40 years ago, in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defensive players.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player is only a game.
I believe that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, players Nemcinov led on.
If Fetisov comes back to the Eisfläche, he will be the oldest AP Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL has played the legendary striker Gordie Howe with einund 50 years a whole season for durum Ford and has 15 hits and 26 Assistenzen benefit letter.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.

In the second part of his career he collected also successes in the NHL, where he stressed in the Detroit-Dress twice the Stanley Cup over the head.
Since 2001, he is a member of the Ice Hockey-star rooms.
Hyundai was the unions after all overtime lifted
The management of Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
Because often Medicines overtime has announced the union on Monday's strike.
It confirmed the spokesman of the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
The management wants but still with the trade unionists agree on a Samstags class this week.
We must not abandon our manufacturing plan, which is a principle that was therefore proposed on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime for the reason that two working classes would be worked Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company's staff, which would work Samstags class, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff also retrospectively for the Samstags layer of 28 November.
Vanek, according to the company has decided to change the Motivierungsart of staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they can afford to pay the overtime pay or they can take for that replacement holidays on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas festivities Vanek led on.
In addition, paid all the staff of the Samstags class fares and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime the dearest and most burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of trade unionists were suspended last week, the production had decided the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, led to Vaněk.
The staff of the automobile factory were until last week, have been forced to work almost every day after the Achtstundenschicht 2 overtime.
After signing the agreement of the strikes will revoke willingness on the part of the trade unions.
Rest of negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and trade unionists on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they agree to meet the demands and can sign a joint document, they would be willing to lift the strike.
The situation in the car factory has deteriorated sharply last week, on Wednesday, when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went for permanent overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The board found that the staff overtime to comply with the car-supply needs.
The trade unionists demanded in its Monday-Streikbereitschaftsausrufung, too, that the staff who have interrupted the production last Wednesday, with no penalties are imposed.
In the field of overtime call for the unions to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for this year to pay the salary of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Mass production was launched in the company in November of last year.
Until this September have been manufactured here around 80000 vehicles, the current production capacity of 200000 vehicles a year.
Czech discovery: a substance, which is also ' tempered like " HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds that block the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that he also works with the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus-variants not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug can prolong position but life and the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
But their income is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete oppression of the viral reproduction also has the development sg. Resistent viruses result against no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts of the three institutions of the Academy of Science CR, from the VSCHT (Chemisch-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way, as one might with the virus-resistant.
They have proven that as Metalokarborane substances on the protein substance, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV Viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the virus-reproduction in other ways than all today used drugs, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new "enhanced" compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein substance.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor-fuel, hydrogen and carbon-atoms and through a metal-nuclear, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and resistant virus
HIV protease protein substance is the HIV virus, which is vital to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus through the HIV protease division would not mature Infektionsvirenpartikel.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we follow the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers explain in the press report, which was issued by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Science CR.
In the work, which was published in the scientific newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole rows of compounds in which two couples of cages (see table) are accompanied by a brief organic chain, which is then systematically further changes.
Slightly weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV protease wurdne tested on reacto glass, even against its steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV-infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme-variant is not as strong as the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effects on the Resistent variants, against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique effective mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low Giftigkeit and the possibility of further chemical impact, the Metalokarboranen makes interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines against HIV research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Science.
Dispute because budget. ODS went wrong on fishermen, who are fighting
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider his opinion, their continued existence.
The statement described the ODS's prime minister as a "strong Aussprüche."
It is supposedly time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS-chair, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Staff cabinet with the support of the CSSD ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas must decide the Prime Minister whether he intends to rely on Parliament in the minority when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is about his continued presence in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas pointed out.
The House on Wednesday approved the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party-amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has increased the proposals of social democracy, that it covers the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has fulfilled before the vote left the room, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget of provisional arrangements. Frase not clear
Frustration and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were approved, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has registered Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has indicated that he will be deliberate yet another stay in office.
The reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent fishermen for the continued battle with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Necas Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget had nothing to do in the government.
The Premier also should make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to deficit-enhancing laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the services law should be changed.
Topolanek: the nominated by ODS ministers were wrong, not
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistake, Topolanek has emphasised in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function, who are trying to commit TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen in favour decides to give up the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament".
He then allegedly with the support and tolerance of citizens cannot count on Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be timely, then I shall look into this matter, said the defence minister nominated by the Civic Democratic Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister, back
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS, probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of citizens Democrats would expressly ask that they allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not little children, as he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament, and not in the Czech Republic has been pushed back.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that it would go in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positives, Topolanek reacted itself.
Under the new timetable for the CD (Czech Railways) less trains for roughly the same fare.
The Czech Railways stopped or restricted from 13 December some less closing its rapid and local trains, other links will be strengthened.
The whole transport volume will be reduced from the Gültigkeitstag's new road map in comparison with today at two percent.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several liaison possibilities in the capital, for example, the residents of Ostrava area, the railways for this line trains of the type Pendolino.
The train is no longer after Bratislava (former Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be reduced by the wayside Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle, be the direct links from Prague after Letohrad.
The biggest reduction plans the railways in the district of Hradec Kralove (King Graz), overall by eight percent, on an increase can look against Prague and surrounding areas.
Be lifted two night trains on the route from Prague Tabor - Budweis and on some days during the week of the operation of some fast trains on the route from Prague Pisek Budweis - reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new Direktverkehrsweges from oblige Vice about to Prague, now have to switch the inhabitants of oblige Vice about in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening, thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem after oblige Vice about is possible.
The television long distances in the capital will end up in the Objective station Prague - main railway station.
The CD will lead more lines of communication SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk/Jesenik in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December, no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Department of Transport, they generally receives the railways to reimburse the so-called liquidity loss over the next year, four billion kronor, genaus as this year. Local trains provide districts, overall pay into next year, eight billion kronor, while the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains has completed the railways a ten-year contract, until now the Treaty was just completed for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps she has not resorted to increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
It is changed just in one network ticketed CD Net and favourable eLiska Internet ticketed.
For passengers without the customer card will increase the price of CD Net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then from the frozen Stecke depend, until now, it was claimed for travel between any district towns uniformly and 160 kroner.
Philippine Mr aunt take more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Mr aunt today kidnapped in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some basic pupils and their teachers.
This has led the AFP Agency initially only about 65 Entführte informed.
All 17 children held have been freed after eight hours, including a teacher.
On the abduction occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Roughly 19, Mr aunt allegedly used the hostages as a live shield on the run from the police.
The local negotiators are now committed to the publication of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency include Mr aunts to Neuvolksarmee (NPA), this is the arms group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police, the kidnappers because of the violence, the revenge actions between the two local Famillienclans demanded.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, was imposed because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed, the state of law.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, with the election Gouverneuramt went 30 journalists.

The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood movie Clint East Woods in American cinema "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene", the part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was already a few years ago, allegedly by Mandela himself eye.
The supporting players role of the legendary South African champions in rugby, Francois Pienaar, Matt Damon has received.
With the movie launch of the film will also be reactions from critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
With whole name, he says Rolihlaha Nelson Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar-price, then in 1993, along with de Klerk's Nobel Peace Prize.
As President of the Republic of South Africa, he was elected in 1994 and 1999.
A great deal from the film, because it comes at a time in the cinema, in which culminate in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time, the media world opinion with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency are the responses to the new film in South Africa for the moment, invariably positive, despite numerous reservations about the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is its own words still proud of the new film.
I have many years of this role gives Gert and have been well prepared.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can watch it reiterates its energy, he led in the interview after the Festspielpremiere of cinema in Los Angeles.
I think that it is a good thing if this film with the personality errinern Mandela and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects each person, he added.

The film is based on the book presentation of the British writer John Carlin freely translated "in the role of the enemy": Nelson Mandela and the game that has united people, continues to portray the South African defender of human rights within its first president Wahlperiode.
Morgan Freeman sought in the course of the film, two races and each other for years delineated bring communities together and, as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also won in its role in the Southern African nation-Rugbydress at World Cup field, then South Africa.
For entering the lawn in the Dress, almost in South Africa is like a sacred act, Mandela ernte fourteen years ago big standing ovation, mostly by white audiences and has won the recognition of the white population.
The full Rugby Cup it was perhaps the people turn into a single nation to unite the rugby players Chester Williams, who in 1995, the only "black" in the national team.
Whether to improve the tense situation in South Africa, that will be seen.
The white South Africans but are sceptical, such as, for example, in a recent interview with the UAA rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, betrayed, fled the country after the United Kingdom.
The Championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency collects Radim Jancura today complaint for libel against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district Südmähren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute Inteview radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the efforts of the company, the regional rail traffic in certain districts.
All regions have signed but at the end of the long-term contracts with the Czech Writers Railway.
All three of us head and say that we take the cherry, we have put forward the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech railways, which were completed last week.
So there is nothing else than to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura radio Journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all counties that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek keeps the collection of the complaint for the continuation of the Medial ploy by Jancura him as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I also call for further head on.
I assume that, even in this matter will be clear that it is Jancura used in the cause of Regionaleinsenbahnverkehrs manipulated public opinion and false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had several million kronor in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts.
The Radio Journal he said that he wants to continue with the campaign after Christmas cut off, and these after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the wards at the behest of the regional rail transport agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a High 150 billion kronor had no invitations to tender.
After Vancura is such behaviour unlawful and inconsistent with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the counties threatened him, according to Jancura, already a Member of the CSSD.
Was the only threat, if we do not refrain from that, then we can also lose the Buslizenzen.
He was a Member of the CSSD, I know who they are, his name, I am not saying today said the radio Jancura Journal.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January this Gewohnte.
It should be the first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now voices are that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The medicine institute already sets the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also on the Impfungs procedures.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August-children
From January can be vaccinated children free of charge against Pneumokokken, born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition st that they do not yet have received vaccine dose.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be made between the 3 and 5th month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
As a whole, the experts that the health insurance for the vaccination doses between 300000 and 450000 kroner per year.
But they save in the treatment, which would need the children without vaccination.
Until now, has spent the state for all land vaccination of children around 500000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken cause Mittelohrentzündung, but also serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die after investigation in hospitals per year for up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic has the duty to vaccinate children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be duty?
At the same time, it is said that the vaccine could be in the future.
From January this will be paid by insurance and be voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Mr Rudolf Kalovsky.
Publicising its reunification already in the long term for the Pneumokokken-vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, which was involved in our association, were not very pleased that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the path we must now go Kalovsky led.
The Ministry of Health but does not want to change the vaccination proceedings against Pneumokokken.
At this moment, we are considering not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical children doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then we could reflect on the reduction of Wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents of their infants against Pneumokokken onwards to inoculate next year.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that this first ring-vaccination is paid by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
But that is a concern of the practical children doctors, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project vaccines should be bought by insurers and doctors then received in the same way as other state of vaccines they spent.
Some Members but feared that the insurance so "the money from the health care could lead."
That is why the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and must wait until the insurance they pay.
According to the estimates of the individual GPs per month must invest 40000 kronor, which is a significant amount of money.
This will not be easy, Cabrnochova says.
Still, they and we
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss electorate voted in favour of a ban on building for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report written about whether Muslims in one of the erklärtermaßen säkularisiertesten societies can be integrated into Europe — and integrated.
Some readers of this new book from admiration for the last station of the author: "why the French love no scarves" (original title: "why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) read an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, which divided the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible.
Book neustes Bowens offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now offer the 5-6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free spaces."
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)?
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and gay rights?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
It is permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanen affairs, he claims, which represent the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas examined by the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known names, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed Bowen, are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia in – nowadays a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He queries whether French policy makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate guarded the separation of church and state) really pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may find rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism.
He sees more of a "tightening of values" as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say ' yes, but not yet. "

The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice, which they can survive, is melting at an alarming rate and takes lives with this anywhere else.

Marines were among the 6000, the Arlington placed wreaths laid down their
The Obergefreite De ' Angello Robinson went seven hours with the bus in order to establish a single wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other marines, which took the journey from Camp Johnson in Jackson Ville, North Carolina, the National cemetery Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, they are in their footsteps.
In a few months, from where we are returned, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like to see someone would do the same thing for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, in order to establish placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-peaceful station.
Morrill Worcester, holder of the manufacturer's funeral wreath in Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992, this tradition when he and some others decided to dekorieren, several hundred graves at the cemetery Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, which are devoted to this trip each year take hold in various cities along the path in order to organise events, the people in the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed wreaths across America), the event has also extended to other states.
In this year, more than 16000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery in areas at the Pentagon on graves of National cemetery Fayette Ville in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time, more than 150000 dollars for purchase and transport of placed wreaths.
Char Leen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers.
Although her husband is not buried Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way, which give something back to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we civilians are able to support our troops.
It is as the visit of a family burial ground.
Wrapped in elevations warmer clothes migrated volunteers across the vast lawn land and peaceful hills of the station.
The volunteers had older graves from 1 and 2 world war and the Vietnam War as an objective, because they are not as often as the newer graves visited, the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while they wore the fresh pine branches on the grey-growing grave stones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, which was pinned on the upper part.
Section 60, which is located in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations totaling 1000 placed wreaths to dress this section, but the gloom of the current wars met this area.

Contractor of the US government by Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban Government has a contractor of the US government, mobile phones and note book-computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which until now has not yet been identified, is working for Development alternative, Inc. with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States representation in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban nationals or a foreign visitors for almost everything, arrested under the accusation of the "threat".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, suggest a arrests of risk.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who frequently describes how she and her husband from government representatives are persecuted and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had a "slow" approach to the improvement of relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night at the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States to provide a return if the Cuban government is taking concrete steps in that direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Cell phones and note Books, distinguished legally in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government only allows ordinary citizens since this year the purchase of a mobile phone, they are used skin irrelevant for the sending of text messages, since a 15-minütiges telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect often have to notify the government of their names.
Too many websites is restricted access.
Cuba is rarely the arrest of an American.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, Gloria Berbena said, the press spokeswoman of the US interests representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would in any other free society legally - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title ' new Castro as Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, which replaced the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that probably any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries for greater willingness to engage in dialogue move closer together.
Pakistani government officials meet plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope the case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies to identify the Internet after absuchen radicalised young men.
Investigators have said that they have a murky insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had found, because one of them on the Internet video side YouTube made favourably inclined to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, which was briefed on the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah was unable to persuade the al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been kept on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which has become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and still trying to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - still are in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruitment agencies in the identification of future terrorists, and possibly even more important in deciding who is worthy of trust.
The US secret service since the attacks of September 11, 2001, has made it a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
Recruiters do not let the organization as a Pförtner, those whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those who might be spies.
American would-be recruits A Qaeda by a specific test, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US objectives and its propaganda value, but they are also regarded as incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohl Mann, the highest ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups are far more cautious in recent years, also in view, whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to follow anyone in these groups, what better way could go as the recruitment model, which so many have already followed?, Kohl said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding in Copenhagen Climate Action "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded by the negotiators in Bellacruz Congress centre of the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100000 people had added the event, while the police rather estimates of around 25000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked armed activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city zündete.
On a day when the migrated thousands of activists from the United Nations-sponsored climate talks little happened with banners through the city, which was in English, " there is no Planet B " and one in Spanish, which declared that " the earth says' enough '.
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who has said that the trips to Peru, the native land of their mother, her realise what herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to appeal to the large demonstration to participate - to take the floor pass and to the world leaders a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no longer route around it.
The police kept the demonstrators, too close to the Bellacruz-center approach and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked mitführten or pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are banned during demonstrations.
According to a viewer, not to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, anonymous demonstrators burned several explosive devices in black clothes in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main canal, near several ministries.
They threw it in the vicinity of the buildings, he said and added that it began as a Leuchtraketen, but then followed by "a couple of big explosions".
On the inside of the Congress Centre people gathered from television screens to watch the whole afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su As China's Chefklimaunterhändler, apparently not.
When he was asked if he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "this is something that I was not even aware."
He then drove in Mandarin and said: "because the venue is great, I can't hear what is happening out there."
He stated that it is on record as saying from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Audit data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the evidence shows that the fourth- and Achtklässler over the past two years, faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have done.
But in the latest figures from the National evaluation of the educational progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is included, is the stubborn performance gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white Viertklässler rose from Washington D.C. in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which has increased its African-American peers but only three points from 209 at 212.
The performance gap rose in reality between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he fell a statistically negligible point 245 at 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the spot volume was not big enough.
The picture on a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 points scales (262 to 202).
And although the item number of the children of both groups have grown in that time span, the difference has now reduced 58 points.
Some education advocates of the southern last week expressed their concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated, for the most part of white pupils who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D.C..
I will not be said for a span of two or three points, and down the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city urgently need attention.
Of course, you would always see the positive signs, I respect that.
What I am frightened, however, is that we do not invest the time and energy, which we would have to stand up for our resources at school.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
This autumn will lie, for example, some teachers trained a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-reading system to use for pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading, not at the beginning of their school careers have mastered and significantly behind its peer classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth-class games and real life experience brings to the fore, it was reported under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP-progress last week, which were attributed to it.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils benefit below the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue the overall performance of the system and improve the additional money and resources for the weak performance schools can provide, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, examined the urban audit findings.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political fallout working against this important item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, in Washington, currently 180 days, in order to compete with charter schools.
We must increase the school year at approximately 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came with his teachers' union last year to reach agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a major increase in the next Treaty.

Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, which was Gettysburg explore where teaching per year 38690 costs USD, rather a respectful full visitor, than the one enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! Here I will soon be!" Cried Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they are now entering the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" She said food for thought, as their low professor-to-student ratio was reported to the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th, the children in their three-day Tour visited and now they have fully the intended message: the question is not whether to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants do not end the High School or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, the college education is needed to aufzu in the middle class.
In truth, includes one in five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans, the college – which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States, without the completed High School.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labour forces in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study the powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and a powered embedded in them to success.
Many of them have parents who give their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to get in college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills, to help the Wegsuche through the system, then a single measure will at some point also would not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, the Hispanic American students studied.
We must consider a supporting network for these children from pre-school age up through the High School.
The federal program that Gracielas had financed college tour, is a useful example.
It is known as narrow GEAR UP - high gear change up - and represents more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to start college-preparatory programs, which are to begin, if low-income students in the central school and continue until they have completed the High School.
According to the US Department of Education has helped the programme since 1999, more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies from
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government in two auctions concluded on Saturday, major oil companies can get his damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies signed the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades has been hamstrung by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has a commandment, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for June-auctioned fields.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American Ölmultis surprise in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry analysts.
Iraq has finally, after six years of war opened its doors and instead of US companies give Asian and European path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further bids in Iraq.
Security concerns by massive coordinated bombings were underlined on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military's American oil companies have probably prevented, analysts said, to commit itself more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies have been penalised in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies have lower labor costs and more risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies have been able to conclude the agreements with the Treasury.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips were with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the Treaties attributed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, the spokesman said the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on track to be one of the giants of world economy and a technology.
We are convinced that the Chinese companies can be measured with its Mitbietern and fulfil its obligations toward Iraq.
For the requirement levy ahead gave elected company bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each Felds over the current level.
Top planner Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is supposed to be this week, a top-use planner of Al Qaeda have been killed, told representatives of the US counter-terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities representatives of the region by a number of missiles have been killed, which met on Tuesday their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp, which is used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, was taken as the car, authorities said a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Locals are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the spot and quickly took over everything, what remained of the "completely destroyed missiles".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism an unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planners of Al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior officials who wanted to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the US air attacks on Pakistani Schem, citing soil.
If his central role as given, this included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the Topführern of Al-Qaeda and suspended them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American authorities representative said that Somali quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and best compounds used to other extremist groups in the region.
He may be known to some Americans, said the second civic leaders, but this reduces the threat he was for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be Somali the second senior al Qaeda or Taliban leaders, who have been killed since September, was killed in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other Topaktivisten.
The pace of attacks by unmanned air vehicles, the CIA has fallen since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of a nonprofit-operated website, by an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and, at the same time, the suspected informers brutally kill reported side.
Senior UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he is from his post in March will resign, ending a stormy tenure would by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election, supported by the United Nations has been tarnished.
Oath redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concern that the US timetable for military withdrawal will begin in 18 months, other NATO could prompt governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political changeover of Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must meet an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he will not resign his office, but only one of his family in March 2008 complies with the agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now pass, so he had time to look for a replacement.
What I have said is that he is beginning to find a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Mr Ban has begun under UN representatives with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish-Italy-descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the previous UN peacekeeping operations has taken into consideration.
Oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy representative, Peter W. Galbraith, he was indicted in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, was fired, "the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because it is already a great deal of scepticism towards the international interference in the election."
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures, the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He entered the UN leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is used correctly.
Eide expressed his disappointment on the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that I could since May, he said, only one person.
That is disastrous and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he was not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of around 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things I have received on the soul, is, if we have learned over the last six years, something from Iraq, the war of its own Unvorhersagbar."
The Obama administration prefers a sanctions package in recital, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions also relate to the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because "their people tremendously" suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, has joined in an opinion by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences if it complies with its nuclear program to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear-monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran has said that he would forgo the talks to curb its nuclear programme resume, and on an essential part of their camp stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran appears to have but since that time, the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Iran, the international community in relation to a number of proposals which it at the beginning of October had already agreed, has simply left has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that brought together, as they did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran were never, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31 Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue to follow.
In an opinion issued in New York, has condemned the Iranian representation at the United Nations, which it on Thursday "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of certain members of the Security Council called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are prepared to continue, "the talks with the United States and five other world powers in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, the last Friday should return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq meeting with the soldier in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular with regard to limits, property rights and the division of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays of US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August of 115000 at 50000.
Gates also sought to allay the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US Representative quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: " we will get your security, your wealth and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang grew Weijia and her husband surrounded by propaganda posters on which they felt lectures that "mother earth is too tired to talk further children" and "a baby means more a grave."
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, the ermunterten through the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples, more than to have a child, her response was immediate and definitively: "under no circumstances".
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled individual children, who affectionately called "little emperors", has produced a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department of population issues, while the number of the section of the population 60 years and older by 2020 from 16.7 per cent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent to rocket. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in the wealthy coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, have identified 60-year-old children and the elderly almost 22 percent of reported residents Shang shark, while the birth rate below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning practice has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to alleviate "to help the relationship of the ageing of the population and reduce the labor shortages in the future."
Shanghai will soon "as old - but not as rich as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, will be China's one-child policy arguably the most controversial disposal, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who violate this policy must reckon with huge fines - up on her triple annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed this policy, the critical demands on natural country resources could be avoided, while human rights activists condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural regions have some officials pregnant women, who already had a child, forced abzutreiben.
Many couples had also gender-selective abortions, creating a unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years have weakened government representatives for population gradually her position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule - including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are individual children - and 2007 was moderated the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research of Beijing University said that government officials recently even discussed on more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children, which is a partner of individual child.
Shanghai was launched in July, the first Chinese city, an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, belehrten family, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives which describe in detail, who will qualify for a second child and how we can apply for the permit.
The city government has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, aufzu couples at home and seek information sheets under the doors.
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available to have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples is to anticipate the report after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts no change.
In the Huinan municipality with a population of 115000 as an example, still per month, only four to five applications.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign is still around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations probably were the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and this is also legally allowed.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance to the government.
Without a social network, you say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West to assess the one-child policy as the human rights issue, Yang said, a politician, whose wife seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have a child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she would just like a child because she was also a solitary child. " We were used to being the centre of the family and that everyone has shown us.
We are not used to want to care for others and not really. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old, which includes a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of today 20- to 39-year-old grew to see their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question - "we must rebuild his home" - and life planning - "if the child is 9 months old, we must have a CV for the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this time, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to get too many victims.
UN group devises plan for reducing emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the United Nations - until now was emphasized by wild postures and recrimination - has set on Friday with the publication of a document again a focus for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with the industrial nations in the near future should shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which might provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has suffered from both the remaining obstacles, as well as showing the way forward.
But he was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation, the time of next week, more than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a specially created for the UN working group is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries should give to the poor countries in the short and long term, be able to overcome the global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industry and major emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit should be the global temperature increase would support the policy makers.
The process is a great flexibility, John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drafted the six-page document, a 180-page negotiating text in order to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows plans for a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the limit values of 1990, would cut, while major developing countries were to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15-30 percent.
Together the countries could the emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has the talks on Friday also emboldened by their pledge to provide over the next three years, 3.6 billion US dollars per year to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the maestros of floods and droughts by avoiding deforestation.
The Friday nonetheless expressed the same verbal pyrotechnics, which determines the talks in the past week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration drives a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without ensuring that major emerging countries stand up and take action, Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough, that the reductions also confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion an hour after the statement by the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, which meant that the top US climate negotiator either "of lacking common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States not financially China would help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries opened up fault lines.
The current fight also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States to fight amongst themselves because of their relevant commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers to fight, who bear the costs of slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy for their deeds to account.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries which would fight the effects of climate change are most exposed to, said that they remain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though the leading participants say that the talks in the best-case scenario will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members has tabled an early Friday morning, a 24-page draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, "exerting political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues must be resolved before the arrival of the government leaders to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and belonging through the corridors of the Bellacruz centres meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13000 people every day in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows in which they are laughing at the countries, which they believe betrayed and sell and contract drafts are passed from hand to hand rather than by e-mail - already represents a challenge.
The intensity builds just: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for global policy organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train redefined the Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5.00 a.m. 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness, to announce a Zugab journey, which represents a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will achieve in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin-commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally faster to an international rail network, will ankoppeln reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland, connecting in London.
The neglected province could be vibrant commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
Believe in the theory of the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds needed for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could draw on the British high-speed tracks still the brakes.
High speed (HS2) Two, a company based in January, the government of a feasibility study should present, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
Thus, he receives a detailed routes card the next scheduled phase of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, the London will combine with the West Midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site is the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, northwards to produce leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, which would result in a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would or share in the vicinity of Birmingham and a Abzweig would lead to the west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of the North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a railway-insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham stretch in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The draft would be offering the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, increasing the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first route was designed 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1100 people can drive.
Up to 18 trains per hour at the London-Birmingham stretch in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed on the 20000 passengers could be processed per hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to include the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains would have to change first of the high-speed lines on existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, thus making the journey time between London and Scotland would continue over three hours.
This is regarded as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers for mortgages for 75000 pound Orangerie of conservatives on
Alan Duncan, the senior House of Commons, a member of the Conservatives, has asked the taxpayer per year thousands of pounds for the cost of a Orangerie into account in his building residential house in his constituency.
The prison spokesman for the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron, because he complained that the House of Commons members' meager rations " must live their mortgages has increased by 75000 pounds to an oak-Fachwerkanbau to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the taxpayer the extra interest on a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time, and they were also by Sir Thomas Legg cannot be called into question, with a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night, said Duncan that Amendments Nos "not even cleaner or more comprehensible."
Duncan, one of the richest members of House of Commons, has a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
In the nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and Esszimmer, but the Fees Office, a spending control centre of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he has cultivated a winter garden, which is described in the plans as "Orangerie."
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges not to increase borrowing to take a position.
The committee has discussed it last month after an investigation into his expenses by the collapse of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan has transferred security for a mortgage on 271406 pounds (300000 euros) from his London house on his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan until March last year around 1400 pounds (euro 1500) a month as mortgage interest refund.
In April, rose its claims to more than 1800 pounds (euro 2000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-mortgage has not changed during this time, which suggests that the entire increase to finance the money reception of 75000 pounds (85000 euros).
The normal stages RBS loose mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where he is still standing.
The latest published by the House of Commons documents show that Duncan, in this May continues to be entitled to 1250 pounds (1400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost in September, his position as leader of the opposition of the House of Commons, after an Under Cover-reporter filmed him when he said that after the expenses scandal that MPs' meager rations " would live.
"In essence, it means that if we focus on the state, that we must live on meager rations and how Se."
He said: " I have spent my money for my garden and am entitled to a tiny part, compared to the one.
And I would be able to claim the whole damn sum, but I am not doing it. "
The Member of Parliament, millionaire from his former career as a Ölgroßhändler, for the first time was attacked in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he was thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the Fees Office that this "could be considered excessive demand."
An activist has dug in protest in Duncans lawn a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it became known that he had over three years, 4000 pounds (4500 euros).
When he last night was consulted on the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "this has been approved both by the Fees Office, and subsequently by Legg to value increase."
He added: " there is no debate about branching out and weave or a Verbiegen the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be any cleaner and clearer. "

The UDF party alliance (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party, not to use her mark
The party alliance by François Bayrou's party MoDem is monitored, has called on Friday for a takeover attempt by the label, once by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing based party, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted strongly and under threat of prosecution of this stamp on any document to use more.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF Siegel, because he was of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy, after winning the left hand.
The defence minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had received the support of the Members Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), a claim the ownership of the trademark UDF, because he was the first mark in the 2004 National Institute de la propriété industrial " has requested.
However, the business unit broke by François Bayrou's friends party alliance UDF oversaw the silence and clearly gave us to understand that they did not expropriate and set the Minister and the MPs under threat of judicial persecution of a deadline, not to use this label and to transfer the property rights of the trademark.
You have made many statements over the last few days that you are taking your political movement would propose the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the party alliance in one of 19 of the 24 members office letter signed, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis's centrist alliance.
They probably thought that you had the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogans + today's UDF + on their political material, and at the start of your website abdrucken.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls on the NC party to remove "immediately the mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material and (their) website."
Also asked Mr Hervé de Charette ", the property rights of the trademark to qualify their legal entitlement to transfer."
If you refuse, we will lodge a complaint against you in order to defend the law to ensure respect for and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" since 1978, is a fully-fledged political movement and remind you that Morin and his friends "have taken election" this 2007 to leave to start a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, in order to establish the party "UMP."
According to the party Nouveau centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights to use the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to remind you that the last Congress the UDF 2007 the three-year membership of the party MoDem as well as the establishment of a secretariat for the defence "of the material and moral interests" by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing formed movement has passed.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name, for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner by the absence of deposit of Akronyms UDF to carry this out for themselves.
Still give you to bear in mind that this recklessness is poised to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "it seems to us, but in politics as in life would be better to make a name, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by fraudulently acquired a name on it has no legal claims."
Affair Liliane beds Court: François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier, to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane beds Court claims a weak moment of Achtzig years has exploited in order to secure a portion of their assets.

This decision means that there will be a process in this affair, the saga of one of the richest families of France is worthy of mother and daughter are squabbling and at the same time, the reins of the cosmetics empire L 'Oréal in the hand.
Equally, however, the 15th Criminal court ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane beds Court, which will be performed jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L 'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation, presented by the Nanterre Prosecutor of conditions.
On Friday appointed doctors before 10 March 2010 to present a report in which you clearly announce whether and at what times Liliane beds Court could have found in a state of weakness.
I think they will undergo these investigations.
I am going to speak with her, the lawyer stated by Mrs Court beds, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
The lawyer by Françoise beds Court-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very happy with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he reiterated.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds Court a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him of the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited in order to secure grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For its part, has manipulated Liliane beds Court always refuted by the photographers, which she sees as a longtime friend.

Françoise I have never since their marriage can talk more. "
The prosecution of Nanterre is of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react, especially because a judge Vormundschafts in recent days has rejected its application to launch a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane beds Court " is fully capable of law, not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, " reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme beds Court-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Frühaufklärung?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies has our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For more than a decade to impose the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of companies vis-à-vis the consumer from the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determines the best, as it used to be on the consumer-products from the technicians in the station.
By clients at the heart of the company has given the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place to impose... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers back regularly!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, which particularly affects the employees.
These demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & Eund, what is even more crucial to those economic intelligence.
Indeed, it urges the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; hijacked by the staff of a deployment, which completely contradict the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we demand an occupational revolution, which would be to ask the staff in denMittelpunkt the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers.
The very-related benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has submitted his wage workers, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear not, unfortunately.
- First of all, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation, finally, after many roundabout way here, primarily to do... what it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the growing importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders of a highly simplified notion of human behaviour.
Emerged from the large engineering schools is their mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which was recently by the American "neuroscience sciences" relaunches and unknowingly far-reaching of research institutes and the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible to work the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, reinforced a aktuellein Le appeared Figaro.fr poll by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a necessary occupational revolution for the proper functioning of the modern businesses the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental record: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently only the studies from the multi-functional analysis of this idea of the motivation of staff.
These studies have shown that they allowed their companies on the basis of a specified Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this mobilisation factors can predict the executives of the companies' social performance " control and to anticipate and human resource management back to the right place.
They create a fertile soil is favourable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech by Oslo: the "just war" Obama praise from the right a
The American right has defended on Friday by Barack Obama on the eve in Oslo speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, this time were applauding the speech by the President, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that it was even the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoir.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush has inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was in Oslo on Thursday sought to justify the use of force; a way to explain Entscheidungvon nine days ago, 30000 additional troops to send to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, the view of the Präsdent in Oslo "done a very good job."
I found that the speech was really very good, lockte pleased the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's acknowledged.
Habeich in some parts of this speech totally perceived as historic, Ginrich said in the radio programme The take away '.
The Member of Parliament by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased with a "president of the left" to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and not passing on a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech."
In addition, that it is "Kosmopolit" how "he always does," he has' spoken as an American president, "as he pointed out that the Europeans' as live in a security bubble, which they did not create and for their protection, they do not do much," Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights, described the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos."
To the left of the President of the democratic representatives shows Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
He wrapped the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents simply justify warns.
The press remains the moderate left, however, continue to praise on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the premature Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker as he is known for his talent, "launching a large-scale operation".
The speech in Oslo "provides an expiry plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," so enthusiastically California's daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary."
Long-distance drivers: three marathon for an agreement that will secure the supply at Christmas
After three weeks of negotiating marathon came the unions of road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation, which remained until the end - on Friday evening to an agreement, the strike order and the threat of severe supply bottleneck at Christmas to an end.
The signature meeting on Friday evening "welcomed" the competent secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
To crumble after a second night of the negotiations, the Verhandelnden early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement at the end of the morning quickly.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, there has never been more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11: 00.00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement, and only at 6: 00.00 p.m., the agreement was signed.
The conflict, "the company would have very much damaged" and "it was feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hour rate for workers with the lowest wages rise from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"It is not very much, but we are starting once small", as Mr Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block supply centers.
"But it will probably always be a number of Widerspenstige who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF-chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a " good agreement ", although it was difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition. "
According to him, is the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said in this respect, "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the increase in the cost of travel by 3% and upholding the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, in particular, it will allow to tackle the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the burden on the employer to the tune of EUR 100 million," the subject of an amendment to the government for the corrected finance bill was for 2009, which was adopted during the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the first agreement for the companies affiliated to the organisation, and then in the event of an extension through the labour minister for the entire profession.
This will be assured "in a very short period of time" to be the case, Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only postpone the procedure.
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade", because the EUR 100 million "were the sector to offset a portion of carbon tax has already been promised."
The secretary of state for transport forced us to avoid disgruntling as soon as possible to negotiate, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose-eater in the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra.
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a great digging."
Line RER A: disruption this weekend, trade unions, with the proposals of the RATP dissatisfied
The disruption on the RER line A, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris region and the île de France, set themselves at the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, 2 strike between the unions and the leadership of the Independent Paris RATP (passenger transport administration), the strikers with their demands for wage increments to keep waiting.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas drove between 10: 00 and 20: 00.00 p.m. no trains. On the central route (between La Défense and nation) was just one of two trains and outside the central route is only one of four trains.
The end of the SNCF trains was suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which has forced the passengers on the flights.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, the 200000 customers every day counts, welcomed the fact that "the RATP trying to integrate the big business traffic technically."
The RER A runs through the Paris metropolitan area of west to the east.
The section combines the RATP which places Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre and Boissy Saint-Léger issued and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, topsy-turvy around one of two trains on the main transport time schedule, and almost none during the poor transport time.
As has already been on Thursday there was no human Gewühl rising on the railway, as the residents of the île de France had stopped on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less überlaufen than usual, especially because of the lack of high school.
In Boissy Saint-Léger issued (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina said engineer (29), he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier rebelled on time to get to work."
The SNCF, the care of the passengers had planned by officials and security forces, has pointed out that in the Saint-Lazare train station was no bottlenecks.
The SNCF on the RER line A or towards Cergy-Le-skin-powered trains came and went on the Saint-Lazare train station, in order to guarantee the end of the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday again general meetings of the strikers, while the results were reviewed, the associations after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon classified as "pathetic".
The RER-business leaders proposed the specific preparation of a protocol on the RER line A on all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they are calling for a long overdue wage premium.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself continues its Lohnzuschlagsvorschläge in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is in no position to solve a problem, whereas the lorry drivers and the SNCF was also possible."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting to "comprehensive examination of the conditions of work" was planned for Monday.
This shows the associations, too, that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning, looked around 150 drivers the establishment of a committee on in Paris.
It was once again the leadership, which refused to date any discussion during the strike, and a meeting after a calm close to the situation.
On Tuesday threatened the conflict, after a pre-announcement of Unsa and Indépendants on the RER line B auzuweiten.
The associations are calling for a pay award of 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, 30 of whom are variable-euro (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). They also complain that the deterioration in working conditions on this route, on the day millions of travellers.
The driver of the RER line over long years of professional experience, take a gross salary of 2200-2700 euros and a wage premium of 600-650 euros for class services and Sundays and holidays.

The insured party to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation and calls upon the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court transmits the government intervened, anxious to accommodate the Kurdish community and a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to propose the support of the PKK is stifled by the Kurds and to allow the conflict to an end.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a dissolution of a outbreak of tensions in the southeast Anatolia could lead, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in recent weeks led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the Court gathered thousands of demonstrators outside the premises of the DTP in the millions of city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.

After the verdict Türk assumed that the decision of the court, "the despair will continue to strengthen."
"Turkey can clarify these (Kurdish, Mr editorial) issue not on the basis of the ban of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamist movement, regretted the decision.
" We oppose on principle against the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems, " energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island.
"You can apparently reached for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday the PKK and issued an attack in which three days earlier, seven soldiers in northern Turkey died. It was one of the most brutal attacks of recent months.
New Silicon Valley
It was for many years as a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the community with its 216000 inhabitants, 37 miles away from the Moscow Centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Major research and production facilities for micro- and nano electronics here.
Since September 2008 representatives had Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science site linked Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and now signed on Wednesday Selenograd and Frankfurt Riedberg in a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed up for Frankfurt Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts travel for a seminar after Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
We are talking about a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will allow in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to acquire Russian science firms orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for electron technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for the defence research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research establishments are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply, "the new heart of Europe".
Law. S21 is much more than the Tiefer of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which is the City of Baden-Württemberg provincial capital for a decade in shambles construction sites chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks in the middle of the city ends at that time were considered technical transport fossils of the 19th century, as brakeblocks worked a modern rail transport, as it once did an enormous amount of time, locomotives from behind forward umzu margins.
, briefly, to travel further - " s.
And that is why the head should disappear train stations: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And, in Stuttgart: a trans-European rail-masterpiece transit station, about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - so the slogan "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s, no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city almost unaffordable to implement the Tiefer.
Head railway stations, however, have no import and Ausfahrts problem any more, since there are modern turning trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21, beyond the ICE-building route after Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local politicians have pushed through.
The train makes, partly because the risks of the largest infrastructure-retail project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporation.
Baulich cities the project is still reasonably justified.
New city area, which - if we are to believe the generierten computer graphics of the planner - will be equipped with a lot of green.
For the transport system rail is harmful S21.
The transit station and the routes expansion are intended for passenger transport, which - typical 1980s - imposed huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from budget airlines.
Modern transport policy, but it must first be to strengthen the transport of goods, since the transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is not due to intense climbs for freight trains.
This is much worse that S21 indirectly affected many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros will be Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and Engstellen are missing from the network.
Overall, 60 major projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the extension of the well-180-kilometer route across the Rheintal.
Since 1987, will be built on the route in the Zeitlupentempo.
Is an urgent need to drive right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintal route is the real bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict Airport
The provincial government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag, whether they will go against the ruling of the hessischen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition have asked experts in order to allow the more than 400 pages VGH judgment legally examine, said Economics Minister Mr Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had founded on these days in writing, that the country in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5.00 p.m., as provided for by the national government, was not legally required to reconcile protection of the population against noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, whether it is against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized the suspension and capturing the representatives of the government to forego a revision to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD party chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel CDU and FDP urged to return to their prior to the election promises that were made on a night ban. Otherwise, it was a "breach".
It is hellishly difficult if you must keep its word, said Green chief Tareq al-Wazir in an allusion to the FDP election slogan " we hold word '.
Minister Posch indicated the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel back to the country's government is trying with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" after their night flights.
Need a precise legal examination of their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "rapid first impression."
We need a secure legal Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as they are the opposition, the statements of his group never ban on night flights.

The crisis-ridden US behemoths touch their state shackles.
The Bank of America has paid on Wednesday, the aid from the Bankenrettungsfonds Tarp amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (well 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.

Koch's adversary on the board, the Rhineland-pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said in the past week, the countries should change the ZDF-State Treaty so that staff at the proposals Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF finished but also from Beck.
Voraussichtlicher Brenders successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - by the body immediately after the Brender-dismissal criticised for that.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence could nominate him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist and the board of directors, without choosing to get over the suspicion, a supporters into office.
In the party arithmetic Frey is already categorised in the left-wing liberals.
Studies will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: after a year of educational strike drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday, at last, at a meeting of Culture Ministers and university rectors conference agreed by both sides, the studies to improve conditions in Bachelor and master.
The students should in future be able to cope with their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the testing burden: basically every studies module will only end with a single scrutiny.
Moreover, should be guaranteed the workload of students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level."
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audit services between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to a common structure for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries regulations should not be beyond.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture Minister and graduating from university rectors the common dictum of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Akkreditierungsrat decided to reduce the number of audits partially dramatically: "each module includes usually with only one test," it says in a 30-page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part.
With the "will significantly reduce the audit burden," said the Akkreditierungsrat-chairman Reinhold Grimm, should be an "aberration stopped the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted."
Moreover, should be the "Studierbarkeit" in future, "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules as content are " strictly to examine " whether " unnecessary defined in one of the students in the choice of
Events " would be avoided.
The students had the right to preserve margins, which allow and encourage individual initiative. "
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert " – which means that it will take until 2015, until all the courses were reviewed.
Responsible for this are far federal agencies ten accreditation, which is subject to Akkreditierungsrat established by the countries.
The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October "with vigour" to the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not the testing regime is too strict.
In individual Länder have universities and technical colleges with the country's ministries have already agreed on action.
As said so far the only country in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process, additional funds.
Of the money is to strengthen the universities in particular Tutorenprogramme set and studies advice and audit and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to devote ten million euros.
The beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the university law to parliament.
This will be necessary for the conclusion of a study model only a single audit.
The study design should be more flexible, moreover, will facilitate the recognition of performance to prove to other universities and access to the master.
By the end of next year should be reviewed all courses in the country on their Studierbarkeit.
The government and the opposition had argued on Thursday once again on the studies conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Bureau of Juso-university groups called for the organisation of education policy, in future, "behind closed doors," the minister and university rectors held.
The latest educational strikes should now also the students affected "a say."
Support the future graduates from the President of the university rectors conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "we need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with which the HRK debated on a common reform paper.
The union of education and science (GEW) total of the Bonn agreement does not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim, which allows each graduating with a Bachelor-end access to a secondary Masters Course.
On the other, the countries have to make sure that for the current generation of tomorrow Bachelor students sufficiently Masters squares with the best possible conditions studies are available, GEW board member Andreas cellar.
The countries have to hire more professors.
A freer access to the master of the Culture Minister said, however, is not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany and is nice almost no control... " is the initial line of a poem that includes the words of the Lyrikers Werner Söllner, which has lost this troubling language snatches the arrival experience of dissidents, the freedom won, but at the same time his language area.
The 1951 Romanian-born Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor worked in a children's book publishing house before he moved in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has been with various Literature Prizes, in 1993, he stopped the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For considerable except literary sensation he ensured last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, when it came to "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files."
He was visibly unsettled and relocate to read Söllner a declaration in the German writer before Romania colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as IM for Romania's Securitate secret service.
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language price.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am Söllner concluded, "so someone who has protested against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist Werner Söllner IM is Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize homage to Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule is the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors originating from Romania shaken by a case of the spectators and the Dutch recognizable costume of a political system, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as it can be said for bisherigem knowledge, not just the perpetrators, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners literary scholars Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He had swindled him in all for him at the time sensitive points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners declaration was a complete surprise in the form and, before this audience, unexpectedly, is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret services.
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate-spy, Herta Müller had already written in July in the period after she had their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people concerned, so we must presume will be speculated and in some case may also have known how plain name was behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the country is now very procedure safe sighting of the Stasi-files dealing with the Hinterlassenschaften nor the Securitate monitoring very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been obstructed.
An appropriate the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate-files (CNSAS) was founded in 1999, the publication of the files since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, documented following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller said an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar dismissive about the prize winner.
They have interrogated a psychosis, finally did it only once.
The infamy of power meant here quite openly express in the shape of the freedom of expression.
Certainly make the case Söllner, as is so often the case in relation to sneak guilt, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The measured response of the Zuhörenden will be Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge drive than blame and shame.
To Genese of Herta Müller, who yesterday, the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if just a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB-coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a about caused rose C-class ¨.
The man with the striking hell was because of him chauffieren outside town.
Otherwise, he would also have been able to drive himself - alcohol, finally, was not in the game, and besoffen above the 55-year-old girl was no more.
It was a pleasant evening, but this morning, the work is continuing.
Or will not get moving.
In the words of the first three days earlier Schweizers pledged: " we have reached the eighth finals', namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, " but we must not be blinded by the success: it is a brutally tough fight against the descent. "
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then there is the king in Mainz-class to repeat performance in the league's daily life.
And the perfectly again revealed weaknesses by following the rapid three gates Marica (5th), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Auslosung
The eighth finals of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17 + 23/24 February/rear Games 9/10 + 16/17 March) will ausgelost in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy on the fulminanten commencement of Babbel-successor remained so.
Not only the alleged hope of salvation, the anxious Stuttgart professionals in the short time of self-confidence, dedication and game joy.
I am with the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and they have encouraged to be more daring, souls plumber Gross said that as simple-sounding recipe for success, which Therapeut Babbel but no longer had any impact.
He has a certain magic, Babbel pro-Jens Lehman admitted, "if in football, there is a new impetus to happen sometimes things would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, the avancierte after weeks long injury break, thanks to his dynamism straight to the best players in the square to describe tried the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " fresh air " and the operation of the new superiors: " he is a man who takes and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart was not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt Board
The VfB Stuttgart but needs above all constancy.
As hüteten Gross, players and managers, the victory against a weakened replacement and completely swamped defense to exaggerate the Romanian guests.
They have also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 is the evil awakening, Khedira for consideration.
And sports bureau Horst Heldt reminding us that, while a season goal has been achieved, but it is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt himself on his 40th birthday after the first home victory for three months after celebrating was smiling, was on the events of the weekend, in the form of an immediately before the game began broadcast television interviews of gate-keepers Jens Lehman fresh.
There are decisions to others and not the Jens, Heldt, countered the Lehmanns harsh criticism.
Had accused the board of leadership shown weakness and coach change decisively to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after games had been withdrawn, saying Lehman as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure selfishness," keilte Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will not be friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach team through playing whilst practising and vindictive, strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehman in unison - and also the man agreed with the plastic bag.
World Cup Fight in heavyweight
Hitziges duel in Bern: repeatedly provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy-weight title after the WBC version.
The verdict of the judge point fell unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains box-world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the federation WBC beat during the night of Saturday in Bern the Americans Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).

Of the 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced before the duel of the end of the Klitschko-era, but turned away repeatedly the blows of World master, so that Klitschko could bring his dangerous rights not decisively into the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, met his blows the world champions but only rarely.
After all, he is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, with Klitschko has gone through the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some of the furore.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie", "no right".

This year he defeated then in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba, and in September, Chris Arreola from the USA.
I have in this fight is only a stroke and am very well physically in form, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring.
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye after this November 2.13 meter entthronen Nikolai Walujew.
Haye had earlier in the summer of a planned for September fight against Vitaly Klitschko cancelled.

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green group chief Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent findings on air attack from Kunduz has accused the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two fuel trucks trains in September " knowingly the falsehood, " said Green party chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD-news programme " Tagesschau '.
It is called the landläufig: he lied.
The order to kill, was in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only a destruction of abducted vices, but also two targeted Taliban leaders to kill.
In the German Kunduz-commander Colonel Klein requested US air strikes were under NATO inquiry report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
The Greens, the Social Democrats and Left called on Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.

Dream worlds
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it is happening in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must uninhibitedly indulge the wildest ideas and imagination entities.
However, who watch his dream-like conditions experienced sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, mostly in the modern Western world as crazy or drug-addicted, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that blurs the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dream suddenly changed Wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in many different forms, in the best-case scenario, we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if the trigger and effect may distinguish the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New-Age-prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations but similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - Dopamin, noradrenaline, serotonin and Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Fabulous complex hallucinations and delusions thought very frequently occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force has no more power over him
The context of madness and dream philosophers and medic has since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of the Irres with one dream conditions" for Sigmund Freud's dream was "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, sensory deceit of such a".
It is autumn of 2001, when Henning T. transformed into a comic figure.
His body is multi-dimensional two and quietschbunt.
The force has no more power over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him vicious idea encapsulates with blood Red, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They hunt him with serious inflammatory combat boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain on the entire body.
Noisy, dröhnen malignant votes from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices for him to insult.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, they knotet a noose and pinned it on a hook from the ceiling.
He is rising on a loudspeaker and establishes the noose around the neck.
To intervene.
The noose resolves itself.
That should give you a lesson, the voices shouting in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, ' Don in the clinic and let you cure! "
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi-low, he takes medicines against depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, since he is married to three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trick, images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population contracted at least once a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common illness after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis can distinguish people often have no more between domestic and foreign world, they end up in a übererregten state, which can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia.
It is particularly prevalent hear voices - voices command comment or dialogue.
Also, optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is important to distinguish between what is trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is being inundated with impressions.
As the dream also opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, come from the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the psychosis is centered entity, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The Schizophrene finds itself in the middle of it, everything has its importance to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he will be like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and they cannot actively shape.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is not usually possible, which mirrors images are cruel reality wakey excluded.
Once in a lifetime that witnessed a hallucinations to have
Unlike in the dream, fox says, "but remains the sense and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real framework.
Why, exactly, does our brains somersaults, researchers still puzzle.
Emergency situations in every human being that he loses the relation to reality in the short term, fox says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that those affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturing of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, with a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fox explained.
But there remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, which is, furthermore, first for many years, not even manifes animals.
Also, environmental factors play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the question is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, because they interfere with the transmitter system.
If our brain is overheating
Is the stupidity to get Psychotiker suffer their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs, which says Lübecker psychology professor Erich castes.
Whether mirrors images as pleasant or unpleasant, often is only a matter of the position.
Box collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and mirrors phenomena in the past year he has evaluated its results in the book "the unreal world in our head."
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Border line or depression often diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, caste, from memory content, which normally are withheld.
They arise if brain campuses, in which sensory processing, criticised for being over-or too little hampered; if our brain is overheating or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this state just as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love grief or other mental emergency situations.
In recent studies up to a third of the respondents, at least once in the life of an experienced hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the grammar school.
A normal girl.
Were it not for the images and voices.
It in the recess, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
If he says the classmates look surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. dreams, she knows it.
She is awake, she hears and sees these boys, just as the girl in the bank alongside sounds and looks.
They may even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A nice feeling that is, they may be the boy.
I am crazy? They sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other trick images are not real and disappearing.
At night, are some of the most frightening phenomena
Often the trick images are also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, they can not follow the teaching material sometimes because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new classmates, while he explains for everyone else hear and visible from the bar of mathematical equations.
At night the phenomena are frightening.
If she waits in her dark rooms on sleep, which is far too little and too late, she can often not distinguish whether they awake or even dreams, whether the pictures she sees the Fratzen or the girl with the average bleeding wounds of arms and legs, before its open or closed eyes.
They let me in a calm, cries out the figures.
Parents and friends told them nothing about who they consider to be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
In the past year she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago have stopped the hallucinations.
Since she has taken on the Internet contact with the psychologists caste, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Disease is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers allure withdrawal, he says, in all probability after a while hallucinations, caste.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and even provides for his entertainment.
Sarah K., an individual child, had as a little girl fear of other children, often playing them alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 learned that the man known as Papa, since they can think of is not their leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, which is also real impressions and process sounds, it is affected as Sarah K. hard to distinguish mirrors images and reality. " Every experience, " says caste, " will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also digesting night dream images caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy ones do not differ radically from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to Schizophrenen are mentally (DE) Healthy able to recognise their mirrors images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients so the hallucinations as a special ability to enhance.
Border situation between dreams and hallucinations
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience is, unfortunately, mostly pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt-rapier going hard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the hospital for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale-Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a heavy, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - obsession is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-rapier going hard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form a special form of dream suddenly changed guard awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which holds the Erlebende for real and he also retrospectively cannot distinguish from wakefulness.
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patients experienced in full knowledge of a motor paralysis.
If a man of self- and world loss is threatened by continued, total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality through a separate, imaginary world, which is decoupled from the reality, says Schmidt-rapier going hard.
A kind of frontier state between dreams and hallucinations.
As the management of a situation that is not possible in the real world, a world of change is taking place, the real situation but is quoted in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense Foundation and making in a situation is unbearable, enabling us to people own ability, not submerged in a nothing of consciousness loss.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The unceasing art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-experiences in his book ' heart change " as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body at the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen, a strange times and places in a self-created world, visited: he experienced as a bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles, which produce hallucinogenic drugs from blood.
By the Greeks at the motorcycle abducted in its home country, surf with his hospital bed in the Firnschnee the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely on the imagined life, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travel differ radically for Claussen of any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, I have the memories from mental trips after years and abundantly clear in minor details.
More and more even than really Erlebtes.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, the psychiatrist says Schmidt-rapier going hard.
Ultimately show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal copies of external reality are also in the guards.
Any change of consciousness state, summed the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which can also be rewarding.
The snow fall can come
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term will give Hubert Burda his company into the hands of his two children, he said the SPIEGEL.
The holding company should in future include 100 per cent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda provides long-term business in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have a strong will to companies, said the 69-year-olds the SPIEGEL.
We have the details, as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, is only after that.
The question of whether they are in the situation.
You cannot ado 7500 staff of his children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is from January by the chair of the board to withdraw, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen since 1999, a member of the board in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area of responsibility for the company's assets and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also for direct marketing, outside pressure and finances.
For the first time, it is not a family member at the head of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also would be used "to bridge 10, 15 years," Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 per cent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz cases and Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not safe from the sinking: " this was always families could be drawn into a capital, which have speculated away completely and thought they could rise very large player.
My strategy was never.
He had "never World Dreams," Burda.
I do not see myself as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play the game in the World League with ' Time ', these shops have become too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited äuβerst, a device with which one can only his e-mails read without a chance to see certain annexes or to surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, when it chose the magazine Time on one of the products of the year.
It is on the Straβe to see is unlikely, but the idea in itself, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Peek Smartphones cost very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company's success has seen it has two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, in which we must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, such as his American counterpart, however, has come as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, roaming includes for the whole of Europe.
Those with a Smartphone travelling around the world, already know what it means to forgo all the data in order to read his e-mails, once you cross the border, or if you desperately seeks a café with WIFI (or a liaison possibility with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should be for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already specific contracts and offer prices for foreign visits, but in my experience, you will need a doctorate in physics and a good lens about all the small print to read.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb one's own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it has Wifi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariffs, means that the telephone providers are slowly but surely need to rethink and begin to consider different ways how they use their data network.
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is an Internet appliances and pays only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what I expect one day of FonPeek a buying opportunity with lifelong access to the Internet as the Peek already offering in the US.
And that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect that because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
The arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of this colour and the same colour has re-elected to accompany him during his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has very similar models on both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a bright green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat for the same substance, and they wore something groβförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far that it wanted at the first sight seemed that the First Lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and one in Oslo from gemusterten velvet.
The accessories were different: the first time, green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but gold paint.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were high on this occasion as a hair wreath, with the previous they helped open the hair.
75% of working mothers have given their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9737 women aged between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market because of their restricted motherhood.
The study makes it clear that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those auβerhalb carry out of the House with no other work, only part-time work or have no fixed contract of employment, more mothers and have more children.
By contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
" The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job their first child, on average, only 3.7 years after the draw, a figure to 4.1 years for women with solid employment increased the longer have taken to achieve this and her together, and the first child until much later.
Auβerdem also has the kind of work groβen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the contraceptive willingness, " explains the CSIC-researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of the women in the marriage and the first child.
According to the poll is the age at the time of the marriage and the higher the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in the women the same age.
For example, the women in the group of between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the main education or higher education, on average, each with 25.1, or 32.1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, there are still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss already marry before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it look for women of a medium or high school exactly the other way around and only permanent jobs and then to marry and then get their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth
L 'Oréal Paris recently its well beneideten list of female Ambassador added a new name: Diane Kruger.

Auβer that this book is a köstlicher readers enjoy, it is also a moving invitation to read and always reading.
Here are a few sequences from the book.

On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his brain, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife swords, it could almost have been killed."
On Graham Greene: "our man was from this woman with a passion, the three lasted for ten years, dermaβen drawn into its ranks, in whose meat the emotions because of adultery are united with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on a roundabout way of corruption."
On James Joyce: " Ulysses " was in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit of world literature, one must climb on the north wall, on the wall, which repeatedly try the best mountaineers. "
On William Faulkner: " was a comical Kauz.
He sometimes said of himself that he would be the legacy of a boss of the county and other times, he said that he was the son of a Black and a Krokodils.
Both dreams of a certain GröΒe. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: the writer attended the insane cry from a bridge from those personality was also geschrieen from Munich, so that his response until well into the night of the 20th century on his literary way out hallte. He made in a journey that he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the anflehte worms posterity.

On Virginia Wolf: " in her luggage, they had their depression.

Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother fell last week by our city part of walking in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside her and herliefen our dog, our dog is a Mischling we have obtained from the animal sanctuary and barely weighs six kilos, and then out of the blue she missed him two Fußtritte and wounded him seriously.
Our outrage, one can never be summarised in words, because it is incomprehensible to us where the Spass during a cheap aggression against a small and its own helplessness is supposed to be free of animal, which was of course at the leash.
In addition to the tragic attack, a woman who was comfortable walking, she wanted to see these people as a result of an incident chastise them even feared for their own lives, because if a profound mania that attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps also with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o 'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
We have, of course, in a nahgelegenen police department complaint, however, we have grave doubts about whether it will bring anything at all and any prejudice prevent from the outset, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must proceed in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a its own helplessness free animal fun at an animal which gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good upbringing and the respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has created in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use especially among the younger motorcyclists in life, as we now know that both companies.
This initiative will draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element that head injury or even death can prevent in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin has pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in relation to the road safety, "covers much more than just the declarations and production of products, increasingly safe with every day," and reiterated that it with other actions educational and informative nature to contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan '-to-be or not to be ' runs in a first phase on posters to distribute 500 motorcycle workshops, so as to achieve the best as possible proliferation.
To conclude Michelin stressed that the road safety, "a constant concern," the company is, and it is precisely for the reason, as they are manufacturers of tyres for two-rädige vehicles must always be obliged to see one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of small lorries is rising again in
Almost two years after starting the car market for small trucks finally to see light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9425 vehicles licensed in November in Spain, represent an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all for 22 consecutive months going with decline, gemäβ by the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These are good numbers, however, to date, only with groβer caution genieβen because the comparison used reference data in November 2008, which was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, it is important to remember that, in addition to the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, were sold as a whole 95853 vehicles are included in this figure but all vehicles from which the vans market is: descendants of passenger cars, picnicked-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small trucks/chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, what is the demand of the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the Groβteil the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises operating in almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
It has to be on these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten money of credit institutions, other factors with einschlieβen, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the passenger cars, have helped the financial support when buying a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little.
However, this plan is not only destined for private individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if they are a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 Ausstoss not exceed 160 grams per mileage may want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam had reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to send a special attention to these small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealers association predicted for the year 2010, a similar year as last, for which it is looking for a sales shortfall (for passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now compulsory
As the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is happening now with the Stability Control ESP, must be the aid systems on the brakes in emergencies a duty equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already duty of all newly registered passenger cars and light-light commercial vehicles, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The Maβnahme adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of Fuβgänger, but these can brake systems and also because of its working methods to help prevent many Auffahrunfälle.
The task of the Notbrems assistants is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers system on the basis of the driver carried Bremsstärke on the Bremspedal recognises.
However, this system is not that pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned study, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss no longer to enter the Bremspedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU every year up to 1100 fatal accidents, which would Fuβgänger damage, be prevented if all cars with that kind of Notbrems assistants.
It would even be fewer accidents - it is estimated that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - once the so-called intelligent Notbrems systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system (on radar or a camera) recognises obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, he helps the system, to increase the pressure on the Bremspedal if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent exercises maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva during the first week of April will launch probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturers that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel to a conclusion.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, namely that the affected side of their agreement with each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which first postpone the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, to be presented by the beginning of 2010.
Dement against the assurance from GM that it will take in the next few days, a decision on the sale of Saab.
Since it is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that as soon as possible, a decision is made.
GM is to stand with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, wins the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports cars, which the Russian group Converg backing has ever stronger support.
If it should come with any of these buyers to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to schlieβen Saab by the end of the year, if it has not been sold, will continue to maintain.
At the wheel of a Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest used and very expensive jewel engineers the Boxster S as a base and made it really easier to make it 80 kilos, and he now only 1275 kilogram.
In order to create something they refrained from first on the automatic aufklappbare roof, replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the deletion of the air conditioning again 13; auβerdem gets the fuel tank shrunk from 64 to 54 litres, thus were saved another 7 kilo; through the installation of athletic Bacquet-seats again 12 and with the slight 19-customs Felgen again saved five.
Then we had also achieved through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and the exchange of Türgriffe by Griffe from substance the missing kilos.
Although he was also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride in a vehicle with 6-normal hand wheels carried out mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes, which are really very kurvig.
During his driving behaviour can only give it the grade irreproachable.
The reduction of its weight but has not meant that he would now no longer so sure on the Straβe lie.
It is quite the opposite: since we have long no longer such a small and easy model test dangers, which gives a but also a sense of groβer safety in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, his muscles warm in a low gear in the necessary time to make before we give him the orders to rasen, to slow to recover and then again, everything from his engine to extract...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its control, which is just as communicative as too precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded, and it can increase with the ' sport ' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which is already the Panamera met for the first time.
The streamlining assets is unimaginable brutality, whether from the foot or when re-acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or inconvenient.
The asphalt on the Landstraβen on which we went with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car meisterte well the potholes.
The electronic assistants had on the whole route almost nothing at all to do; and, despite the fact that we found some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that there is an ultra-easy car is a car with an indescribable Fahrspass has, as it otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a slight improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car is on the market in February 2010 and cost 70831 EURO.
Bag girl '
The singer, a friend of Finland by Karl storage area, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a Gelegenheitsstarlett during the Modenschauen ' maison ', they presented their rude face with the same such stubbornness as their pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "bad girl" or "it girl", she is a "Bag girl."
The Baskonia pays itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex Fuβballfeld of Maccabi Electra and comes to the first place in its group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic was with eight triple the best of his team (29 assessment).
The team from Vitoria the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a very broad dose to replace use and team work, even if they wait until the bitter end on their victory muβten.
The great hits from the Peri metres out with 16 valued at three times maβgeblich wore on her final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Red Blue, which from the outset at the top of the ads table.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Peri metres out, you could guess that they had arrived on the pitch with well-baked hand Gelenken.
There were English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava opted for a innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game by Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, which is home to increase their advantage further before the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began as the best of his team with 13 points, to highlight also wennn "minus six" assessment of cluster lieβen imagined that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But it was the game despite the clear advantage into the break far from decided and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer once again remind you that on their pitch not everyone wins, and thanks to the repeated "hand of Elías" came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini wore a crucial role in the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50-49).
Still more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get re-air and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, with nearly three successive triple and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that back on the ads table einberuhigender interval (54-67) was reported by the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) could make.
In the last quarter of the Alavesen were bloβgestellt and English and San Emeterio (60-75) has already announced that they would allow anyone to deprive them of the victory in the first dreiβig minutes honestly deserved.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson best not their team and trying to give their team by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and despite the cluster because Fouls was submitted by the place, not on the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis nor at the last minute aufholten (80-85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja was stood up to
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to relinquish the lead in Group B of the Euro League to him, and that in a game that was marked by the failure on the part of players from Unicajas (free country, Lima and Archibald), particularly in the domestic game, what the Greeks facilitated the victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their dargebotenen game in the first quarter of the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts in the 9th minute with 12-18.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja, even if the local team with a domestic game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads plaque in the 13th minute, 22-20 anzeigte in their favour, the minute in which it almost due to an action for the brawl between the two Americans would Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began at last to be warm and his superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel free country because of injury and the three clear traces the Unicaja hinterlieβen self-inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez.
Among their players in the domestic sphere and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 to 32.
A dash was impossible
The third game quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, despite its 19 losses showed superior and even managed to offset the difference in Malaga armed game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which, in turn, the leadership within the group of motor fuel.
Unicaja tried on many defaults and the departure of the Scots injured during the game, Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31 minute, thanks to the leadership and the triple by Cook and the use of Lewis hopes of 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible not to slow as the Olympiacos as soon as he attacked and his superiority with centimeters within the basket area showed.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed 37 minute basket difference to rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to relinquish the lead anOlympiacos.

Brazil called Zelaya of Honduras has a date to leave
The Brazilian Government has set the residence of Manuel Zelaya of Honduras has in its embassy in Tegucigalpa a deadline.
The President enthobene office must 2010verlassen diplomatic representation at the latest, on 27 January, when his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, trade delegates of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo that "Mel" weiβ that he thought the message before that date, in which he had found since 21 September asylum must have left.
"He is bewuβt, that he must go on 27 January, because his mandate expires on that day and he will have to seek a new shelter."
The station also quoted the ex-president, confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "my position is to go as soon as possible, logically, with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya of Honduras has said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (which Porfirio Lobo won by a) Zelaya of Honduras has assured that he would stay until January at the Brazilian Embassy.
However, he tried this week to obtain refuge in Brazil.
This, however, foundered on the refusal Zelayas, the status of an asylum seeker politician to recognise him wanted to impose on the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, has returned to the markets, the uncertainty of what is surprising in any case, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The Maβnahme used to stabilize the markets, it was to pay off the debt with the direct purchase of assets and, indirectly, the liquidity to allow a free hand in interest rates, which move the zero, so that in this way the banks assets to buy Abrechnen.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, something to throw a spanner in the works, as the näc BCE already masked eighth with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox Maβnahmen and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten of stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para-normal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalise private risks and increase the national debt again.
It is now back on the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the euro-area countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, does not harm a degree of uncertainty in order to produce the defenders of the moral hazard to silence the again tried with the leaders of the world's economic policy, an awareness, for what they had caused, because they are the devastating effects the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they are actually a new day for beschlieβen thanks action should have been.
Nevertheless, this indicates what happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren out to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously anticipated.
A government which conceals the public debt, elections and a new government, which draws on the same side.
Prodi made in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates after Durão Barroso in Portugal.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non-fulfilment of its external payments saves and thus gives a euro member country to meet its commitments.
However, it is logical that Ecofin forced the Greek government has to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with the duty to maintain the stability of public money.
Yes, we are still expecting an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to large sums, that would now lie within the Erwarteten.
In the case of Spain, we must not to worry, as long as the differences of government debt increased at the same speed as the European company bonuses.
However, should reduce the European differences and increase the Spanish, dannn there would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators of a Groβteil of market research institutes forces to correct their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 upwards, the einschlieβlich OCDE and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, promising all this despite warnings not long life.

According to the chairman of Iberdrola must invest Spain by 2020, 50 billion Euround another 60 billion from that date until 2030, under the promotion that the current nuclear power stations remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investments required would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it no longer should invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to damp down the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18000 MW more will be needed under the promotion of course by other "base energy".
Galán, which is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what is called for his company has no desire whatsoever to say something against this law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, what exactly the opposite of all the political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, " we will, in the long term, clearly in this direction, despite some " individual " Maβnahmen, as she indicated the chairman of Iberdrola.
It should be that as it may, Galán believes that it is already the decisions on the investment, even if these are the long term, should make, because it will need some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to take them.

The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, which typically are more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database contains 1034 vehicles, 666 are passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need to use a computer with Internet connection.
After that is to repair model based on the chassis number have been identified, is a graphic overview of the respective model and will then select the needed spare parts.
The user can involve variables, such as the price for the working hours, Aufpreise or rebates and then he can ausdrucken cost estimates and pass on to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for evaluation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference list.
The main difference between the two systems is that to dieWerkstatt geared contains no estimated working hours.
The costs for this tool 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
At present, the company operates Audatex, also offer these images into three-dimensional format.
It is an innovation on the car mechanic long wait, because with her, for example, can select a door and the picture can complete turn around to look at the inner side.
