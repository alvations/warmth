The official estimates were only as likely 3% - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the issuing banks American, British and Canadian, not severed the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, together with rising prices of raw materials and reducing unemployment forced provoke a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the rate of inflation below, but at least nearly two per cent.
According to a analyst, the ECB is the trap 22: "needs to negotiate" inflation for subsequently not have to intervene in this issue.
The 3.3% inflation, recorded in Germany, beating the record of twelve years; in both Espana increased from 3.6 4.1 percent.

Gallup provides a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Democrats Young increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, as Gallup never experienced before such a low level - 13% - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the electorate sure of the parties, due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean a support more than two thirds (71%) vis-à-vis the support of a fifth socialists (20%).
Under the survey, the Forum Democratic and the Alliance of Free Democrats reach not the necessary limit to have any parliamentary escano: its support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among the electorate insurance there is one percent of further sympathisers on both sides.
The economic environment followed deteriorating even in comparison with the lowest previous point - has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who judged particularly bad the economic situation in the country, as another 46% believes that the situation is rather bad.
The families, after the more hopeful expectations of the spring and the summer, are now more pessimistic in terms of the change in their own economic situation.
With regard to the next ano, the majority of the population account with the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71% of consulted, higher figure to any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of government rather bad desempena it their functions.
The 13% of consulted trusts or much confident Ferenc Gyurcsány, as Viktor Orbán counts on the support of the 38 percent of consulted.
A 54% of the population does not trust all in the head of government and 27% no confidence in the president of the Alliance of Youth Democrats.
One of the indicators of the shape of the political situation is what proportion of society believes that it is possible to monitor the discontent experienced against the person of the head of government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last ano 35% felt it would be desirable to maintain power to the government and the head of government, this proportion is currently only 20%, as the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest referendum is characterised by the fact that 60% of respondents to the question on participation responded that engages and another 20% said likely to participate.

The most expensive Auchan Tesco has increased fivefold their prices
Mantuvieron increase in the average price level of 16% of commercial triangle hypermarkets gold Budaörs, with the difference that this ano has not increased VAT.
Article Napi Gazdaság
This ano also increased in an average of 16% in the commercial golden triangle Budaörs Christmas the usual canasta of the daily Napi, but in all the hypermarkets saw a very higher growth HUF thousand.
As in December last ano had already been "soared" prices in supermarkets of food, not experienced a drastic percentage rise in comparison with the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what the past ano could to buy a price well below the nine thousand HUF we can do or ten thousand.
The Napi canasta in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value canasta was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 ano this canasta 6800 trouble HUF).
The price of spirits Unicum and fish remained at the level of the previous ano almost, but saw a sharp increase in turkey pechuga steak, nut and poppy seed.
The price of the wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although Auchan we have found a kilo of bread by the price of 139 HUF.
The competition not cut the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
Equally was astonishing in this shop than the price of Coca-Cola redimible two litre bottles cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, only cost 257 HUF.
However, in the canasta Napi Auchan was the most expensive, as the Cora cheaper.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of last ano Christmas Cora increased with 15 as Tesco and Auchan nearly 18% prices contained in the Napi canasta.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canasta last ano with the canasta cheaper of this ano, the gap has been a 12%, as growth between the cheapest of the past ano and the most expensive of this ano has been a 21%.
The average growth was HUF 1480.
Last ano the average growth in prices was 1206 HUF, so that during the last ano Christmas in prices felt the rise of VAT.
It is precisely this process was shattered trade, supermarkets visibly were incapable of decision on the price room for each product to implement and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(The trader badly programmed the speed of the movement of a product, may lose a major profit margin line with the turnover).
The increase in the price of the canasta Napi reached such extremes consequence of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was superior 1720 HUF value recorded in 2006, while the cheapest difference was only 844 HUF.
This ano not occurred such extremes, since the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than the ano past and cheaper increased HUF 1284.
Comparing navidenas two seasons, a catastrophic growth recorded in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets grew more than 30% the price of consumer articles of first need.
(We necessarily confirms the figures of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some food recorded first need for an increase in the meantime 12 months of higher price to 30%.
For example, apart from wheat, in the case of the egg).
According to the canasta Napi, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product was already quite expensive last ano relative to the basis, recorded in the worst barely 10% of price increases.
According to all indices, suppliers of flour have a stronger position that egg able to impose dramatic rise in prices even the multinationals.
The hypermarkets complain not in the commercial golden triangle, constantly talking about positive results.
According to our experience garnered the majority of consumers of the three visited shops, no longer care about prices.
Of all products buy large quantities, taking paletas retained food.
In the manana Wednesday, in the three shops formed large queues of the boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information inside the country's volumes of selling are lower, many multinationals complain survey institutes because the income left below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the appliances.
In many hospitals saves disinfectants
This ano recorded in hospitals thousands of infections produced in the first place for the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygiene sidelines in hospitals, bed overcrowding and staff overload not encourage control of infections - affirms the médica-jefa department of the National Centre Epidemiología.
In many hospitals saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the Hospital traumatología department János.
In a man hospital after a serious accident identified the presence of the bacterium resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same sort of infection occurred in this hospital early in the ano.
a wounded of a serious car accident gave high hospital and the same patient soon due to return to the contagion consequence hospital with MRSA and since then has not been able to make a major surgical intervention by the presence of the body bacteria.
Until 10 December this ano recorded in the National System Nosocomialis 1094 Surveillance cases of infection hospital produced by multi-resistant agents - said Karolina Böröcz médica-jefa department of the National Centre Epidemiología.
This means that hospital certainly has been this amount of infections produced by multi-resistant agents, the rest has no information.
Around two-thirds of infections (683 cases) should be MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of human beings lead in its nose of Staphylococcus bacterium aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
The infections produced by the SA (interest-led: inflammation of the gorge amigdalitis skin infections, infection wounds) well react to antibiotics and easy treatment.
However, once applied exaggerated or unduly to antibiotics, bacteria usually well react to antibiotics, converting very bacteria resistant to antibiotics and spread quickly in hospital inadequate conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example of infections injured or endotoxic first patients with transitional or chronic immunodeficiency patients with the weakened body, elderly or people of little weight.
In the view of the médico-director Hospital nothing János particularly in the MRSA infection, these are daily infections in hospitals.
infection must not be confused with the epidemic, only MRSA is absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where their presence is not examined.
Resistente antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff meets them in rubber and mask gloves and appropriate antibiotics exist for processing" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
The patients hospitalized are examined previously to verify the presence of the body MRSA, but even can prevent the infection in all cases.
There is fashionable take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, the circumstances nevertheless national hospital not conducive to prevent training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - states Böröcz Karolina.
As this infection fundamentally occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine patients hospitalized and immediately isolating enfermes body lead the MRSA.
However, the Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable sampling micro-biological.
This is also due to the National Health Box are not funding these medical examinations.
So the majority of cases leaving to the public when there are already infections of MRSA visible in the patient - said médica-jefa department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union rigorous encomiendas for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
We must empenarse therapy directed antibiotic, or we should be microbiological examinations to stop resistance to medicines, but not always hospitals meet this demand.
The sampling micro-biological are even less frequent in the case of patients mobile or in the basic assistance - said Böröcz Karolina.
It saves disinfectants
Experiments scientists have shown that in most cases MRSA a patient infects another through health staff.
Therefore, a very important role desempenan the laundering of hand, the use of rubber and masks gloves, but also in this regard are experiencing considerable mistakes in hospitals.
The MRSA is contaminated through the transmission by drops and the direct contact between people, but in hospital national circumstances is not always possible to isolate the patient infected.
Moreover, hospitals rooms often they are overcrowded bed often are very together, but to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately it can experience too - added Karolina Böröcz - that hospital less favourable economic situation saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood for the infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where meet the appropriate measures of prevention, are registered less infections of this kind or can stop the spread of the agent.
government against MRSA Programme
The treatment with MRSA infection is an enormous expenditure for the Fund National of disease Seguro, so in all countries fight against him.
In Britain, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce the cases of MRSA.
Apparently the programme has successes, according to the data supplied, infections with MRSA show trend decline in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between its priorities has the prevention of multi-resistant agents (between these MRSA) and hospital infections they to these pathogens.

Bulgaria, the EU property paradise
It is impressive the development of the Bulgarian property market - the attention of the whole of Europe is heading towards this Balkan country shortly before mentioned.
What thing, where and who buy even more cheaply in the market for the EU, which will rise rapidly?
analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
The objective preferred for property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is certainly Bulgaria, with their cheap apartments in ski slopes and beaches villa.
The regions montanosas Bansko Borovec Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favourite, as beaches Albena "Golden" Costa, the "Sun Costa," the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but increasingly people seeking property in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts Re / Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo Gabrovo Elena Triavna - incite the interest of property developers and ever more people buy property in particular cheap Rus area.
Similarly can be attractive capital Sofia, trade and office spaces promise rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive havens in golf in Europe, thereby a destination also highlighted during the other two stations, as well as the summer and the winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, who buy buildings in Bulgaria, are trying to change their lives and their way to live.
The majority of customers are English, but also come from France, Belgium, Espana and increasingly of Romania.
It also are present Cypriots and Maltese promoters and traditionally there are many Russians clients on the beaches of the Black Sea and ski havens.
The foreign clients may be classified into three groups - Georgi Jankov says, regional director of Re / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who claim to settle buy here new or revised property by a price between 50 and EUR 100 thousand either old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 1000 euros to renew later.
They need good communication and access and for them is important proximity of a large city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
They are the second category of self-catering buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 of the German holiday destinations).
They are the third group investors property to their purchases with hope to benefit medium or long term.
The price of property capitalinos is growing, since demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest property price, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of buildings considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and six Hungarian hundreds
According to the reported Environment Minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor level meetings of experts eventually Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening continue negotiations at ministerial level on the international climate regime post - 2012.
The experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world deliberating about the Roadmap Balí disposal over the subsequent efforts to the period of reducing emissions, established in the Kyoto Protocol force until 2012.
Today are implemented lively discussions about the particular between the developing countries and the industrialized.
The US has already indicated that at the moment does not negotiate accurate figures, although tends to reach the agreement in comparison with the situation in 1990 to 2020 ano decline with 25 to 40% the emission of gases by the greenhouse effect.
Another major issue of the conference is that if the industrialized countries, in addition to reduce emissions, or unwilling to give material and technical assistance to countries that need.
They agreed also on aid to offer the developing countries.
The support fund, provided in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by an integrated board by 16 members, probably within the Global Fund for the Environment UN (GEF) - writes the "Piac Profit is".
The six hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Environment Minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to retain their vanguard role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU undertakes reduced until 2020, with regard to the 1990 level in 20% its gas emissions, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not sign the "agreement after 2012" and is prepared to commit itself to reduce even 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also prepared to accept commitments under their responsibility and their skills.
Gábor finger Fodor signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 undertook to reduce 5.2% within this, then 15 EU Member States undertook to meet 8% reduction.
The commitment of Hungary is to reduce 6% emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect on the period between 1985 and 87, meet our country - the press senala of the Ministry of Environment.
Much at stake Balí, because within two years will have to sign the international agreement of the long-term climate policy, because, if not sure that its entry into force deferring after 2012. in this case reduction commitments undertaken in the Kyoto Protocol would be immediately followed by a new international system of reducing emissions, whose need was perceived in its most recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN deals with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Thus, reducing emissions suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of over 2 or C of the average temperature of the Earth, according to the scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army in recruited YouTube
The units of the British army in a videos distributor recordings published on filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularise themselves.
First the British air force (RAD) was the advantage of the YouTube services: the displaced special units in Afghanistan since the March 2006 videos are burdened on their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras riding helmets control in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
It is inevitable political message
It is 139 the recordings from the soldiers of air force that have been burdened with this way the Internet and his "channel" has already been seen over 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Ministry recorded in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence mistake" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq as in Afghanistan, meanwhile the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) as the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channel YouTube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally air force was loaded with the objectives videos recruitment, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence also serve to make the public the real purpose of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda costs nothing in comparison with conventional TV spots recruitment - declared the BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably have any political message, because a specific form justify the reason for military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a videogame
The army is concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recordings published and abrogated recelosamente, in the distributor also appear amateur videos, for example on the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the official talk as maximum losses but present the bloody part of the fighting.
Moreover, the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet already many videos engravings on real operations, but the British army recently only is exploiting this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way for recruitment with the free descargables so-called gunfire videogames America's Tartan, in the middle of a more or less real situation player can get directly instead of soldiers.

If the National Assembly disapproves of the law of public health, unions immediately withdrawn its appeal to strike.
Instead, if the law is adopted, committees are meeting strike and decide about the future.
Based on the agenda for Monday of the National Assembly is also possible that only vote on the law of public health in the hours of the night very tickets, or better near midnight.
As a result of the strike beginning on Monday, we will have to reckon with significant difficulties in transport: railways will work indefinitely, for the manana can stop part of collective transport in Budapest and more than half of the inter-city transport of EU-imposed buses Volán.
At the same time, in many points of the country will have closure of half of the ways of the roads.

Political Capital: the country increases the risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk-Audit Division Analysing) of the Capital Political the activities of the Hungarian Guard, established in August ano with the support of the Movement for a better Hungary, from several points of view the political risk has increased from Hungary and the region.
In the "warning about risks" companía writes: in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is that "with the worsening of existing ethnic tensions between the Roma population and not Roma Hungary, even in the short term can be ethnic violent clashes".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - added the representative of the research institute.
They alleged that all this is due to a major faults of the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life caved public discussion of the Roma problem representatives of the political groupings radical and extremists, who could base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarian".
This exacerbates the problem, the normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of the violent conflicts - estimate.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activities of the National Guard, consequence of the great attention of national and international average, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in regard to stability and democratic development in the country."
We remember that: from 2006 otono received ever greater publicity and momentum reorganisation of radical groups and extreme right in Hungary and since the summer of 2007 have been many organisations in the country define themselves "associations of national self-defense".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while it openly proclaim the training of its members for defence - even armed - civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), alluding to inadequacies of the police, the army, i.e. state" - add.
They said: all this occurs in accordance with the method to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the society discontent with politics and the political parties.
Because civil stress and form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of the legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbours referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nacionalistas political figures in certain neighbouring countries, want to justify their own political anti-húngara with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region "- added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so throughout the region's political risks were increased.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in such a way for example Búlgara the National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the National Union Búlgara (UNB) of the extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard to the mass unrest of the Roma that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking this situation, the UNB decided constitute guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there were "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Capital Political.
Agregaron: this initiative has provoked a animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As wrote, shows the increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts that certain Bulgaria Roma organizations have announced that to resist, form its own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard until now has shown similarities with the National Guard Búlgara, can not be excluded that the Roma Hungary reacting to the threat Similarly, organising its own self-defence - can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The head of the Political research Capital, Attila Juhász the question of the news agency said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As each ano publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The party is not always writes red
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days write red in the timetable and has already become a widespread practice around holidays - that next ano fewer - reorganise working hours.
Even in the EU or in America the festivities uniform.
The Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, festival of state and ceremonial days.
The ceremonial days mainly relate to religious Christmas and historical anniversaries.
Festejamos New honest: both the last day of the old ano, as the first day of the new ano holiday - the latter mainly to rest passed celebrating the old ano.
Throughout the ano have eleven festivities with red written in the timetable.
It is national holiday on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October memorial day of 1956 revolution.
On 20 August welcome the foundation of the State 1 or May the party of work, 1 and 2 or November remember our dead family and friends.
Moreover, in our country are holidays of two days Easter Resurrección Whit and Christmas.
According to the timetable, our state, religious or national holidays often coincide with a weekend therefore often bridge when before or after the party there is a single working hours.
In exchange for the weekend alargados, during the previous Saturdays can not leave of work or school.
It is the minister of work that their specific regulation when we need to work exactly in exchange for the day directly precedent or after the party.
This legal rule is obligatory for all employers and for their employees, as well as for public officials and employees.
It is not obligatory instead for service companies and institutions that, due to its role, work uninterruptedly even during the ceremonial days.
This ano the order of work can only be altered around the celebrations of the end of ano: from 24 December virtually stop life in the country, because under the experience, the majority of people "makes bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the ano or take their holiday during these days.
The next ano number of our festivities coincide with middle or weekend, so that there will be fewer changes in working hours that this ano.
First will change the agenda on the party of the job, then for four successive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, 26 April will working hours, for change Friday 2 May is festive day.
The other change relates to the party of 23 October: Saturday 18 October, will have to work in place of Friday 24.
Instead, the next ano during the party of end ano can rest because from 24 December does not work anywhere almost, even if the last day of the ano a Wednesday.

The car making slow progress in the usual backlog of the manana.
It sounds a pause on the radio extrano: with electronic violin effects.
Subo volume.
Cambia the pace of music and previous tones builds low and then the voice of a chorus female as a real gem intervenes.
The mr channel 2 song Wings reproduces of Love Zagar.
The musical national life does not malcrió us much pop with electronic quality.
But now appears totally different this standstill when federal listening to the new disc Zagar.
That features Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs underground digital national gradually changing the image and although again fashionable the rock garage style, breaks guitarras pop electro national has shown: there are innovations under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs touched in all Yonderboi until it began its independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of a whole.
With its draft (Zagar) and music, a mixture of jazz, electronic bailable music and pop tried succeed, when asked cinema soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public the whole experienced acted in principle only clubs pequenos when the magazine wan 2 selected its first disc published in 2002 between the fifty greater national records, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the single national appointment of trends, able to sell in western markets.
No doubt Zagar and all are fashionable, but nobody they asked whether or not lead gladly this label.
The whole reacted as must react: a new disc prepared and even better.
The newly launched disc, entitled not Walk Can Fly Instead will open new paths for them, although the title itself seeks to establish the continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the former set of Balázs Zságer.
It is good reference about successful, on the flight, but also successful music, appeared now - according to the spirit and the tendency of the time - the guitarra sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented in the disk Millenáris György Ligeti singer currently works in England The Puzzle whole.
In the disc includes a real success of the channel mr 2 Petõfi that recently transmitted manana popular music night. This station led to the ears of the radioyentes music high flight Wings of Love engraved with six Hungarian singers ($Underground ivas ").
Because everything is in order (?).
hvg. hu asked Zságer Balázs.
hvg hu: Following this new success the question arises: What You are interpreting, how it is a music devoted to a select public?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of the public select means little to me.
I believe there are two types of caste in the slight music; not mainstream and underground no alternative and pop, but trade and sincere.
Also the so-called underground music alternative can be boring, senseless and can be equally composed only for sale, trade.
But also a good song pop can arise from an honest inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg. hu: see any difference between the reception of your music from the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: abroad, especially the west of us, the slight music has more great traditions.
That not only generations of 15 and twenty years frequent concerts, but also older.
They are basing their assumptions much more attention to the changes produced in around the slight music, because the considered part of contemporary culture.
hvg. hu: What role has the public in your job?
Do you matter who, where and how many are the people who listen your music?
B. Zs: I feel naturally well to see that increasingly attending our concerts people.
But we have never composed music to the market.
Not made up by some objective music, but for some reason.
The role of the public feels rather concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only inconceivable changes of the moment.
However, I realised that if you want comply with the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
hvg hu: How much pretendes follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather the west of us.
B. Zs: not We their way, despite sometimes trying to compare our music.
We work rather team relying on the music presence of the other and we allow unfold.
In principle was inevitable to compare our work with the Yonderboi music, because many of us started our career in your group and hence undertake other way.
hvg hu: in the list of success mr 2 Petõfi Wings of Love in the first place.
Many people listened for the first time the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Is Abriste concientemente with this style towards a broader layer?
Zs. B.: not sought to comprise success these successes and sell our disc.
This song is something more than this.
The agregamos at the end of the disc, trying to relax after noise orgy of disc and heavier issues.
hvg hu: How you selected the six singers?
Why rightly - - what was the main reason?
B. Zs: The idea was to create a chorus of the style gospel.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the good attend voice of our own national musical scenario.
This was created this chorus of six women - or Kutzora Edina Seine Jay Judie Péterfy Bori Hodosi Enikõ [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was subsequently christened Divas Underground.
hvg hu: exact Compusiste song or girls changed some things?
Zs. B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we had the whole material disc, we believe that still something.
The commensurate attracted the edge.
Even that night recorded the song later learned girls.
Everything virtually came to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I enthusiastically commensurately then, but naturally also needed the Divas.
With my voice had not worked so force.
hvg hu: Both in the concert as disc seems as if the girls were second place.
No attend (except the short Judy Jay only), have no role itself sing all together and not more strongly that music, so music acompana not only their songs.
Also in the scene rank in substance.
Whether wilfully?
B. Zs: There are basically simply for technical problems.
Instead deliberately not wanted to distribute attend roles.
The tune also about this forget our ego a while, who where has been and where it will therefore let those wings, the wings of love lift us.
It wanted to ensure that other felt those euphoric state of mind that we feel when this song was born.
hvg. hu: what dedicaste more work?
Zs. B.: music composition in reality to any, rather in mixing pieces there were more difficult.
For example Dorian's Gray Dilemma I am coming in a concert piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where a long while wanted not function the groove and then gradually all was their place as a puzzle.
hvg. hu: What is your preferred song in the new disc?
Zs. B.: This ever-changing concerts and because I have already "unleashed" disc.
Now Prophet Is Fool Escape From The Earth and The Never Same.
A deceptive corridor of stock risk billions of inferiority complex
A malversador unfair.
This is as states to its old employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant of French Lyonnaise banker Générale master of the Bank of Trade Czech.
For him lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than Kerviel was a great player who sought compared to his colleagues, and certainly with good capacities.
Intuyó long ago, unlike all Czech big banks, the crisis in the American market mortgages.
"You have a fragile nature" was left hear his superiors, the same who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from the responses of Kerviel according to what show little sign of the French media such as Le Monde, it was a man at the end of last year had a gain of over 1.6 billion thanks to their business.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything we wanted to was earn money for my bank" guaranteed in their responses.
Precisely in the summer, managed win during the American crisis, 500 million.
This opportunity already seen to come from year principles.
In February began to listen to some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to customers of low income or those in the past had problems with payments and that these customers start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence throughout the economy.
Kerviel not thought and opted correctly.
Furthermore, at the end of the year their earnings outstripped 1.6 billion.
"When already gané my first 500 million knew not as notify" confesses Kerviel and adds, that nothing has left at all.
Throughout the interrogation declared that it had distorted records so that we do not come to his discovery.
Even came to deceive bosses, even if the stock exchange Eurex began to interest by their business.
The risk became benefit
What I was afraid to be found?
Rather, not.
"I thought it had won £1.6 billion for the bank and from this fact, that they pleased".
Where came such strength of will to risk in this way?
In my position gradually should work.
It became to work Lyonnaise Générale in the year 2000, exactly after studying in Lyons end.
Its annual salary handled between 51 dollars.
Two years after it was assistant of Exchange corridor and in 2005 became corridor bag with an annual salary of 90 dollars.
Yet never knew she would gain as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005 observed because I looked with caution.
Because of my training and also my personal and professional advancement "described Kerviel researchers.
But the little time my entry into the company arrived the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million.
This was a mechanism of grubbing-up, and more wanted.
If appetite, you we leave
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it says that the heads of knew everything or rather suspected.
"While earned money, the eyes shut".
Only, after the coup reached early this year.
In a day lost billion euros.
After the weekend half of January wanted erase all mark.
When Monday came to work, no longer working in the bank.
two dias, after the bank announced that he had lost 5 billion euros for their fault.
And how managed locate him?
became suspect from their holiday.
"Elegí only four dias last year.
The corridor, which has no holiday is a corridor not to nobody takes a look at his dossier "ended Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has a chance of getting billion 365
The ministers from the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes for which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately Crowns 365 billion).
It is practicamente half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
seven operational programmes will be approximately 125 billion Crowns for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain 100 billion Crowns Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The majority of the money will go designed to transport, to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the greatest operational programmes and represents 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.800 millions of kroner.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme must serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in innovation of business.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recien who are taken paises used less.
Death twenty years for the ex-chair of Nicaragua, the court declared
The Court Apelaciones Nicaragua Thursday declared the death 20 years for the ex-chair country, German Arnoldo, which was convicted in 2003 by the $100 billion place to misappropriate (almost 1.8 billion Crowns).
Nevertheless, a time, following was released from prison to move to house arrest in its treasury not far from the Nicaraguan metrópili.
Nothing is clear now under the PA agency, the then Chief Central American between 1197 and 2002, back behind bars.
Under the chairman of the Court Apelaciones Ileana Pérez, rather depend on the prison agents if leave German end at home punishment or so return to the prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated as German traspasaba constantly money from the government to the account of a company Pánama.
This was fictitious society and the account, in fact, belonged to their families and further supporters cercanosT.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
He has adopted the budget
So.
The budget state was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first produced by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget this year was already adopted with the support of the SSD, because it paved the Sobotka minister and SSD could not afford not accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, this traditional view although the most influential, calmly approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with each chapter and departure of the budget, they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of comunicacón and so spend a special attention.
The political discussions are much more interesting that simple numbers.
The Budgets of the state of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered three defects for this year in 2008 can not solve so easily:
The first of them is the high turnout of compulsory laws, so-called of expenditure leaders are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were adopted before the elections by the "silent" coalition of SSD and KSM.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first flaw.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, as the municipal and Community budget deficits.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the Budget deficit of the state.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of local and Community budget.
Many mayors to win other sources of investment, apart from the tax money, banks rates and credit, often, without sense, issued obligations which borrowed disproportionately to their local authorities.
In recent years managed to pay these debts through the massive sell-off of energy actions and other networks of development that received of the state and privatization.
Currently do not count on this resource.
If we stick only the official and verifiable facts, found that:
Our economy, because a few years ago through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which claims to SSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government were order to the state finances.
However, instead of this state followed borrow.
The rest of paises except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt economizaron much more reasonably that our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, particularly in the previous government.
We belong to nations within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why they are not necessary mass social programmes, unfortunately, in recent years inutilmente hincharon with huge measures.
Although managed to eliminate part of the expenditure incomprehensible populists approved before the elections this year, if shortly does not change the retirement age and pension reform will then really end of any policy in this country, and governs who governs only be a simple bureaucracy.
To exaggerate somewhat can say that politicians governing transform officials, mechanical repartidores most of the money of pension taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget can not be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal expenditure mandataries.
The deficit planned over 70 billion in the year 2008 would have been entirely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
There want politicians who govern only become officials we must therefore be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which realise that the state can only spend what is able to obtain taxes and charges, the calm for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only that enable the gradual achievement of a balanced budget of the state.

The banks want to resolve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks British, Swiss and Canadian decided together fight against the crisis of the market finance.
In the monetary markings will receive more than 100 billion dollars through licitaciónes.
In these tenders banks interest rates auctioned by which are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed sent to bid 40 billion dollars, and then another billion twenty-four the facilitate central banks in Europe and Swiss.
After the September 11 attacks, is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this process coordinated to protect and reduce the consequences of the crisis of finance.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, namely the contínuo growth of the scarcity of free capital that banks could provide" wrote in his report for customers, Bernard Baumohl the consultancy Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks fell probably the recession in the United States of 65% to 50%" added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already spent 60 billion dollars in unpaid appropriations, especially in the United States.
Economists ahead billions in losses.
The "central banks must have a real fear of what awaits them still when decided to take this step," said the main ABN economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"appears that the situation is really evil" added.
The central banks fear that have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and send the American economy recession with different impacts on the growth of the economóa world.
The central banks decided after flooded not reduce the so-called tariff LIBOR London interbanking tariff used for the market lending interbank.
This means that the banks feared constantly be money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain reduced their during the autumn of interest rates several times.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said to the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to inflame crisis because the fundamental problem does not solve the fall of the property market in the US.
Klaus: ecologists debates are incredible
Global climate change particularly affects paises development.
President Václav Klaus expressed again with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism arose now with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where presented his book Azúl, no green planet commented that ecologists debates are incredible.
Under Klaus is not only unacceptable the structure of the conference which creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the used rhetoric and reality.
"Back debates are hardly structured, fireworks of words, substitute for the solution to the current problems" Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important and therefore interested.
He expressed joy discover translated into German book as said "often I am only with a caricature of my ideas".
Now the stakeholders can be informed about their views varied.
Klaus recalled that is not a climatólogo but according to their opinion, has alleged enough to write a book as this.
It is academic, with the capacity to follow and judge a specialist speak, with statistics experiences and is also economist.
In the main closing moment expressed thought that the climate constantly changing and that its changes are normal, global warming there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not as great and serious, nor potential disasters represent and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costosamente unacceptable.
Furthermore as a man experimented with totalitarianism regards as unacceptable impose the views unproven others, which feels as a dangerous form of limiting the freedom of others.
these questions repeatedly explained that is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against the environmental activists who do not take account of the relationship between costs and benefits."
In the same issue Klaus spoke in Vienna already two months ago in the Institute Hayek.

Polívka not presented today hearings.
Under his lawyer the cause has probably not finished and their client recourse.
"lawsuit is that the Harabii and his team parasites Bolek popular Polívka" said after the process, the Polívka lawyer.
For him, before the words of Walachei Kingdom, everyone has been the image of the actor and comical.
The same idea has Harabii.

"After years I notice that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as our work parasites "added.
A lucrative business
Under the court the mark of Walachei Kingdom was used by first Polívka television programme.
In 1993 was capped by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then was not guide towards the creation of a fictitious wealth.
Some years after Harabii happened publish the passport from the Kingdom of Walachei.
From that comical origin was a business and a lucrative business which Harabii created after the Kingdom of Walachei society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of its name and signing in passports and even offered their holders discounted vistantes farm and assistants to their shows.

He however in the spirit of the project is Harabii and his team which devoted to this completely.
The cooperation between the descompuestas parties today, continued until 2000 when Harabii organised the crowning Polívka official Vsetín.
Since that time began to give conflicts between Polívka and Harabii whose culmination came with the removal of the "King Boleslav I, the elected by always".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabii resulted in the Jarmila uláková singer, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabii and its society until today has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring the tournament by the throne in the dispute with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabii.
the new King needs to be.

"We have no rush.
It should be something like the King towards Moravia.
The King should be elected in a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can stand "Harabii added.
Peugeot Test SW 207 1.6 VTi: outdated prejudices
To tell the truth I have never liked the Peugeotu too 206.
Its characteristics of march were never very much, the quality of the box of changes, manoeuvre and the product could also be characterised as below the average.
But now exists in the market his successor, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and myself, I just think better.
When probé the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, the masthead area backsides seat.
But that would be the only complaint because the Combi bodywork means in this respect, which I will not suffer before the two metres.
Flying by the world
Step by the internal very quickly too not repeat it.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the central poor tunnel.
Here more assessed the invention of design as the car seems quite elegant.
comfortable seats, times remain above that we complained short seats and supports.
Also unlike the model 206, lateral leadership has improved considerably.
What the area? and here can feel how measures have grown bodywork.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned shortage of masthead area.
boot Maletas
But the main vehicle boot.
This I must evaluate as very accessible (by backsides abatible portón) and a well distributed storage.
The dead spaces is equipped with rubber correas represent an ideal solution.
No, and bother can spread to restrain heavy objects.
But let us stand in the tank.
Under the tables, basic regime has a capacity for 428 litres in comparison with competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type more sold in the Czech Republic, the koda Combi Fabia.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, found that Peugeot is behind with their 52 perceptible litres.
abroad holiday or placing buggy its value of the child is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then quote the floor that quite level after the overthrow supports of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tests car was equipped with a encedido injection of four valves on a 1.6 capacity l and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth and should seem a 1600 menospreciara family five doors.
It is silent, little and especially consumed, has momentum.
If we compare with the era of the ikoda then that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe were taponado rag, I can say that this can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we tests gracefully equipped with a vehicle and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with heated injection of 1400 329.900 Crowns can still be.
Our aggregates put from 410.900 SEK, which is already too.
The kind Premium already tests reaches 80 other kroner.
Only still tendriamos headwaters airbag air conditioning automatic, windscreen automatic automated backrooms windows...
In other words, with all the car of all 531.900 costs kroner.
It is much, but commands supplements in the team Fabia and will reach far similar.
Now just decide which of the two marks.

The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a woman Slovakian was hitting sticks to a ten-year student with a yardstick green.
In its defence said that the child was fools her child with insults racist tone.
The police had to act after an attack of age girls minor against a migrant Slovak.
Girls agasajaron racist abuse and jettisoned stones.
"When we were home, a lad came to us stopping the bus and began to spitting.
When I said you quit did us shrug embark apples and pears and then fell trousers and showed us its backsides "described another unpleasant incident to The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints on both sides.
One of the native even appointed the conflict with the migrants Europe as fight for survival.
The cases mentioned already show us as the environment in English schools starting to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70 Slovaks came elsewhere work-related.
About some 30,000 Slovak students attend the English schools.

At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
Havana became warehouse and port of burden of the treasures that the Spanish staffing in America and led to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the 1920.
What sent building one of the leaders of the American mafia, Luke Luciano, because all that it had crime in America (and therefore prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.

In Havana tall buildings emerged, comfortable avenues dealt cars that were a symbol of religion in the 1950 s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway were bought a finance in San Francisco, Paula near Havana, and Cojimar was yacht.
In the walls of Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of the world of entertainment and politicians of all America.
And today?
In the walls of the habanense Bodeguita you can also leave his autograph.
In the bar of the National Hotel expensive cocktail mixed under their wishes.
And those cars already of worship of the 1950 s, until today still functioning by Havana, because those Lada and Fiat reached long ago have already been corroded between these humid and salty winds.
Even if Havana, especially the old district is deteriorating considerably, does not exist in the vicinity many wonderful colonial monuments as apart.
Other places beauty metamorfosean, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings both necessary money, developing this guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years grew new hotels not only in Havana but also Varadero on the coast of the province of Holguín and islands as Coco Cayo Guillermo Cayo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity in the world only and is very adulated by lovers of the railways.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations until sugar factories vias close steam or electrical machines.

Mogotes pilones chalk rock and rocks of high escarpados in the caidas of the valley, and their grutas fertile land aclimatan thanks to which form roquedales behind dense vegetation.
The valley is where farm, probably higher quality tobacco in Cuba.
On visiting some of the factories habaneras cigars can be found with its final product.
Perhaps someone suits interesting rodó apart from the range Chilean, the Mayor Zeman.
Trinidad
City of old pedigree was founded not long after the Spanish colonizaran the island.
The slavery and sugar brought fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with buildings in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers arrivals later, in just four centuries has changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and sierra Escambray so paragraph still in the 1950 s of the last century no road to join with the rest of the country.
Such a isolation helped to remain outside the rest.
Nothing new was built and, therefore, nothing destroyed, since every person was happy to have where live.
If it is more time to be in Trinidad that a single late worth places in the vicinity close interesting known as the Beach Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.

Baracoa
Small city in the extreme west of Cuba, some considered as the most beautiful of the island.
With this view security is already confirmed by own way.
The two roads arriving from above Guantánamo must go high and quebradas mountains, how by nature hardly knows the action of man.
This Eastern Cuba has been included as heritage of humanity by UNESCO with its unspoiled nature.

Today Comparaba front of a court Khartoum to have given a name to a cute bear
The British teacher judged in Sudan insult to Islam has been condemned Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum 15 days of imprisonment and expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left pupils from 6 to 7 years to give the name Mahomet cute bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illicit.

Mohamed is of course the name of the Prophet Muslim, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then children have made a book to the photo the kind of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear - itself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.

Opinion divided by many pupils of the teacher of school described as "very careful towards their pupils" and "ever speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the Mohamed name is the second name more given in Britain, is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name by Muslim families often elegigo is a way to honour the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of the name?
Can we for example give it to a plaything?

spectacular Reparations on the space station
I will have lack over seven hours of work in the space astronaut Scott Parazynski and his colleagues from the international space Station crew (ISS) to make the spectacular repair of a panel torn solar and indispensable to the continuation of scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, away from the modules livable, the speed with which was thought, "chapuceados" instruments for astronauts to make repair.
The problem Tuesday appeared that astronauts had released from the shuttle Discovery module Harmony a chunky piece cilíndrica responsible for soon welcoming European scientists laboratories and Japanese (see framed).
This module is a type of platform landing for the módulos-laboratorios.
But we must be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore move a module of electricity production with solar panels weighed 17.5 tonnes already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
Having shifted, the crew began the reorganization of solar panels of module which have a major 76 metres.
This is where one of the panels, which are deployed as acordeones, has been damaged in little more or less of a metre by a cable atrancó.
The deployment has been stopped not to damage the panel more.
The astronauts, which had at the outset make an exit from the shuttle Discovery control, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was flawed, were forced to concentrate on the panel damaged.
It is Scott Parazynski who has been elected to go to caracolear at the end of the 30 metres of the arm of the remote-controlled shuttle added to the station to make repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space andador) Nasa.

The choice of Quo statu
No surprise on Sunday, the departure of the ballot box: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Poutine Russia united.
Confirmando their quest for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin them today addressed to voters a televised message on public channels, already but whose content is kept secret.
The as leader of the list for Russia united, the party pro-Kremlin whose overwhelming reveals.
Yesterday, President left nothing transparentar receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting with deliver a new burden against the West accused of interference - predilection subject during the campaign.
We know "the price of a true democracy and wish honest elections, more transparent and more open, without incident elections" added.
Under the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
accuse a campaign by tarnished pressures.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that no "never had so dirty elections, until at the time of Eltsin".

Is Prime Minister?
Is head of the parliamentary majority and the extremely powerful party united Russia elegería the government and the president?
Whatever the legislative elections as the presidential power outgoing triumph.
It is a tradition.
The "Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus do not feel masters of their destiny," the sociologist Lev Goudkov esteem, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Kopossov Nikolaï, state university of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society in this country delayed cristianizado five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the training of individualism.
After liberal reforms of the 1990 s, "Poutine restored the model of a nanny state, fully accepted by the population because this new paternalism was not followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic confession," esteem María Lipman of the Carnegie Endowment.
Today the Russians forego "own" personal responsibility of those who had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect"?
The phenomenon touches all social classes, including the world of the issues.
And the administrative élite think preserve the statu quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) run local lists of a united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990 s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians not vote by the extremists.
Completing Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a professor of age of 54 years: "Do reflect?
Will they are to power are not too poor, change them "?

This announced press conference of the PSOE Organization secretary, José White, and the Bono, after the meeting that has kept midday in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".

This approach requires explain why action, or inaction, his government have contributed significantly to Spain heading the EU breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has happened and why your government, the contract with the planet, it has not stopped.
Moreover, required to explain the maximum clarity to the Spanish what measures will take to slow down climate change.
What companies will be affected, citizens habits must be changed, individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences.
So, who is sacrificed and who pay to save the planet.
There have been or will be these explanations.
Precisely because it is sacrificed and to pay.
The measures against climate change, the real action unpopular.
Costosas uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until petrol penny suggested by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to electorally Zapatero has been quick to deny it.

What insurance it suits me?
The motor vehicle, which covers the driver before possible disasters, represents a major expenditure will depend on a number of factors, such as age, sex, card age, civil state, the kind of vehicle to ensure or the use of this, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
choose the right motor insurance is even more difficult to choose the model of vehicle.
First needs to be clear what we are talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment materialize in a contract of insurance, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for do responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which sets bearing in mind various factors, such as age, sex, card age, civil state, the kind of vehicle to ensure or the use it, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices in accordance with the statistics, so that more likely to suffer from an accident, greater quota to pay.
It is for that reason that both elderly of 25 as women have to pay lower premiums, because statistics reflect that have a lower rate of accidents due to its prudence.
Similarly, throwing stock hand, companies have come to the conclusion that people married tend to have fewer accidents that drivers singles.
The use of the vehicle influence the frequency, and with it in the probability of having any kind of hitch.
By increasing frequency increase the chances.
There are many variables that insurance have in mind when setting the price of the premium.
That is why, that the driver was well to study the situation to choose that motor vehicle that best complies with their profile.
We will make here the most significant variables to choose one or another kind of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
The young children of 25 years with various disadvantages are at the time of insurance at a reasonable price, such as the low driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well secured is a safe to any risk, there are other more economic choices.
The more cautious drivers can opt for an entire risk franchise, to get insurance cover all risk but at a price more workable.
This sort of convention would mean that the client pay a part of the amount of the disaster.
"part of the amount of the sinister provides the customer preestablecerá depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher terms lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, responsible than First Europe in Spain, insurance mediator on-line.
Another option is a safe from extended, so that the customer ensures protection before damage to third parties, but not before the caused in their own car.
Moreover, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are less than 25 years tries to be careful and avoid claims to the extent possible, because this will have an impact on the payment, potentially reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basic tariff which has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty a surcharge on this charge basis.
"bonuses and penalties depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company has had a good year can afford to be increased subsidies, "clarifies Noguera.
Gaza 25 drivers do easier in a insurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced by the experience.
For this reason, it is more desirable hire a whole franchise risk.
"normally young people can not make use of experience previously when stand in an accident, and even when driving," claims in Spain's director of the European company, which adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, once last 'fear novice'.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children is preferable to negotiate a safe to any risk, provided their economic situation permitting, is clear.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with lower rate of accidents, so that surcharges fewer.
In this case, the best insurance would be one to any risk franchise (able to this EUR 300), or when available a high level of bonus, one third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
They have been "by looser driving and have greater purchasing power to afford to assume greater number of franchise," ruling Noguera Luis.
For the retired insurance is commendable to any risk franchise (and that is of EUR 150), or one third extended when having a high level of bonus.
It must be said that the motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before sinister possible, but also because it represents a major expenditure, which is why it is vital to study the safe properly that suits us more according to our personal situation.

The Italian adds ten points and certificaron already in the fifth day with a tie happens in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but another still needs to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, which has four, not forward.

Thus, this group will be concluded before the rest and tied Giuseppe Meazza outcome seems more expected, although the two teams dealt out for a victory, because the Italians will not speculate at home and Celtic knows that winners would be first and ensure better eighth crossing.
At the whole of Gordon Strachan might even serve it a defeat for classifying if the Shakhtar but, nonetheless, can not rely because equal nine points pass Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.

While awaiting the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar only applies the triumph, in the case of losing Celtic, both to throw eighth as to continue UEFA.

New fears about the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute for the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk of affecting the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of the gas by Russia exported to the European Union (EU) is addressed through Ukraine, so that each roce between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher rates of transit.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to the states of the EU.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow wine with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state monopoly master of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the amount of money should pay for Ukraine by the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that charging more to Ukraine, because it has pledged to pay a 50% in 2008 extra gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that could be that Ukraine pays a 40% more for the import of Gazprom.
"It is important for us use our arguments as one of the most important for gas transits during the talks" Finance Minister said Anatoly Ukrainian Kinakh Reuters news agency.
The "changes in gas prices should not be linked to our arguments on the levels of transit charges [towards Western Europe] Ukraine" route.
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supply of the EU.
Russia has of the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own with gas supplies of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "must prove to foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs control criminal records of employees from outside Europe, said a vigilant.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black came after found that a doctor foreigner was related to the attack on the Glasgow airport, in June.
Black also showed its concern that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign personnel to account.
However, deriving indicated other controls carried out properly by means of a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor chequeó the amount of foreign staff outside the European economic area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Abdullah Bilal, 28, a doctor of Iraq's Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after clashing jeep in the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who did in the Bailey Old video conference in October, accused in relation to the alleged car bombings in Britain.
NHS expected to carry out the employment pre-pre-agreement checkups candidates, to ensure that meet qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in Britain.
Although the junta of Scotland health uses "Scotland Disclosure" to carry out the criminal controls, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The deriving general auditor, among other measures, recommends that together should have the Criminal guide Records bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although find some of the personal records evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says deriving.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with their own policies of employment, but says that: "our report highlights the areas which can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of staff from abroad NHS".
The chairman of the BMA Scotland, Dr Peter Terry said that it was "very unlikely" screening pre-empleo can identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"deriving suggests that screening pre-empleo operating in Scotland NHS but it is not clear what added value of the recommendations made," explained.
Scottish authorities in health declare that currently have 1.161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because together have problems in identifying what employees have indefinite authorisations of residence.
The research also found that verification procedures established by the authorities in NHS Ayrshire and Arran Grampian Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian, were fulfilling widely.
This includes passport controls, work permits and skills check-up.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-empleo beacon of foreigners in the NHS.
The Secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon states: "had a great interest to carry out this work following the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport.
He that the Scottish government, together with the boards of health, could consider the recommendations of the papers and that this will be reflected in updating of control pre-empleo guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which had planned published next month.

Venus Climate can provide an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have been once an appropriate place for life, declared scientific yesterday.
The data for a European spaceship into orbit showed the planet more similar to a sister of the earth from what had been previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to the earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus slightly is closer to the sun.
It makes millions of years, Venus could have taken similar conditions made a habitable planet on earth, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and solar rotation slower to Venus sent a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is sufficient to melt lead and eroded by hurricane winds and rays storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus businesses--some, who has studied the planet by a year, provides a picture of how the earth could develop catastrophic changes by the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, the Department of Physics Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus businesses--some states: "being clarifying why the climate Venus is so different from the Earth, when they are two very similar planets.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in Venus began as the earth, possibly with an environment habitable makes millions of years".

Even remains open
Mitt Romney say that it is not worthy that the presidential candidates respond questions of a monkey snow.
However, the Republicans candidate for the presidency possibly entrants to hold a debate YouTube ordinary voters in taped video questions and sent for its dissemination between the candidates.
None of the questions tabled in the evening of Wednesday 28 November were most ridiculous that the snowy monkey that asked democrats about global warming in the debate on the republican party YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the republican party in view of the elections next year.
There knows exactly how the producers of CNN co-patrocinan the debate, the videos chose YouTube to show prospective candidates.
But the first half-hour debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focusing on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful clichés for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters rise dial when listen ideas that agradaran them: issuers of approval peaks note when the candidate spoke with extremist arguments.
The exchanges of tough words in the evening were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr Romney, which has been frontrunner in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of the Romney it was soft illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
It attacked to Mr Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts to recruit illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded when they aggressively asked whether any candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing illegal regularize their situation and by giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
The minor candidates as Duncan Hunter, a congressman Californian, Tom Tancredo Congressman Colorado, managed agreement with the issue.
None has the floor nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both blew on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share points of view: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This cliché, together with the fear of toxic toys of China and other concerns about the outside, Republican aid to forget, or minimise, divisions between liberals and conservative Christians.
But the debate transformed uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr Guiliani asked why had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed about whether the water immersion should be considered a torture.
A person asked whether the candidate believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr Giuliani to encounter the position that while the Bible was their favorite book, not literally believed in the history of the Jonás and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the most recent survey of Iowa, thanks to its long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When was pressure to respond if Jesus would be in favour, laughed saying that it was too intelligent Jesus as candidate in the elections.
The race unusually remains open.
The Mr Huckabee increases Iowa coincidentemente fundraising campaigns of the liberal Ron Paul, and their heated statements of the debate on Wednesday.
They two have been from the bottom, because both sides of the party did not reach agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winner message on the grandeur of America, satisfaction of both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Dolores
Gordon Brown has discovered hole sink; but equally emerging
As the political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not appear to have sold influences, or exhorbitantes question of accounts in Paris hotels, nor chupadas fingers out of wedlock.
But revealed that a rich man business has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party, more than 650 pounds (1.3 million dollars), by almost four years using false names and not denounced the party.
Two months ago, when Prime Minister dodged to call a choice, the British intelligence puerile fools declaring that opinion polls not induced in its decision, the hope was to provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of this, as Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr Brown has gone from Stalin Mr Bean.
The rescue Northern Rock, a bank in problems, demonstrated the regulatory weakness and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Out proposals to change the code of tax made business groups, together, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data revealed an administrative unimaginable shoddiness.
A trio retired general launched a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: ministers of the armed forces, demanded a part-time employment.
Now they are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watts, the Secretary General Labour (and complicit previous) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown to walk irrevocably towards the departure.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People do not believe them as politicians, but usually suspend its disbelief when a new batch assumes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister can not improve matters, not less long, that suspension of more: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers presents; the press seeks bad news; and the government puts defensive and not approached.
Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders can not be defended arguing that is new.
Although I would renege on Tony Blair, was their superior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and tax on registration authority, are related to the decisions Brown did as chancellor of the purse.
Even when it is not directly wrapped in the Blairish setbacks - or "effective partners," research on the financing of political parties - the voters can assume that if.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As Mr Bean, nobody has died, nor has been directly cheated.
And, although painful remedy is to give the course Stalinistas trends in Mr Brown have always promised: a brutal and reliable government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, that their comparison with donations of charity handouts, says that it does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision not takes.
Laws against the anonymity for the major political taxpayers is clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
Mr Watts, who said aware of the Mr Abraham agreement, and that this was not illegal, obviously face Mendlesohn Jon fundraising leader asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not so far involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of the payments was after him to take control of the office in June.
Until now the prime minister has half of work.
It was quick to condemn his party violate the law, but it wither in decision-making by a family affair, a committee of inquiry on the matter - driven largely by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been raped, is a matter of the police.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, as finding a permanent and independent head for Standards Committee public administration, because it has not had one for six months, and must also push for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a cooperative hard work of the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation has with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan as Mr Brown.
But he must tackle some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way that it can move victory act with a neat probity and a strong competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis in mortgages subprime is the American market infecting of credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that fins dorsales around naden emotional.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed in the market in the country of credit cards.
The analysts Goldman Sachs estimate that credit cards losses can reach the 99 millions of dollars if mortgages crisis subprime infects other forms of consumer credit.
signs of infection are already.
There is an increase in both card charges as rates of crime, measuring the proportion of the balances not covered or who have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced the last month that has taken 1.4 million from financing to the American consumer in his business, partly because of the weakness of the providers of the cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
The default and crime are low levels.
According to Moody's rating agency, the third quarter crime rate 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of people (2005) gave rise to a sharp downturn in the applications of bankruptcy, themselves represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore late) would be growing again, or can happen that the conditions for borrowers were deteriorating.
The industry also delivers strong charges, which show how much of their debts consumers pay every month.
confidence in credit cards and values backed by assets is quite firm, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney TowerGroup, a signature researcher, predicted that volumes of emissions for the year 2007 will be around 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between the subprime mortgages and the market of credit cards certainly exists: consumers of debts like burdening credit cards now that credit institutions are ending.
But issuers of the credit card look far more the flow of liquidity asset values, so that prices accionan not necessarily a change in the creditor capacity of borrowers.
They can even work to outflank issuers.
The incentives for consumers continue to pay off mortgage decreasing if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and, as the result of the debt payment of the card rises in the list of priorities.
Broadcasters of cards can also respond rapidly and flexibly to difficult conditions for mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering balances creditors.
That theory should reduce the risk of a rapid retasación of assets.
"We will not awaken a day again and evaluate all loans," says Gary Perlin, the head of finance Capital One.
If a sudden infection in the subprime market of credit cards is unlikely, the risks of sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch drive America recession, industry undoubtedly faces a tougher future.
We must continue to monitor these dorsales finning.
British Banqueros guilty in Enron
Three British bankers who were trial for its responsibility in the fraud with the former head of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.

Fastow is serving a judgment of six years in a federal Louisiana prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars that required to live in the United States while celebrated the trial.

The collapse did lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in stock market and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned guilty the years for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a condemnation of over 24 years.
The Lay sentence for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died from a heart attack last year.

If persists the upward trend increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for property and business Kohn said.
The comments were taken investors as a sign that the reserve list is injecting fresh capital in the markets of USA and subsequent cuts in the interest rate to stabilize conditions of the credit.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the economy of the USA, as sales of houses reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the Financial Turmoil was accentuated by a warning Stearns Bear investment bank cut off 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of their total workforce, in an overall reduction in costs to compensate for the losses of their investments in mortgages sub-prime in the US.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts entering London, where the bank employs 1500 people.

Britain takes trial demands for Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who must strike No 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, does Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important against the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection lending - with this particular title, at least here to help Peter Moores the coach, Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk Hugh Morris, Director of the England, is beginning to fill offers to become national dials, and, if not one part time.
The not succeeds breaks the sixth place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport.
It is not easy to throw a man at the top of their profession, while another will never more cross the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck than capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult because trials need always end up being subjective.
Is the right time Bopara be lifted?
Is it fair to Shah if he?
The same question could be done in another aspect, says if John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two young brilliant executives with good degrees and familiar business, had to be promoted at the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player unless give the opportunity to sink or swim the following chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but also have opportunities.
In a team, a player cricket must capture the eye of the captain at the same time to take a wicket and a bateador to achieve opportunities to change the order if you want to have impact as a player one day.
But capture the eye of the seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many improved last season, for example, James Anderson, it plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison fit states and bowls like wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 wickets first class 33 for each careers to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 average, but both have had its high times and can expect more than they.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium Asgiriya can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or the race for a man, or can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did well in the first wickets 5 and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood struggling to establish at the same time who went to become a player in importance, and despite observe double% against Australia in Australia, may be even underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion today Asgiriya stage, will continue to its instincts of conservation and favor more experience of Shah on the young Bopara exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
Shah for the brilliant and valuable evidence of debut principles of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first class against only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes against the bowling spin.
But Shah did only ten careers in its two shifts in May against West Indies Lords test, his home as player Middlesex, and that caused immediate rejection of the selectores when Vaughan called its place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken batting something élan in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie vivre on swords.
He according for nothing in the field of cricket and its attitude was summary as turned his vehicle in an exhibition for car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
Sufrió minor injuries, and a shock presumably, but the first thing was draw their Vodafone (sponsored course) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow team looking to the distance, to say excitement: "Is this Viste?".
Bopara is the best player, including their slippery happens to its effects games seem met, because batea with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
My inclination would give Bopara opportunity, which does not mean that Shah sobresalga not, as the leaves suggest tea, it is he who here plays this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles without were effective, without visa extensions and hoped that the city returned to normality.
Some even had returned to combat the militants led outside their homes.
In the Mansour buses station, even before the advent of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy government composed of a dozen buses terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killed many doctors in Baghdad," al-Qubaisi says Sabah, Sunni doctor.
"again today by what I saw in TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what happened in Baghdad and is now insurance."
They say "that the Mahdi Army ceased to kill people," states, referring to the militia Shiite of the militant religious Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered their troops a cessation momentarily.
Qassim Atwani Shiite 38 years and professor in the area of Sunni Amariyah again with its two children because it was impossible renew their visa in Syria because the regime does not want the Iraqi working in their country.
Their Shi'a neighbours Amariyah called by phone to say that a force ally of USA helped to al-Qaeda outside their bastion west of the capital, and urgieron again.
One of the newcomers of Jordan was the head of a tribe Sunni and Shiite that had been led from their home Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, which then urged people to be lifted against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and I said that they had begun a militia anti-stance Sleikh al-Qaeda and needed my support and my colleagues".
"I have again today," Sabaah declared Alu Obeidi 62.
Many people said be swayed by the increased calm in the capital since troops from USA afianzaran groups of "citizens concerned," armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared having again by the denial of visas and lack of money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai 51 years and three children father, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shi'a, asked the Syrian Government impose restrictions on refugees visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country because of the death sectarian cliques.
"were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to fail to give the Iraqi visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"can not believe in a government that supports the criminals who fire my home after the left".
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from the Shi'a areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees makes again arise sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The small Saar, good education.
The smaller federal state is the first in vocational training and even conspicuous by the international orientation of its colleges.
As throughout the country sarlandeses only lack an educational field.
"yesterday 58 explained because no sarlandés we are franseses" - that was the ironic motorcycle on themselves from the smallest federal state cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a major role in the education system of the Saar that a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" held the fifth place.
In this way, colleges by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The Saarbrücken university was melted in 1948 by the franseses.
Until the students today can end their university career with two or three dipolmas.
For consequence, nickel of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 hundreds.
However, the number of students from the Saar is greater than the average in colleges. Many of them have no bacillerato.
"In the Saar exploits the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke experte educational sector in the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
Over every five young baccalaureate Vocational School. so that the Saar 7% points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for education is very broad profesional-académica.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of population, is the second better in Germany.
Despite the practical training and a growing demand, the number of Science Ingeniería graduates fell one-third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education in the Saar forced schools higher to advertising specialities in Science Ingeniería.
"After the first PISA study conducted some reforms in schools in general education," states spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
This government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children quickly begin to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. meanwhile, this model also imitate the other federal estades.
The comparison with the next studies show whether has increased the performance of the pupils.
According to the report PISA 2003, the number of pupils behind in development school desminuyó 29 to 20%.
However, in general, the Saar not much improved as other federal states.
In Bavaria, pupils know better calculation.
To displeasure sarlandeses, the report PISA not compares the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field could achieve good results.
Although the sarlandeses are not French, the language of neighbours is still compulsory in Secondary Education Institutes.

"My dignity does not allow me," says, Chávez propulsando a constitutional reform where citizens of the country oil must decide on Sunday in a referendúm.
With this reform could quite extend their power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chávez in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas that it was the release of the hostages.
Sunday Chávez said criticising that the decision taken Uribe has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain talk a lot about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called sensational in the country: "Why not you callas?" is the phrase that have already unloaded half a million people.

In 2007 the reduction of wages real threat to the Germans.
According to a prognosis, this year a reduction in wages real threat to the German employees despite a strong juncture.
The experts presented a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, German employees should have in 2007 with a real cuenta-salario lower than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of salaries, the increase in the VAT and estirón food and energy prices," the paper reported "Bildt" Gustav Horn Macroeconomía and Research Institute of economic cycles.
Also new burdens of unemployment insurance can reciprocate employees.
The Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Ostanbrücker Neue Zeitung" given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance 3.3% to move from year to year, it is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the office of work must not be getting involved again in an unpleasant situation, asking credits and subsidies for the federal state, according to the words of a political party German Social Democrat.
Tuesday was public that the rate of inflation with the explosion of prices in the area of food and the sector of petroleum reached the highest level for 13 years.
compare prices with the past year, they are increasing 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suited to life, Venus is the planet more similar to the earth, something which has not yet had raised. The European probe "Venus businesses--some" discovered in the atmosphere rays and the poles remolinos, the same also appear in winter on Earth.
Since three decades ago researchers had the suspicion of there may be rays downfall.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: discovered electromagnetic waves on the verge of atmosphere. In Venus the rays of a height cayen of 54 kilometres and a cloud behind another Cris account Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles scientific "magazine Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the lives of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on earth: the storms could have led reactions in the ocean, which had led to amino acids that the basic components of life.
In Venus is not the case: if one day there life, that would have to be one of the first developments states, "Have explains Solomon of the Institution Carnegie in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus should not be life: the air pressure is almost 100 times higher than in the earth and the surface temperatures sway 500° C, ranging so that can be achieved freezing temperatures.
"Possibly, Venus is a" diabolical sister "of the Earth, but it remains a sister," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus businesses--some" is to respond to the question of why Venus, so similar to the earth for its mass and size, has had such a different development.
As since the 1990 had not Special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the Venus research.
The recent results of research will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of researchers, not only highlight the unity of Venus System Solar.
"This desmuestra that planets neighbours have more common characteristics with the earth had supposed" informs the ESA.
Despite the familiar stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region vórtice formed by the clouds tour faster.
This phenomenon reminds the flow of wind in high atmospheric land sections of the poles, as describes a team of Giuseppe Piccioni researchers in the Italian Institute in Physics and Special Astrofísica Space.
The second of the planet Solar System mass has almost as the earth and equatorial diameter of 12 kilometres is almost as large.
This world also drawn evening star or dawn star orbit around the Sun almost 225 days.
But his period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus amounts to 243 days on earth.
Although Venus with their superficial 460 degrees temperatures and air pressure 92 bars not much resembles the earth, scientists are based on the notion that both planets had been created in the same conditions.
In the two planets had been patchwork water on earth was in the oceans, but Venus is dissociated in the universe.
While the earth carbon dioxide had become stones in Venus form of carbon, most of the atmosphere.

"the summit of Integration until the Conference of Islam: all this is already yielding its first fruits".
It is still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same problems edificatorios and sociological as in France.
Young conducted serious unrest in the streets with the police north of Paris past nights.
Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the chairman of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat in view of the riots in France, warns copier effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.

Kolat underlines: "We need to prospects for young".
The chairman of the Turkish Community added that in Germany than in France "there is a great social control in families," that the French country greater.
Moreover, the majority of young foreign origin does not destroy what they had built their parents here.
Kolat feels: "But despite all, we must be careful".
We need to "opportunity to young people to receive more rapid job or vocational training".
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel went in a peaceful manner.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew the territory.
The responsible authorities informed three arrests, as well as of rubbish and burnt-out cars.
From the day before a team of nearly 1,000 police is dealing with the security.
Having seen a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Home Affairs Minister, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.

In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The actions very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that there is nothing to expect more of it.
But what country Chancellor really live?
After his desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House must say: it does not live in the country which should be governed by it.
As for the reproach did for having repeatedly on actions in foreign policy, Chancellor rejected with a phrase unpretentious.
He said that this would be a parochial and thus showed did note that does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House declared clearly expressed all that this reproach was right.
It could not be felt or a minimum interest, nor any kind of sentiment by the problems of the country.
But instead of this Wolke Angela came in this way: a very high policy fleeing in foreign policy and lose there achieve anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: praised itself commensurately by the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but does nothing about how they should be made here these goals in matters of climate.
In general, this way to praise itself - for two years the leader of the Party of the Union Demócratocristiana not been able to allow such modesty.
Because obstinately expressions to reach impetus to the people.
its public image harms by the pragmatic conception solve the problems without going about the bush.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke internal problems are aparencias little value.
Is poverty of children and concerns about the low-wage workers?
All is devoted to talk about this issue using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how often is wrong to talk when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to make a more or less good phrase.
It is beginning to encounter "as if it were in an unknown territory," when it was more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate pre-candidate Republican presidential YouTube and should only now fear a candidate of the outside.
Since a principle tensions between the candidates noticed.
Mitt Romney its enemy criticised Rudy Giuliani that had become to New York in "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
This, for its part, responded with serious reproaches: "I would say that its own house was a" port "for illegal" Giuliani replied to the ex-governador Massachustes saying that he who was used illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to the attacks: as hitherto Republican group has no clear front-runner, the eight presidential pre-candidate exploit the debate on CNN, especially to discredit his adversaries.
Small videos of 30 seconds internet usarios road that were sent to, nor Youtube have much content.
"With this isolation we leave Hitler come to power," that was the reproach John McCain Ron Paul adversary, the only meeting insisted immediately withdraw troops from Iraq.
Romney also gets a lot of criticism from the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when refuses to acknowledge as torture the "Waterboarding" a method of interrogation, leave drowning a person simulated his death.
The reactions of the public in the House St. Petersberg in Florida show that while the most important issues of the campaign are other, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public applauded always very strong when the conservativos values who praised and denied the increase in taxes.
This better can see where are the weaknesses of both favourite.
"In that time I mistakenly," Romney explained compungido and calls on the people forgiveness and the public television for having been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Instead, Giuliani did not say when asked thought about the bible literal interpretation.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was swearing as president.
This have just eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The Thursday Pervez Musharraf, chairman of Pakistan, took juramiento for a second term of 5 years.
The Pakistani television in direct conveyed the ceremony in the Presidential Palacio in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf was sworn respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday flowed its mandate of the army chief Ashfaq confidante Kiyani and accepted the international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after it did with power with a military bloodless coup, ex-general first governs the state as chief civil.
With its renunciation of the post of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the general tax of the state, after the Musharraf juramiento will soon cancel the state of emergency and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since were proclaimed state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many supporters lawyers Musharraf. The last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all resources before the new elections controversial from the head of the government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the region of the North Watiristán, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
Under information from the spokesman of the army a bomb exploded on the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Again the founders of Krautrock.
The most famous German gang of the 1970 continues his activity: three members of "Harmonia" in a concert participated in Berlin.
As reestreno made a copy of "Live 1974" that it was written in the best era of the band.
Back in those times were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has with its cajita, their cables and especially its buttons.
In the environment is sitting Dieter Moebius has 63 years and dress with a white shirt.
Michael left Rother 57 years, which has its portable computer and guitarra.
In the right, looking of the audience Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the panel of controls.
Each contributes their sounds, including there is even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother Mr.
Something very exciting for passionate Krautrock was the fact that the gang Harmonia again music.
What we need to reveal here is: questions precisely have shown that the name of the gang retumbaba in the minds of the people, but it was not something very as after 32 years the public extrañase so.
But why German can not also applaud alive legend of the 1970 s?
Especially since the misunderstanding Kautrock was always more enhanced in England and the United States in their own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a prize music, "Echo" members of the Can 2003 gang of Cologne for his work of life in the room could see the faces by surprise of artists pop German.
And when Network Hot Chili Peppers thanked band The Düsseldorf und Neu. all opened the mouth with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother happening in the time during the concerts scenario Hot network Chili Peppers as if it had been an old friend (band).
The ignorance in their country and recognition abroad, one thing.
It is a problem remind this band, because the triad existed only two years and in those days do not a great effect on the public, but subsequently obtained through the others.
Already Moebius time and Roedelius had done with the artist music Schnitzler Conrad and had a name Cluster promised much reputation.
At the beginning tocaban in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, worked with a music company Duesseldorf was patronizada by a church.
For a while, Rother had a trabajillo Kraftwerk and worked after guitarrista band Neu! He improve the reputation for this German band in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed musicians in exile Cluster Forst Weserbergland.
There, Alten Weserdorf ruin of the sixteenth century, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological Comune I, where Roedelius could complain about its position.
That was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
According to say, a day appeared a flag of song association Harmonia Ottenstein waste, which proved to be a good name for art.
There were disadvantages in the use of the Harmonia name.
The first albúm called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "Lux".
Although the music was calm and simple, the gang had financial problems.
The life as artist was not only to know itself.
The "Live 1974 CDs" was during a concert engraved in Griessem. Some recalls that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed its wish to push through Harmonia and occasionally trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the habits.
In 1975 the gang announced its separation.
Rother ended engaged in matters of esoterismo and secured its existence álbumes as "Herzen Flammende".
Cluster revived the 1980 s and more has been from that time was successful Harmonia.
The direct recording of the albúm Griessmer, we must thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland was as a goal cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as music alive.
As the work of Roedelius band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidised with public measures in the Wordtronics festival.
There Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also present Dr Motte Loveparade the inventor.
In this way, all influences Krautrock to the next pop are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a súper-banda, because it was vacuum.
The phrase of Brian Eno accompanied with the special music fills the chamber: "This music is the only certain music, she partenece fúturo".
There are photos where appears Harmonia producers in a holding.
The history of the development of the legend in the projections is black-and-white photos, which are cables instruments.
There are three fund veterans began to improvise again.
Not do nothing but setting microphones body and the battery to be able to produce extra tones with the help of the effects equipment that had built with their own hands.
Currently the electronic music and had to be.
Three people expand on the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, in an environment music is coughs susurra and a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was already always an English term of origin.
But it was never rock.
There sought the origin of the gender blues, but in schools in music (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains the calm.
In the scenario is well reflecting on what is already clear.
Where begins and where music just?
This one can break the nerves or gift rapid moments of luck.
Richard Gere only more lacks cynicism.
The two films "The Party Hunting" and "Moerderischer" Frieden again devoted to war in the Balkans.
But both were not much conviction.
Either the concepts are set much in actions and tirotes or two films are demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with their "The Hunting" Party can not help in this case.
At the beginning, there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark inside the country during the war in Bosnia, was found again on Richard Gere player.
Finally had lost sight man more beauty of the 1980 s, because nobody wanted seen after their pleasant roles and minor films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Party Hunting - when a hunter becomes pursued" (Why today the titles of films must be so long and egregious?).
The movie has a wonderful presentation for view: basically, its role of reporter in the war is the presentation of what could make Richard Gere, if the destiny and the film industry had not been so satiated with him. He were a man whose better days of life became already, as a monument to ruin of its decline maintained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting" Party, despite this triumph, with "Moerderischer" Frieden that the German production and also be presented this week, are only be a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
You can tell the film "Moerderischer" Frieden in short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol Max Riemelt) that they want to save a Serbian francotiradores Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads to the enamore it.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, but welcome the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German "number Alarm taking 11" without motorway, but in a state of war.
In the example of "The Hunting" Party can be investigated, because in reality there were never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
In another time, with another director and with another author indent (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about the American reporters in the war are to detect a war criminal Serbian so-called fox ", probably could be a new" NOW Now-type ".
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: small teams are twice the mountains to implement something that can not make the army and becoming a trip on folly.
One reason for the failure of "The Party Hunting" at the beginning we are Simon Hunt who leave not simply be a cynical with heart.
No, the script also provides a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian we are going to kill.
Then "The Hunting" Party is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieve what could not achieve five years NATO, the CIA and all hunters of head of the world, which was capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian musulmanos vengaran a fair manner.
It is so badly tempted to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimenes against logica cinematica.
However, the film aim is, in fact, one profondamente human beings.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karadi and Mladi esten even free, and emphasises that the Americans and the French is not really concerned persecuting them, because they are political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, so that you have been at the forefront a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this peoma is a mask of an Asian devil: "gandes brow front, I see sharing the feelings, which is hard bad".
In films as "The Hunting" Party also are demons but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only in the gender of films of war in the Balkans.
It recently issued in a newspaper that all films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
We can also add that has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star pokes by a region of crisis or the fields of mines, then appears something like "Rangoon have recently" Arguette Patricia, "across all frontiers with Angelina Jolie or" sangrientes Diamantes "DiCaprio Leonardo.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They must at least move decades until Hollywood ruede a good film about the Holocaust taking such as the film "The list of Schindler".
Some films need longer The classic as works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Now-type NOW" or "Full Jackett" Metal in his time were not held by unanimity as masterpieces.
Today know perhaps too much on global conflicts, and therefore in our times each slaughter (Massenmord) comes submitted directly in two television at home.
That is because the authors of indent are not the slightest objection (which is necessary for power) tell good stories.
"Being or not be" or "great dictator" were ultimately so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin yet knew that bad was in fact the Nazi regime.
Perhaps should not be a good man for rolling a film.
Perhaps needs to be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its distant and sarcastic eye of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between its historical novel "Lemprière" Encyclopaedia and the war in the Balkans, answered: "I only that some things change never".
The major cities always will be in danger, men always going to be killed in Yugoslavia and cruelly always reign war.
von Beust receives as the negative criticism answer on the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economics by not ask the Summer Olympic Games.
Many people want to continue to fight for competitions in the section of water sports.
But Beust reminder that we must be realistic to assess the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz director of the chamber of commerce in Hamburg, Wednesday stated this resignation as "no good for the economic base".
In the last time any other project in the great city such motivation triggered as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective could not keep the political momentum, at the same level sports".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "relates to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust kept their statements that the ambitions in Hamburg in the organisation of the Summer Olympic Games will not be carried out until at least the 2028 year.
"Hamburg not decides on the request for the Olympic Games, but decides the German Olympic Sports Association," says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
Remitió the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) expected in early December on the application of Munich for the Olympic Games in the winter of 2028.
"This preference means to us that this period of time, until now believed to have until 2028, from the point of view realistic will have no chance".
Nevertheless, this dream ended not forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg sport Federation (HSB) deplores the statements by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not ask the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon leave remove the opportunity, if now plans are ruined," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, the director of HSB.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory the declaration of the head of the Senate did in a reception at the general meeting of the German public Federation of sport colleges (adh).
There von Beust appointed in Hamburg's request for 2015 Universiadas not as a "replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport colleges Hamburg appointed as a candidate of the request.
The Party Fraction German Social Democrat (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) criticised senate that did not seize the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years senate delaying with the development of the Grasbrook small neighbourhood, because this was plans for the Olympic Games or building houses," claimed Carola Veit and Jan Quast members of the Social Democrat German Party (SPD).
While the SPD required always an integrated planning of Olympia Grasbrook small and then the use of built-up houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request for the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed by Leipzig.
They are not the coffers of timber.
Whoever links the terms of timber Sweden and box, about Ikea, but not about Andy Warhol.
Or itself?
Today the coffers of timber produced in Sweden as shadow weighing on the list of works Warhol.
Most of the 1990 s and four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes Andy 1968 Warhol Modern museum of Stockholm Museet made internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes" that the ex-director of the museum Pontus Hulthén gave the museum Museet Modern, are false, and almost a% of the other "Stockholm type ', which are in circulation in the art market international, are also.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic production and patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes" depiction of the coffers of wood, blue red and white, with the same shows that had cartons of dust soap "Brillo".
In accordance with Warhol in the exposure of their works of 1968 in the museum Museet Modern were exposed Brillo-cajas hundreds of cardboard. these did not Warhol (by the expenditure), but were trafficked directly from the factory cardboard "Brillo".
There was works of art, but copies (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968 Warhol allowed produce in Sweden Brillo-cajas wood, but they were not exposed in the museum Modern Museet.
those days Witnesses now speak of almost fifteen boxes, at that time entered the history of art and auction as original "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm" type authorised by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought by over $100 000.
The problem is that then that the famous director of the museum Pontus Hulthén did false statements that 1968 in Sweden was produced and exposed almost a% of the wood boxes Warhol left.
But in reality, 105 boxes was produced in year in 1990 for Hulthén Malmö and the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
In this time Warhol had already died since 3 years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives in the museum, Modern investigated Museet six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three Swedish private property were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First printed and esmerilaron their serried platas and then painted the óleo with the pincel.
On the contrary, the structure of copies of 1990 shows that the paint was implemented with a steamroller without printing the platas directly serried and óleo not talking about paint, but paint acrílica.
"These funds have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes Andy Warhol," says Nittve Lars, the director of the museum Modern Museet and adds that if by the Commission Autentificación "Andy Art Warhol" in New York not will come to any conclusion, the museum Museet Modern clasificará these six boxes as copies / objects of exposure ".
Back in July, the Commission Autentificación formally announced that it accepts these "serious allegations" that it is soap dust boxes.
But since then there all remained absolute silence.
