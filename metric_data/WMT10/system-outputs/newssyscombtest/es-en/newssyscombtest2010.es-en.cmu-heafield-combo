The lack of snow in the mountains of concern to the hotel
Not only the peacekeepers of telesquíes in Krkonoše are concerned about the runways without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why, in Krkonoše can still be free rooms for all winter, including for Christmas Eve and.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The People look offers, checked the prices, but still fear of book with commitment.
And if we call, ask immediately on our opinion, if this Christmas will be snow or mud, " said the information portal. Info Martin.
Those who want to move in a according to their expectations, should not hesitate in reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindlerův Mlýn offer especially weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I believe that will continue, but soon relent and provide shorter stays.
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free for all the dates of winter.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered is free.
That is why we have already prepared some stays at the last moment, " said the director of Ingtours Petr.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
Sold very well the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold to regulate.
This year the interest in the winter is impeded by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to go to the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the avenues remain snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas will dry up, " believes Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five per cent better.
For Christmas Eve and Christmas, we have the latest places free.
The Polish interest increases during the holidays in January and February were also sells well, " reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the New Year's Eve stays are already engaged in the hotel, near the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent of Janské hotel Lázně in Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are approximately sixty per cent of the capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as fall snow, the interest in stays in Krkonoše increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel.
However, at the moment, it seems that the hotel of Krkonoše will the appetite for snow waiting.
On Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there is rain, in the mountains should.
But then again higher temperatures, reported Jiří Jakubský Hradec Králové, hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
US: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of more intelligent man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he took on the most stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text used several times the phrase " as in Iraq ", but do not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement: " a new way forward ".
Three years ago was himself, who criticized Bush's idea to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war and that criticized it as " an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences ".
The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today are not of Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improve, however objectively left his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects to repeat the miracle.
The captains of field again ask you to increase the military contingent, especially the commander - in - chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley Mccristal. He, even though the traditional relations, submitted to the rifles undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
Asked 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but it was nothing better, so that at least misled the general about 10,000 military.
Obtained which Europe promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the whole strategy of Obama seems, begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this process in three years. The entire doctrine of Obama generated more questions than answers offered.
Many doubt that the increase give the same result that the procedure in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organised, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement was not satisfied.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to train the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village. After he will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the confusing, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influence.
Even establish a state that is capable of action, " a minimum target for the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy comes by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to burst.
Only a romantic soul, who know nothing of the reality, can believe that the military sent to war to soon return home, " will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, to set the date of the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, since the Taliban will consider this indirectly as a statement of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what relationship has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to take a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America starts the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential election and that is why there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year bonuses in cash.
The entity announced to react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, actions that will not be sold at a minimum period of five years.
Moreover, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that they had assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the power in the long term.
I suppose that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest journey that must, mentioned the former bank investor of the entity Douglas Elliott.
The devil is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having almost $17 billion (almost 300 million CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters news agency, probably exceeds, despite the measures announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics.
Great Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for that exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.

According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
On the citation reported the spokesman for the President.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163.000 million kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because covertly increase the budget deficit.
Among the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, are beginning to be controversial future activities of the cabinet bureaucratic Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, Čssd and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto the package of measures, imposed in the autumn by the government of Fischer to curb the public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long been neglected " serious problem ", i. e. the " sustainable deficit " of public finances.
According to him today no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government that can support a broader consensus between the political parties, could improve this situation, the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The vice - president of ODS, Petr Nečas, said that for the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of Čssd, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.

On Wednesday said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The popular also were happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: invincible, tells a lot about the country, their fight and their victories, although some critics say that the roles the play American players.
The history of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in its biography by the American actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him in the film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said to him: " When I read, I will have to have access to you.
The actor and two years, which received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing milion dollar baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, the fictional president of the US, and even God Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their efforts to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years, became president of the country.

The South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela to cinemas.
He had another goal to play this role in such a way that is as similar as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to talk as he.
The actor said that if he and the world political forces in the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that the apretarle hand, get their energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the world of rugby.
He was A great surprise to, when finally met for the first time in their home.
I remember having called the door, he opened and the first thing that I said to François Pienaar in my life was: " in the film much higher. "
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the players and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: invincible received positive reviews and it also talks of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: " It was a very good story, a film very well done. "
In the reviews of films on the website rottentomatoes. com, Invictus received a 76 per cent of positive assessments.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did evidence of a missile
On Norway observed a special of unknown origin.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia ended recognizing yesterday that near the borders with Norway was evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, " Bulava ", previously designed to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, was not flying or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers write of " Bulavá " and " a missile that not fly. "
A missile that not fly, but shone.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem.
At the end of the flight of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke in the third stage of the missile.
This time " Bulavá " was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile launched from a boat that is moving and black at the same time.
It is therefore likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object in reality outside the failed " Bulavá. "
The Norwegians like from the first moment did not hesitate with a Russian missile.
The generals are saying that this time cannot be simply talk of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without mistakes, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the 13 were unsuccessful.
The success of almost a 50 per cent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that " Bulavá " one day fly without problems and that even will take up to ten blocks hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the trade unions. all the extra work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, unions said on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr, the spokesman of the factory of automoviles Hyundai.
The direction, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a Saturday.
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan, it is essential that proposed voluntary extra work for the Saturday, 19 December is to say, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the Sedmička. cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK employees to work the time on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or can take a free day on 28 December, prolonging a day, Christmas, mentioned Vaněk.
Moreover, all employees of the shifts on Saturday will receive money for travel and for food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and challenging of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped the production last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided to cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned.
The employees of the cars were forced to work two hours more besides shifts of eight hours and this situation virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions cancel the emergence of strike.
Another negotiation between the direction of the factory and trade unionists must be on Monday morning.
The head of the trade unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they commit to meet the requirements and the document was signed, are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.

A Czech discovery: a substance effective until in encallecidos ' HIV virus
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans evidence of new compounds capable of holding the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance improved is the fact that it is also effective against the virus resistant to medicines.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs accessible.
The disease AIDS can be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not removed completely, will create the so - called resistant virus; against them, no longer work medicines.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the ability to dominate the resistance of the virus.
Showed that substances called metalocarboranos have effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In its work scientists find new, ' improved ' compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albumin of the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a three - dimensional structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resilient virus
The proteasis HIV is one of the HIV virus, and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious corpúsculos of the virus.
If we stop the proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explained in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and biochemistry in the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see the table) are united by a short series organic, which continues to be amended systematically.
A little weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the effect of this series of substances against the proteasis HIV was conducted in tube, and also against their variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the metalocarboranos in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the medicines used, however do not lose their effect in the resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes to the metalocarboranos are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the laboratory of Biology in the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of the genetica in the Academía of science.
Heat for budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is " appalling " and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that it is time for analysis.
The vice - president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of Čssd, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if you want to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and the social democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals by the left, by more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of ODS, since cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote left the room and the desire of the government, that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and sense of futility; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals modificadoras, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
Noted that, is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to the government have nothing to do the nominated by the Čssd, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister also should say clearly, if resign, if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: the ministers nominated by the ODS are not responsible
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed Topolánek in the news of the US.
Recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that Fischer decides to reconcile the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit in the public finances, " it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left - wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies. "
But it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by members of ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS yielded at the request of the prime minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies is likely to vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister did not explicitly calls upon the members of ODS to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not as orphans, are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned by the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I realized that my vote.
To leave the mandate knew that, in the following months they were especially bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive, reacted Topolánek.

The links to long distances to the capital will end in Prague station Hlavní nádraží.
Čd will introduce more links between Prague and Ostrava and trains Šumperk/Jeseník move every two hours.
As of 13 December travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account by the regional rail this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so - called losses demonstrable Dráhy will receive next year four billion kroner in total, like this year. local trains are responsible for the regions, next year will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast trains and local dráhy have a new contract for ten years, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why did not increase the price of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will occur only in tickets a day - Čd net and cheap tickets of Internet eliška.
For travellers without customer card the price Čd net increase of 450 SEK 600 SEK.
The price of eliška depend on the distance, until now the single price of 160 kroner to travel between any two regional cities.

Morgan Freeman however says, that is proud of the film.
For many years dreamed of the role and I was prepared to play.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as they say - charge their energy, said in an interview after the festive debut in Los Angeles.
I think it is good, whether through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, perose refers to the whole world, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated into the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game was born the nation. Portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also puts the national dress of the South African team of rugby and RSA won at the time the World Cup.
By entering the gramilla in the clothes, that RSA is seen as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won large, especially of the public white and the recognition of the white people.
The football championship will perhaps help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only " black " in the national team in 1995.

Jančura submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes of Čssd
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes socialdemocráticos.
They are in the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and hetmán of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned this in 20 minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, to maintain the regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing long - term contracts to the České dráhy.
All three hetmánes are attacking us and talk about the fact that we are " taking the of the cake ", however brought only the supply for what they wanted.
Say, which are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the price of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have something else to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
At the same time have the evidence of all the regions. According to him have not taken steps in harmony with European law.
Why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Consider this complaint by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Jančura, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and my region and appeal to other hetmánes do also.
I suppose, that on this occasion it will demonstrate clearly that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false, mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
To Radiožurnál said, that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
Stated, that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions were agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the allocation of approximately 150 billion crowns not called a building.
According to similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of Čssd, because of his criticism of transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we leave, we will lose the licences of buses.
Was presented as a member of Čssd, I know, what it is, I am not going to say its name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time.
However, that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumococos.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January will receive a free vaccine neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, they have to cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age of the child.
Last year the fourth part of the families left voluntarily to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents however paid by a dose 1600 crowns and more.
Smaller To vaccinate children four doses are needed.
Experts estimate that insurance companies will spend in vaccines from 300 to 450 000 SEK annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent across the vaccination of children around 500 000 annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so - called package of Janota.
The neumococo is the cause of otitis media, but also of the serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of Neumococales infections in our country each year according to the research in the hospitals 28 children over the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic cover neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be compulsory in future.
From January should be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The vaccine would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their partnership spreads vaccines neumococales already long ago.
The experts in an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntary.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to undertake, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health but does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes, that the voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks.
If all children receive the vaccine, they will think about the reduction of the number of doses. " in the situation, when the vaccine costs a high amount, relatively understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as a volunteer, " says Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year, more than 80 percent of young parents leaves vaccinate against their babies.
The vaccine neumococal is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save in the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
However the pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members however were afraid, that insurance companies could " get the money of health insurance. "
The Doctors will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have been asked to ban the construction of minarets and that there is a general warning about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which in fact are integrating) in one of the most openly societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the last work of the author " what the French do not like the veils " (" why the French don't like Headcarves ") (2006) , a study elegant and argued a problem which divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As anthropologist, wants to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
Has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen called " Islamic spaces.
He is a good listener that reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that concern them more.
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or in a city (or both) ?
Should teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non - Muslim man?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim uses a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
Are These seemingly mundane issues, argues, things of daily life, which concern the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and scholarly Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
Fail to disseminate this argument.
The Conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Question to what extent the policymakers French (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends the secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims have probably more unfair treatment that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments with the secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived " an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say " Yes, but not yet. "
The most devastating of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat on the planet.
Defining the ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking the life that cannot survive in any other way.
The interests of the oil, gas, transport and fisheries have focused on waters recently open, with diplomats, lawyers and now, as a result of this.
In " on thin ice " (" on thin ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value to the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson as a courageous cadets in 14 years, fighting only with the end of his, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, captured while following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the places of zoos are still generally a part of the area of the scope of an adult savage. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green with algae that grow within the areas without mincing his stripe.

Ellis uses stories of other writers and historians, and often returned to the threat that hunters presented to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in motonieves use high - powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two nations where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, " after the ice " (" the ice ") , Alun Anderson, a former editor of new Scientist, offers a clear and chilling tale about the science of the Arctic and a daunting look how can transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists and oceanographers can adequately explained the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century gave evidence for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the Cold War drew a map of the movedizos belts of ice below the masses of ice.
The satellite and the extensive series of probes fitted into the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr Anderson look inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the system tributary within the Arctic ice, formed by chorritos of saline water that while freezing.
But since the bear in the area until the wonders of the Interior, are all condemned once the summer ice withdrawal, which it believes can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us
Marines among the six that placed wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. Robinson, aged 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N. C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who were standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like someone to do the same for me, so just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met Saturday morning for placing wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the company Worcester in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, and his wife Karen make the journey every year in different cities along the way, to perform events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non - profit organization, wreaths across America, which has spread to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 kroner in the graves of the cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery national Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, said.
It is like visiting a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the fields and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of the First World War, the second World War and the Vietnam war, because they are not as many visits as the new graves, the organisers said.
The atmosphere was joyful while children were playing and the couples were taken in hand, while carrying the fresh pine to the stones sepulcrales.
Every move was a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who are enjugaban tears in their eyes in front of the grave of her son.
Handled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of the marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
" long after my death I want anyone can remember. "
Cuban officials arrested a contractor of the US government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government to mobile and portable computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the State Department.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the Agency for International Development in the United States and the World Bank.
The Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed " dangerous ".
All the so - called counter - revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critics, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a rapprochement " slow pace " to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
The mobile and laptop computers are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and in a country where the average salary of a worker of the government is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used primarily for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and hotel for foreign visitors, and establishment of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
The Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Glory, press officer in the US Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as mobile free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program for Human Rights Watch, which recently published a scathing report on the freedoms in Cuba, Castro, Cuba ", a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
Said that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often leads to a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials Desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they expect the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet in search of young radicalized.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious figure insurgent, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks in the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah addressed the men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, the isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest which have become a terrorist haven.
They are considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when Pakistani police authorities arrested.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, emphasizes the critical role of the recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has as top priority try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization acting as guards, not leaving those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to the applicant American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to its potential to have access to American objectives and due to its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the Foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? said.
It has been transformed into a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, require " action " climate
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here through the streets demanding the negotiators who work in the Convention centre beautiful center of the city, bolder actions to the climate.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day in which just happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists walked through the city in English holding banners that said " there is a planet B " and a Spanish, which stating, " the Earth says ' enough is enough '.
Several celebrities joined the protest, even the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the homeland of his mother, made me aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding, said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way of avoiding more time.
The police prevented the demonstrators from approaching the beautiful center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or carrying of pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified by being involved in the climate talks, some activists with masks and black dresses placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
Were the buildings, he said, adding that began as, but which were followed by " a couple of big explosions. "
Inside the Convention center, people gathered around television screens to look the way throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not penetrate the awareness of key officials as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on the climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact on international deliberations, replied in English, " was not really aware of the situation ".
Then followed saying in Mandarin, " as the meeting place is great, I can hear what is happening outside. "
Noted that depended on the prospect of each define if progress was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, " it can also be said that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools in the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth grade strides at a more rapid pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between students African - American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in fourth grade of D. C. during the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) , but their peers African - Americans rose only three points, 209 to 212.
In fact the difference in performance grew between 2007 and 2009, 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African - Americans from the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant, 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap between black and white students in fourth grade in 2003, when it released the first Enpe in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202) .
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the District expressed concern last week, since progress by the Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) , were driven in large part by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non - profit organization that advocates the educational equity in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy by a difference of two or three points, said the D. C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem. - por accumulation) , who has a daughter in the fourth degree of Eaton elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that the secondary schools in the city have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not the time nor the energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to find better ways to address the needs of the students.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, targeting students in the higher grades of primary and lower secondary school, which dominated the fundamentals of reading in their school and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real - life experiences, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which is something of the progress reported by the Enpe last week.
But I think that we need to continue working to offer the best speeches to those students who are below the level of degree, said.
Others say that the results of the Enpe highlight the issue of whether Rhee can further increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low - performing schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of rocky dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, scores of evidence urban.
The solution of the conventional policy is to devote their resources and reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D. C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that go against that timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other cities, she is clinging to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access to an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to the difference in performance is the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with independent schools.
To reach nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the Union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as an " indicator " to seek a greater increase in the next Convention.
To make higher education a more future
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a moment before the white columns, the facades of brick and the meadows.
The parents of Graciela barely had graduated in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and the other pupils of eighth grade of the group explored Gettysburg, where registration costs 38.690 dollars a year, their attitude was less of guests impressed that the potential of enthusiastic students.
Yes! here is where I am! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
Goodness, seriously? , he said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited during his three - day trip, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: the question is not whether you go to university.
The question is what.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants leave secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands that access to university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanics " second generation " at the University, a remarkable achievement given that many of their parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the labour force of the country.
Those who analysed the higher yield say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes can also play a role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Noting to low - income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied to students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour by the universities of is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement the programmes of preparation, which start when low - income students are in middle school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, during two auctions which ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are having pujado in only two of the 10 sites.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American, Asian and European companies to the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of online news.
It will be a long time before that something more is on offer in Iraq.
The safety concerns, marked by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while the American military are withdrawn, probably prevented the American oil companies risk more forcefully in Iraq, which is the third most important reserve of crude oil in the world, said analysts.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have significantly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they are accountable to the shareholders.
Exxon - Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, empty - handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The National oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, in more contracts than any other company and achieved major investments in contracts for two main fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be on a par with its competitors and will honour its commitments to Iraq.
The companies to submit proposals made offers then with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each field.
The chief planner of Al Qaeda has been apparently killed in Pakistan
It is believed that a US missile strike in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a principal planner of Al Qaeda operations this week, said Friday the US counter - terrorism officials.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh was one of the two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American and Pakistani officials sources in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, of the kind operated by the CIA in the tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from watching Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected were rushed to the scene and quickly seized what was left of the " bodies completely wrecked. "
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two American counter - terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a military planner of Al Qaeda, who led the operations outside the region.
Was devoted to conspire around the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guide of the senior command of Al Qaeda and translated into operational standards for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of Al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
May not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat that came to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high - ranking officers.
The pace of attacks by pilotless aircraft guided by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to an account of the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non - profit organization.
The decline is perhaps a tactic improved by terrorist groups, that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly to informants, said the site.
The top UN envoy in Kabul to give
The United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan backed by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that supports the increase, but is concerned that the American timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long - term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, to work with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector needs to be reflected in the civilian sector, said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki - moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two - month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to search for a replacement, according to UN officials.
The officials say they have been considering to Staffan di Mistura, a citizen who recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean - Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused in September of President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was sacked, " certainly undermined the mission, because there was already much scepticism about the international interference " in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a high representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
Also the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff in the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, claiming that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of the UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
So it is that the rules of the UN allowed me to recruit only a person since May, said.
That is catastrophic and could not continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that world powers will soon " significant additional sanctions against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he dismissed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that worries me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of targeted sanctions on Iran's military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to " a package of incentives and disincentives ", " to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons ", because " its people will suffer greatly " sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences " credible " if its nuclear programme is not fully respects the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that it would negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would make a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for this agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided with regard to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options, including continuing with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called " devastating sanctions. "
In a statement issued in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what he called the " unfounded and baseless accusations of ", on the part of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, " in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, was found in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq's oil wealth, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions are high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in projects in the United States, to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. American officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the regional government of Kurdistan: " their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them. "
In a China that ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda that the sermoneaban on the fact that " the mother earth is too tired to sustain more children " and " a baby means a grave more. "
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of their city, changed tack suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, his reaction was instant and firm: in any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with a child of 8 months.
More than 30 years after that one child policy being introduced in China, creating two generations of children notoriously rechonchos, children alone, apodados " little emperors ", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with the six when the policy was effective, according to the division
Demographic of the UN, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 and above exploit the 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with populations, as Shanghai.
Last year, the people of 60 years and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the family planning Commission and Shanghai municipal population, has said that the fertile couples must have babies to " help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate future labour shortages. "
Shanghai is about to be " as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden, " he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the one - child policy is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoid a critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights activists have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples have abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high proportion.
In recent years, the demographic officials have gradually softened its position on the one child policy.
In 2004, allowing more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are children only, and in 2007, many of its hard - line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the institute of Population research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government officials have been discussing recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, Shanghai became the first city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, posters ordering to the families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be best to have a second child and apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slipping leaflets under doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although the officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that noted a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said he would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But as many Chinese, have only medical and life insurance that provides them with the government.
Without a network of social protection, they argue, this option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly the policy of only son as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: " we were at the centre of our family and we were accustomed to all of us.
We are not used to care for others and we do not really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two careers, middle class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew up watching the fight of their parents during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves, said.
Even a single child requires long of parents, argued.
A mother has to give at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, " have to reshape their apartment, and the strategic " must have a curriculum prepared for the best care when the child is 9 months. "
Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, marked so far by challenging positions and mutual recrimination, a renewed focus on Friday with the release of a document which provides ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders come to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money the rich to poor countries to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a range of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies recortarían its production of coal, and what would be the limit of the global rise in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the document of six pages, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as " the big picture. "
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations recortarían collectively their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries recortarían emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday was presented the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The US special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the assertions that call for mandatory cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, compared with the volunteers from the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the major developing countries to move forward and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, said that the maximum climate negotiator lacked " common sense, " or was " very irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic history of the world's major powers at stake, the fault lines have eruption both within the developing world, as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies to save the planet, with China and the United States face on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the 24 most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take more courageous.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even when the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will be at best a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a preliminary draft Treaty of 24 pages early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge - Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has " political pressure on the political process, " in part because they are now consolidated and demand action from the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government to close a deal.
The high - level officials, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister, fell from the aircraft and ran into the corridors of the beautiful center, closed meetings and press conferences, in order to define the claims that during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people entering and leaving the Convention centre, the activists concerning the guitar performances night to flout the countries which they are selling, and are preliminary proposals of hand instead of mail) , poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice - president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh of Great Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
To 5.13 on Monday morning, a perforará darkness to point a way out of train that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high - speed intercity train the country will reach 225 kmh, when as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of transportation, is joining the lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first intercity service Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service linking Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connecting the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the times of business travel would be shortened and the change of planes and cars to rail would reduce domestic emissions of coal, as well as the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can curb the high - speed lines in Britain.
High Speed Two (Hs2) , a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, presented its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the times.
This will provide a detailed itinerary of the next phase planned for the high - speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive map.
Hs2 is also expected to establish three options for a high - speed network broader approach to the North.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favoured option is being proposed is a configuration with, and in which a single high - speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line was split in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the West from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the north - east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
" It seems that this option would be more beneficial, " said a member of the railways.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which is not before 2025, would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, making the British network in Europe more quickly.
The initial route is designed to withstand trains 400 Mt of length, capable of carrying people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of.
This means that the London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions of area of the capital, is expected to extend an existing station to conform to the high - speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International station or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is implemented, the network would have to be built in sections.
The principle would make the trains to stop the rapid the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point needed to secure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage by £Naranjal 75,000 of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Naranjal built in the home of his constituency.
The spokesman of prisons in the party, which was damaged by David Cameron to complain that members lived rations ", increased their mortgage in £75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.
Allowed him to burden the taxpayer interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of the expenses of members. Last night Mr Duncan said that the " could not be clearer or more simple. "
Mr Duncan, one of the members of Parliament, has a two - storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year added a greenhouse to the home, described as a " Naranjal levels ".
The Neighbors described it as " a greenhouse for entertainment ".
He was not asked Mr Duncan to make any reference to the increase of the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on standards and privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the Committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of their expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds of their London property to his constituency home, which he bought in 1991, the previous year to become a member.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was asking about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £800 per month.
The interest rate on the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland by Mr Duncan not changed in that time, suggesting that the increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the rate that is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan was asking £1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as chairman of the opposition in the House in September, after a reporter covert filmed saying that members had to survive " on rations " after the expenses scandal.
" basically this is being nationalised, you have to live on rations and be treated as m GDR. "
Said: " spending my money in my garden and I ask a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And could ask for much more, but I am not. "
The Member, a millionaire by his former profession as oil trader, was questioned in the first place on their spending in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the office of wages that this " could be considered excessive ".
An activist dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the pound sterling in the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest, after revealing that requested £4,000 over three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase of the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: " was for improvements, approved by both the office of wages and subsequently by Legg. "
He added: " It is not to evade and commit crimes or infrinjir the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be any clearer or more simple. "

Moreover, an alternative religious group that encourages the spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using as its theme.

Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing of TV of Hove, is a cleric of the leader of the diocese of Chichester and beyond.
He said: " We want that religion is more relevant to the people, in a society of post Christianity. "
" Why we expect as a church that people come to an old building strange? I believe that the Church should come to the people and hold in exciting ways.
" The idea of the timetable of the advent of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends at a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant and we are trying to try and represent that through the spirituality. "

The prison guards unions called on Friday to a " general mobilisation " to demand payment before the end of year festivities, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until eneropor budgetary reasons.

The direction of the prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot - Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards by guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the direction of the prison administration immediately implement a set of measures designed to this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime not reoccur in the future.
The pay of December will then be little, except for the staff of the direction that enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that " always blames budgetary constraints, " deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the Union interregional FO in Marseilles, announcing his decision to boycott until further notice " all meetings and ".
The staff will not to work on Sundays and holidays relevant if the month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône - alpes - auvergne.

According to the trade unions, not in all regions is the same, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not expected, said the Secretary - General of the Ufap, Jean - François forget.

The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié - salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer accused of violent way Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November in the private international Monceau Park, in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, declared Camus.
There is talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean - Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had " gone too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the surgeon. "

Without doubt, return to the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I think it is very risky, declared Camus.
The association UDF lifts the tone and warns the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy) , controlled by the modem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday before the attempt by the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (takeover bid) on the acronym of the former party giscardista, intimándole to withdraw all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to regain the acronym UDF, because it considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend its political legacy after he reached out to the left.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister, whose party is linked to the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As support for its management, received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current) who claims ownership of the brand, it was the first registered in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it broke the silence to launch a call to the Minister and to the Member intimándolos to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the mark, on pain of legal action.
These last few days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose to his political movement to restore the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the modem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the centrist alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the Nouveau centre + +, and the slogan + + in its militant material and on the home page of its website, argue the signatories of the Charter.
As we know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the office of the UDF that requires the " immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as well as of (his) Internet site ".
Also requests Hervé de Charette " to transfer ownership of (the) marks to the legitimate copyright ".
To do so, to use the court to uphold the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF " is a real political movement since 1978 " and remember that Morin and his friends " chose " leave in 2007 " to create a new party, as had already been done in 2002 to create the UMP ".
Therefore, the new centre, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending " the material and moral interests of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, " when registered the trademark ", it was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, " but of the UMP.
Advantage of scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do on their own.
This indiscretion is transformed into crime, reported, before mockery of the strategy of the NC: " We believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy made his own name to try to get out of anonymity fraudulently taking a name that is not right. "

More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing: it is that the partners to join " values " from above as before it was imposing on the consumer products designed for the technical factory.
To put the customer in the heart of the company, the revolution of marketing gave to the strategies of the conquest of markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the factors of preference for customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilisation of employees can end in a deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly executives.
This demobilization serious commits the intellectual development of all the functions of the company, especially of the R& D and, even more, of the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the (business intelligence) demands that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive behaviour and a forward - looking vision "; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we convened a managerial revolution, which would be the partners in the centre of the concerns of the company as the customer.
Opinion polls have a relative utility
Do domestic opinion polls, as the questionnaire by Orange among their employees, will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, fear not.
- In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially ... what always! B989
- secondly, because the authoritarianism, one of the conditions of power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- finally, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As from large schools of engineers, interpret the psychology mechanistically.
Take, for convenience, the former behavioral theory that the " American " recently, and that the institutes of studies and the media were largely behind their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the " commandos " (sic) of the commitment of the executive, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. fr reaffirms to the managers in a position of management, unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into all reasoning or practice of business management, a basic fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly as a means to realize their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the analysis Motifuncional take this concept of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge his company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the factors of mobilization, managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate its " social performance " and derecursos human " in the place ".
In this way, create a favourable ground for the development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: " just war " Obama receives praise of the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had said on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for the vice - presidency for the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, principal of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had raised the issue of the war " sometimes necessary " in his recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, the war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, observed.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain their decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done " a very good job " in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, the former president of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the mention of " the existence of evil in the world " in the words of presidential.
At times, the speech I felt very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program " The Takeaway ".
The former elected representative, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential elections in 2012, was pleased to hear " a president of the left " when reminded the members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free or could deliver a prize for peace if the use of force not exist ".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered a very American " speech ".
In addition to stand as " citizen of the world ", as it always does, " " spoke as an American President " to remind the Europeans " living in a security bubble that they did not create and do much to preserve it, " Gerson said.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech " monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration " on the Web site of National Review Online.
To the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocents, warned.
However, the press centre left praised the president.
Los Angeles time, though still believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech " overproduction " especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo " should serve as a road map to guide the international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression, " commented excited the Californian newspaper.
Obama delivered the speech that was necessary, " the New York Times, judged " at the time of bleak and
Road Transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations, the health sector unions of roads and the TLF (transport and logistics of France) , the only organisation employers who stayed until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
During the session of signatures on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was " delighted " with the agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators farewell at the dawn of the Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even when three organisations (Fntr, Unostra, Otre) retired by the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 H was necessary for all agree and the text is firm to 18 h.
The conflict " has been very damaging for business " and " it was feared that disturbs the end of year holidays, " Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in the local and regional road transport) , and 2.9% for the highest (transport) .
The rate per hour rises of 8.72 euros to 9,06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO) .
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some rebellious, added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that it is " a good agreement ", although it was " difficult to grant increases to higher wages taking into account the international competition ".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) is recognized as a " historic agreement ".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of an extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau said that " a low of EUR 100 million on employers ' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the finance bill of correction for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote " under the same terms.
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement is implemented, firstly, to businesses in this organisation and, secondly, the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of an extension.
It will be " as soon as possible, " assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers ' organisations could only delay the process.
The Fntr complained that it was a " business of naive ", as the EUR 100 million " had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to frustrate those who want to eat Turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner, regretted the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk " the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.
RER: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagreed with the proposals of the
The conflicts in the RER, the largest urban public transport in France, they are going to continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to its request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only move trains between 10 p. m. and 20 H, at the rate of one every two in the central section (train between the defense and nation) and a train out of four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the Snfc will be suspended in Nanterre, which will force passengers to change.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy " the RATP strive to provide service to the large stores ".
The RER crosses from West to east, the city of Paris.
The RATP from Saint - Germain - en - Laye and Nanterre to Boissy - saint - léger and Marne - la - vallée.
This Friday, roughly one in two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost no train in hours Valley, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the terraced thanks to the organisation of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint - Germain - en - Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy - saint - léger (Val - de - Marne) , Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained that " an hour and a half to reach hours.
The station was not, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER to the SNCF operates from Cergy - le - haut or into arrived or departed from the station Saint - Lazare to join the meters.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. the results will be analysed, " unsatisfactory " according to the trade unions, a meeting held with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The director of the proposed to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who demand a premium that they must, according to Thierry Garon (SUD) .
The RATP puts even between parentheses its premium, commented outraged the CGT, pointing out that the direction " was not able to resolve a problem that the SNCF and the roads had already resolved ".
A new meeting is expected on Monday to " a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession, the RATP.
What also led to the trade unions to say that the company " does not cared for users of the weekend ".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters, in Paris.
Then the direction, which refused until then to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting " to calm the waters ".
The conflict could spread to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and indépendants have filed a notice.
The unions are calling for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers daily.
The drivers of RER, all in the second degree of his career, charge of EUR 2.7 gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolving the party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the main party in the country, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south - east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which has just lend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity declared to the press by the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, but a majority of seven votes was needed to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Member Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the assets of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550) .
Their leaders warned before the verdict that members of Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision comes in the wake of a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of obeying the " principles " of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) , considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and by many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party claims it has no " organic links " with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and called on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time that the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south - east Anatolian, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the leader of the PKK, Abdullah degenerated into clashes with the police over the last few weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the main city of in south - east populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces of order threw tear - gas grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators throwing Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, also focused around 100 people.
After the verdict, said that the decision of justice going to " deepen the despondency ".
Turkey can resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) dissolving a party, told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said the energy Minister.
This decision boycotted the opening of democratic launched by the government, said the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most bloody in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to the Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for the secret investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the " Silicon Valley ".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the seat of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the innovation Centre of Frankfurt (FIZ) .
There were various mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a " Protocol of close collaboration. "
The Vice - alcalde Juri Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services.
In the 2010 travel to a seminar in Selenogrado representatives of FIZ and managers of small and medium - sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences.
Scientific exchange
It is a scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The companies will have the chance to put a foot in the Russian market.
To change the Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes.
They include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so - called " city of socialist " for research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as " green city ") received its name from the landscape of mountains, in which settled research facilities.

The size of Stuttgart 21 places for nothing is sufficiently high.
For supporters of the project is simply as " the new heart of Europe ".
The law on. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the capital of the region of Banden - württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
With terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time fossils of engineering of the 19th century, acting as brakes of a modern rail traffic, formerly an enormous amount of time was needed for locomotives back ahead.
Rolling, stopped in their tracks continue the journey; but it should be done.
And why should disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step, which is approximately half of the journey of the trans - European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of " heart of Europe ".
The S21 really will be initiated, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the capital hessiana and Bavarian is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
The Rail terminals of course also have more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with unity tractora and cart driver at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built ice towards Ulm already will be initiated.
The Federal politicians and communal have prepared well.
The rail continues, also because the risks of large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic is the taxpayer and not the state.
From the point of view, the project still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, many green areas, probably of generated by computer the designer.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The station and the road are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time was not given the competition from low - cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening the transport of goods, since the rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than those made by lorries on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zuavos.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic to between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
In total 60 bigger projects are in the list of the Ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of rails long through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route at a slow pace.
Be urgent here the accelerator pedal.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the autonomous parliament in Wiesbaden, if you are going to make an appeal to the decision on the prohibition of night flights of the Administrative court of Hesse.
The coalition of CDU/FDP appears to have commissioned experts in the legal research of the judgment of the Vgh, of more than 400 pages, as the Minister of economy, Dieter Posch (FDP) .
The administrative court in Kassel had founded in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway north - west planned at the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged in the federal government, would not be compatible with the obligatory legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is going to present the appeal against the decision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the government representatives to reject the appeal before the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer - gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to honour their promises of prohibition of night air traffic, made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of floor.
It is quite difficult, if you let him keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP " we keep our word. "
The Minister rejected the recrimination of Schäfer - gümbel, that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentation of the right and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition would not act on the basis of a " quick first impression.
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
As well as the opposition, not have never been the tenets of their group on the prohibition of night air traffic.
The US banks back aid provided.
The big American banks buffeted by the crisis are stripped of their state.
The " Bank of America " returned at once the aid that he had paid the bank rescue fund Tarp of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion) .
And also the group plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the United States.
With this the institutes are free from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
The " Bank of America " had secured about 19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had few resources, including the sale of items.
The banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked the Wednesday night especially to American taxpayers: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the takeover of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The group Citi also aims to get money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported source of circles, the American bank could announce already for this Thursday increased its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the group did not want to comment.
In June had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Election
In the end, it was faster than was thought.
Barely two weeks after the administrative council of the German television channel ZDF (pressing editor - in - chief of Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely also influenced the further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal is not adopted in the administrative board.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The result of the vote was not yet finalised the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renew the contract for another five years of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against it. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure to Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
For the majority of the Union in the administrative Council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support in his post.
The opposition against the editor - in - chief of had been organized by the President of the government of Hesse, Roland Koch.
Declined another mandate of the editor - in - chief of prestigious with the argument, which under the leadership of Brender news ZDF have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections, there were protests due to this, in which flageló political influence on the ZDF.
In the end until had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which described the act as unconstitutional.
But did not.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
Studied politics, education and romance.
Later worked in the station " Südwestfunk " and " Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper. "
In 1983 was changed for the ZDF, in principle the informative " heute - journal. "
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 rapporteur editor - in - chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the Morgenmagazins; until 2001, director of the foreign policy of the; since then director of the study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint then the dismissal of Brender, which was elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the magazine of media ".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the President of the government of Rhineland - Palatinate, explained last week that the Federated States should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the proposals of the director can be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the bodies of the ZDF was removed by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr Peter Frey, recommended to the administrative Council with a smart move: criticised heavily by the dismissal of Brender guild.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence so could Schächter name for the post of head of wording without losing face, as the administrative Council could vote, without falling under suspicion to post a henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allocated to the liberal left.
The university careers are
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and culture of the Federated States finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions in the cases of bachelors and masters.
Students should in future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the race must end with a single examination.
In addition to examine the workload of students, and it wants to ensure a " real and justifiable ".
The policy and the universities want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated States commit themselves to draw more flexible rules structural together to careers of bachelor and master.
Regulations of the federal states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the ministers of education and culture and the rectors of universities talk constantly of the improvement of power and conclude with a successful career (estudiabilidad) .
Now for the first time there was talk of a content.
The so - called accreditation Council agreed to drastically reduce the number of tests: " Each module ends with a single review, " says in a document of 30 pages, which seeks to regulate the approval of the academic careers.
With the significant reduction of the burden of examinations " is intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the estudiabilidad, explained the director of the accreditation Council, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future, " estudiabilidad " must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined in detail in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of ..
The courses.
The Students would have " the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage the own initiative ".
These rules resort for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be " reacreditar once every five years. But this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation Council, which was installed by the Länder.
The ministers of education and culture called the federated States in October influence on the agencies, in such a way that the amount of raw and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools already agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now only Renania - platinada assured provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring programs and student advice, as well as strengthen and foreign offices.
The land and the universities seek to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to Parliament a novel of the university law.
As it should be enough just one examination for the completion of a model of career.
The shape of the race should be made more flexible, it also wants to ensure the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to master.
Until the end of next year is intended to examine all the careers about their " estudiabilidad ".
This Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of the land.
Part of the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
In the board at the federal level of the university groups Juso (Young Socialists) seexigía, that the shape of the education policy is no longer should be " behind closed doors " of the ministers and the university rectors.
At the latest after the strikes of education, now students as main involved should be able to say.
The President of the board of university rectors (HRK) , Margret Wintermantel, gave their support to students: " We need the experience of the students, " said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers for Education, with which the HRK deliberated on a joint document on reform.
For the Union of education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demands a legal right for each student with the title of the possibility of access to a masters degree.
Federated States also have to ensure that the current generation of students of bachelor exist in a future enough seats for master with the best possible conditions of study. It reported a member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The federal States have quecontratar significantly more teachers.
But about greater access to the Masters, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
" enter and exit from Germany is virtually no control, " says the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner in fragments of language, in which tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany by a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as reader in a publisher of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To Söllner gave him several prizes for literature, in 1993 the memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt the Goethe University, and since el2002 is director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on " German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured their dossiers "
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service against fellow writers alemanes - rumanos, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
The Attempts of recruitment had started slowly, early in 1971.
" Therefore I am someone who is not sufficiently defended in the face of attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate ", ended Söllner.
The lyric is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and his controversial literary unparalleled with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, shaking the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors of Romania for a case that highlighted the divisions and the evil of a political system, which is based in control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is what we know so far, is not only author, but also a victim.
In his dossier of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist literary Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner, and stressed the positive influence for him delim Walter.
He had apologised or defended in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
" I feel the need to do this, " he said.
The declaration of Söllner in this way and in the face of this was unexpected, the confession of a ex - disidente and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securitate - spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in the month of July in the weekly " Zeit ", having read its own dossier of 914 pages.
Those involved probably will have speculated and known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, and also of Walter.
Unlike the review of the files Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the issues of control by the Securitate is still quite unclear.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS) , corresponding to the authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is more.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the condecorada.
" She is psychosis, " in the end only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions inevitably arise with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame silent.
Why right now? who is caused damage? The calm reaction of the listeners in the face of the confession of Söllner leaves hope that the continuation of this history is governed by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, addressed a taxi Mercedes class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the foreign service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very nice celebration of Christmas, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man in the feature had hired a driver, because they still do not know the city.
Moreover, it would also have been able to drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was joy man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: " It is true that we reached the final of ", namely in the Champions League, thanks to 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, " but we cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by the success: we will have to fight against the decline. "
The " task much more they expected the next Sunday, said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat the success of the " real " in the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5) , (8) and (11) .

The final of the Champions League (parties to the 16/17 and 23/24 February/parties back 9/10 and 16/17 March) , sortearán on 18 December in Nyon.
So it remained limited the joy at the entrance of Babbel successor.
Not only in the course Salvador, short time they had inspired the bewildered profis of Stuttgart self - confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on its strengths, urged more be launched, explained the of souls gross its recipe for success that sounds simple, but with the therapist Babbel already had ineffective.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, " when in football there is a new impetus, sometimes things that had not been thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after a break of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly to become the best player local thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " wind " and the manner of work of the new head: " He is a man who and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And that is what has been missing, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sport steering
But the VfB Stuttgart on record.
As gross, also the players and the manager refrained from overstate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of relay and totally of the Romanian guests.
Also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had reached the sad, to think Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated in the form of a television interview, sent just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, and not Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
It had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change their coach by the pressure of the fanatics teenagers.
It was Also removed his day off after the games Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were " marked by the pure selfishness ", Heldt, and announced consequences.
No longer will Probably be friends forever, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others in that, without previous efforts with the team of coach replaced, would not have been possible had the spectacle of great strength and battle.
Babbel and their assistants had " an important participation in the success, " said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed the man in the suitcase full of plastic.
Fight the World Cup of heavyweights
Ardent mourning in Berne: time and again the challenging Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight world champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association expired on the evening of Friday to Saturday in Berne the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 119: 109) .
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to make the noqueo that all had hoped.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to give due to injuries.
The Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before a 17000 spectators in the sand of Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, than before the mourning had proclaimed the end of the era, was again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not take decisively to its target dangerous.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenging, and just tried to move the rounds.
While he was taunting with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, which bore full 12 rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, had already been true scandal in the Swiss capital.
Had insulted Klitschko as " horrible zombie ", which " does not know nothing ".
The weight, the champion was left on Friday to take Johnson's glasses sun of the nose " to see their eyes. "
Fourth triumph following the return of Klitschko
Also at its fourth row after their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, expired in the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered " their " belts of the WBC, which previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year fell later in their defences of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained his rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the British belt belongs to David Haye, after he destronó in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company which promotes the fight against Klitschko is planning at the Wembley stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack the opposition: the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called liar the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, due to false information on the subject.
The SPD and the leftist require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence, Karl - Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) , with knowledge of the facts.
In the transmission of news " Tagesschau " on Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister had not told the truth " about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, usually says: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the international force protection for Afghanistan (ISAF) .
This is the essence of the report that had NATO, and read the Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday had been released in this attack was not only to destroy the abducted lorries, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack in the United States, requested by the German commander, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation of NATO, died or were injured to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left called on Saturday in the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to take immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the federal government's policy in Afghanistan, and if the chancellery, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The Ministry did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended misgivings about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the Spiegel, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely against the background of the attack on the convoys.
Had said that they had been Officially denied the existence of the reports of NATO and had concealed details sensitive to the minister.
However, since the environment of the two senior officials, it transpired that they even had pointed to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two - page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a patrol of the area.
Meanwhile, Wichert have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, the newspaper " Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung. "
So far has not received a response, it was said.
The Ministry on Saturday was expressed to the criticisms to make, and suggested that this be clarified in the Federal Parliament's Committee of inquiry, which will be the next Wednesday.
Worlds Oníricos
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are acostados in our rooms dark with our eyes closed, we can without hindrance to the more wild imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, who experience States similar to the dream during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, is considered the most modern in the Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniático.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drugged.
The blame lies our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes are blurring the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness alert modified can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases, call visions, and at worst, madness.
Although it can distinguish the trigger and effects, it can refer to similar processes such visions of the Hildegard von Bingen, experiences psicodélicas of the prophet of the new era Carlos Castañeda, states of possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when it has the balance of the neural substances of communication in the brain - above all, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and acetilcolina - and is the interaction between different parts of the same.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear hallucinations complex thoughts and crazed.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied the philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle approached the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, in 1861 a " great resemblance of the state of madness with the oníricos ', to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was " a psychosis, with all the absurdities, alocadas formations and attractions ".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, deformed, rechinando teeth.
They are pursuing, with heavy boots and flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices shrill and malignant resound from the walls and the radio.
Can no longer bear the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. pulls two cables of the stereo, to form a knot of hanged, and set in a hook on the ceiling.
You climb in a whelk and the noose around the neck.
Salta.
The rope was loose.
What you will serve as a lesson! , the voices in a chorus that the eardrums, " sees the clinic and do you! "
Now, Henning T. is 40 years and has undergone six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of death was the LSD.
His diagnosis is esquizo - afectiva - paranoide psychosis, is also maniaco - depresivo, takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with their disease, three years ago is married.
In the psychosis have experienced the most terrible anguish and despair, said.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics are as the second most common disease after the depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, in the relationship, or disorders.
Particularly widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
They are also frequent the hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, awareness is inundated with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general Psychiatry clinic of Heidelberg University hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time entering a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and not organise actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, the impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, he says, " the spatial and sensory structure of the reality in the psychosis remain in principle. "
The paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown why our brains for mishaps.
According to Fuchs, the states of emergency can lead to any person to lose touch with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that in addition to the genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is in an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system, which manifests itself in all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role - the stress or a traumatic experience can be the trigger psychosis when there is already a provision.
In the same way, the hallucinogenic drugs can lead to psychosis, as they interfere in the system of the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical of all this is that the people are with their hallucinations and take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor in psychology Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
The perceived a hallucination as pleasant or not often hinges on the point of view.
Kasten collects from ten years ago reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the paper die irreale Welt in unserem (the unreal world in our head) , published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of the psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, together with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, also often diseases such as tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and injuries craneoencefálicos.
In a surprising and under specific conditions, the brain healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, is composed of memories that normally are repressed.
Arise when the brain areas that are processed sensory perceptions are hyperactive or are little; when our brains hot, but also when stimuli.
The drugs can cause this state in the same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of brain or other states of emergency.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an mindestens
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and sent to a secondary school.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recess, it happens that a boy clumsy with long hair and dark runs the floor.
When she replied, the other pupils look soprendidos; nobody, a part of it, hear or see the boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a little strange, but Sarah K. knows that it is not dreaming.
Is awake and sees and hears that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting in the Bank.
Can feel even their presence, at least a few moments.
It is a pleasant, like the boy.
Sometimes wonders whether it is mad.
Also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because Professor - their eyes and ears - is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest explains so visible and audible the mathematical equations.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes too late and is low, not know if it is happening or dreaming, the images that we see, the nose or the girl with cuts in arms and legs, appear to their eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, shouts to the figures.
To Their parents and friends told you nothing, that is insane.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. has hoy20 years.
Approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has come in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is emptied yse charged the same sought entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter only, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, learned that the man called Daddy since that use of the reason is not his biological father.
Since the noise and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, as Sarah K. it is difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. " Every experience, " says Kasten, " takes place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, that seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies the night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, healthy people are able to recognise their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation between dream and hallucination
In this world too focused on what is aware, the experiences often generally patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt - degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the hospital's psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic Florence - nightingale - krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful but that also involves something positive and creative - the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt - degenhard has investigated the so - called oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The Oníricas hallucinations are almost dreams very detailed and complex that the person experiences considers real and subsequently cannot differentiate from staying.
The States aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or a disease, as for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a paralysis remain completely aware. die Eibâs.
According to Schmidt - degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or of the world due to a motor disability total and permanent, it replaces a real situation very dangerous by an imaginary world and that is decoupled from reality.
A form of extreme situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own ability allows us not sink into nothing of the loss of awareness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also the historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zurich, described their experiences oníricas in his book Herzenwechsel as of a rescue of the soul.
Had 49 years, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after an operation of the heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the intensive care.
Claussen descended into a world created by the same and visited once strange places: was caved in a bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium in a train, a robot for their health.
Was in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by noble produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike was kidnapped in their country of origin, surfing on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow and found with a Korean Mafia.
What gives these facts on imaginary, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these trips interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips are mental, many years later, much more clear, even in the details irrelevant.
Even More clear and intensive that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience diluted the horizon of the rest of our everyday experience, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt - degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile the internal reproduction of the reality outside, even when we are awake.
Every amendment of the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, " can lead to a distortion of what we call reality. "
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Crude
The children will take charge of the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave their company in the future in the hands of his two sons, told Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert gross sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have committed to joining the company, confirmed gross, 69 years, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are able to do so.
One can put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not sufficiently trained for this.
That would with the children and also with the company.
Gross announced on Thursday that he will retire from January the presidency of the board and that Paul - bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, 52 is since 1999 member of the direction of crude.
In a start was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and with it came the responsibility on the heritage of the company. Following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, the alien, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the apex of the editorial.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to " bridge the gap of 10, 15 years, " according to gross.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Gross said that family businesses are not immune to the decline: " This has always affected families are transmitted by the quest for search for capital, which have misjudged and thought they could be raised as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had " delusions of grandeur, " says gross.
I do not see this as a political coach of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with the " time " in the world League; these businesses have become too big.
The promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the post, without even seeing some kind of Deputy or surf the net.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named one of the products of the year.
See on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free service of data for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday in the event, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is equally limited than its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, of about 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon) to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming to fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated of ears of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming prices for the whole of Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
That a aparatito as Fonpeek (it is curious that bear the name of Fon when lacks Wifi) achieves this kind of charges means that operators are starting to think differently and studying different proposals to data network.
Kindle is another good example, includes the trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and bagpipes.
It is a connected device and paid for it to buy it, month to month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fonpeek, an option to purchase with access for life as Peek already has in US
Not because there will buy it.
I watch my post in the telephone, thank you.
I hope so, because I think that it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The colour fetish of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the tone of the American first lady.
If it came to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a dress and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to follow, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken a model very similar in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar colour - amarillo verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts - dress, jacket and shelter of the same tela -, and adornaba with a large embroidery or.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the question which are the two suits makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
The supplements have also changed: shoes greens on the last time, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
And also different is the hair: a included on this occasion, throwing the previous one.
75% of working mothers has had problems for their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study ' fertility and work history of women in Spain ', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers has seen limited opportunities in the workplace because of motherhood.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence of couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not work and the type of work.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, working part - time, or have a stable work, initiated before the coexistence, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delaying the coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
" women between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time record vital to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the Union and the arrival of the children.
Moreover, the type of work performed exerts great influence on motherhood although less about the timing of the pairing, " explains the researcher of the Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that unlike the age of women to marry and have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the greater the age at marriage and have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which have elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time in the middle of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
" It also provides another division between women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary school, marry and have their first child before achieving a stable employment, the average levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to ensuring a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child ", detailing Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is
L'Oréal Paris just add a new name to its list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become image of various products of the mark, sang the universal slogan of ' because I '.
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, joins a number of other famous recruits of L'Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before that, the last to enter into such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (' lost ') and Freida Pinto (' Slumdog Millonaire ') .
In paragraph male, the cosmetics brand also has ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (' Grey's Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (colleague Evangeline in ' lost ') .
The British fashion Awards
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, held in London, the Royal Court justice.
No one missing.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen best model of the year.
The poker of
Manuel Vincent away in poker of aces ' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a 30 X - rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other) .
Gender does not do so in the foreseeable and frightening (biográfica, life and work) , but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the character creator.
The journey has its excitaciones and Vincent saves scares or iluminaciones.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and relecturas.
Here I leave some instant.
On Albert Camus: " in its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without giving name: the pleasure against the dark, morality without guilt and innocence without any God. "

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of some 70 years of age walking by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent together, and our dog, a copy of race, rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, two kicks that left the dog Malherido.
Our indignation is because we do not find the fun in a wanton aggression to a small animal and helpless, which incidentally, was tied.
Add to this the embarrassment that resulted in a Mrs strolling calmly and, when lashed to these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a madman that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at 5 p. m. on a Tuesday anyone by a district traditionally calm.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that serves much and not to generate sensitivities, just to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider fun maltreatment free to a defenceless animal that we love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the hull
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) , has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among the young motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while touring motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond design and manufacture products every day more secure " and said that also contributes to this goal through other actions of educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of the hull in the motorcycle, under the slogan ' to be or not to be ', will have a first phase in which will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles, with the goal of maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern " for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two - wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop insurance products.
The sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not, it should be put on hold because the reference to the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a drop of the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the resurgence of the last month, the accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the hotchpotch of the light commercial: derived from cars, pick up, pickup trucks, vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, have not disappeared the clouds that most affect their demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium - sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
Of closed So that the restrictions in the tap of bank loans, are other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background and unlike cars, have been of little help aid to the purchase of the 2000e.
To them eligible, in addition to individuals, the self - employed and SMEs to acquire a commercial light of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been.
Yesterday, since Ganvam returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses) .
The association of sellers predicts a similar to the year 2010, for which estimated a fall in sales (cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency brake assist is already mandatory
As happened with the anti - lock brakes ABS and about the stability control of ESP, emergency brake assist systems will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while the rest is set for a period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, on his way to work, it can also help prevent many collisions.
The assistant to the emergency brake what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects the pisotón that gives the driver.
But this does not always maintained that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use any force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, requires the maximum the brake system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one of every four claims would be avoided with damage to popularize people - when the so - called intelligent emergency brake system.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects obstacles and alerted the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, helps increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it fails to react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 probably Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that is going to need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may make the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, since GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admitted having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to China.
The decision to close Saab is at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For desarrolar his last, and expensive jewel, engineers took the Porsche Boxster S as basis and that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the báscula in kg.
This led them to dispense, firstly, the ceiling automatic drive which has been compensated by one of tarpaulin with manual, to save 21 kilograms; using aluminum doors as the Gt3, ' fall ' other 15; climatizador, 13; reducing the fuel tank of 64 54 litres, won 7 kg; other 12 and with the slight of 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the audio system cdr - 30 provided other six kilograms and changing the gunmen of the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
But with the change of the KDP also offers double, the test was carried out on a unit with the box six speeds, mainly for secondary roads of California, in sections with routes really revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as high.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car not the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: not long testábamos a model so small and light that, in turn, transmit such security in the curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until they get that esprinte, which slowed, recover and return to squeeze its engine ...
What we ask. Thanks to their leadership, as forthcoming as accurate, that we share with our hands in the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
Sound of the engine will
The sound of V6 Boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option ' sport ' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digirió the potholes.
Electronic aid barely did act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves are ice at dawn and already well into the morning.
In short, a car, the more fun to drive that one can in the market and that is something more than a simple amendment to the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

The labour Fund achieved a brilliant triumph by 82-91 during his visit to the complicated of Maccabi Electra with, despite the numerous casualties that had the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way is in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple was the best of his team (29 assessment) .
The team was able to fill the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, gardens or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end to victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 triple had much to do in the final triumph.
The party started for the azulgranas, which were made from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the vitorianos were from the perimeter was expectation that had come to the Israeli court with his wrists hot ..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés opted for the home game Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to its home, to continue to extend its advantage to rest (34-43) .
Teletovic already started to excel as the best of his team with 13 points, while the ' least six ' assessment of Splitter already made expectation that this was not going to be the best night of Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on track to rest, was not decided far less and the Maccabim wanted to remind the vitorianos that in its scope does not win anyone, and with ' the hand of the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the ' yellow ' around the shining (50-49) .
More disadvantages
The of Ivanovic, wounded but far fewer deaths, needed a couple of right for breath, and these came in the machine gun of Mirza, who with three consecutive triple and the help of English and the scoreboard Ribas returned to a reassuring income (54-67) , which managed to disguise the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67) .
The alaveses came to be the skin in the past partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone what had been paid were removed during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team are not and tried to keep alive his team from the line of three points (70-77) .
Despite this, and with Splitter removed by mistakes, not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis have the final minute (80-85) , the party was already owner and the victory from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.

The game shown in the first quarter allowed dream Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triple, two of the base Omar Cook and one of Guillem the local 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the premises in the domestic game with, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave the return to the scoreboard 22-20, minute 13, in which an action, near fight between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was the disqualification of both players.
The whole Greek started to show their superiority in both areas, where the low by injury of the English pívot Joel Freeland and three offences of Carlos Jiménez, were the cajistas.
Among the home players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas, with its triple, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.

The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last drop of the Scottish pívot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the disadvantages the Unicaja by the management and the triple of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when clutching and given their superiority in centimeters inside the area was unstoppable.

Brazil puts date at the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has put to the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must abandon the embassy diplomatic 27 January 2010 at the latest, when officially completed its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of Brazil's embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV globe that " Mel " knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where refugee from 21 September.

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant pattern in the markets, new uncertainty returned to reappear in the markets, which must not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the actors take decisions on the future nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free rein for liquidity at rates close to zero for the financial institutions purchasing assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and, without questioning their heterodox policy of liquidity, to throw some sand in the wheels how did the ECB with its auction to the year of the next week.
Therefore, the investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without measures as heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned to rally, although still far from the levels paranormales that reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to nationalise private risk and public debt returned to be affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an extension of the differences of the euro - zone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had been affected by this episode of instability but in that Standard& Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the characterization of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of the moral hazard that tried again to create awareness on those responsible for the global economic policy for the destructive effects of the restriction on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to order a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai it portrays a tribal struggle between the emirs to reshape the power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that is pulling the blanket.
Prodi in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin salvase Hungary of a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that will allow a member country of the euro to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and responsible to its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, how we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expectations.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt spreads extended like the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European differentials falling and our continued to expand, then it would be risk Spanish.
The Standard& Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate their scenarios of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not life expectancy to its warning.
Again, it is the whole pint will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, although for the moment " prudence, friend driver ".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the debate these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by the President of gas Natural - fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, gave the press a few of what had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.

Galán, who believes that the draft law on sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been calling for, did not want to make blood with the Royal decree to encourage consumption of coal, which contradicts the national policies to combat climate change.

Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, it must begin to take longer because late maturing and a stable framework is needed to address them.

Play the champions has brought 476,4 million to Madrid and Barca since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.
Therefore, Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, that makes them the third and fifth club that more money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the season 1992/1993, according to data from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out well from this distribution.
The white club has been the third of the continent that more money has been pocketed by participating, and the only, along with AC Milan, which has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list of the leading Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams, moreover, more money billed to participate the last Champions League.

On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that more money has achieved through the champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, four of Italy, the three of England and Germany) .
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure of distribution of money that applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini expected join 1.09 billion for the Champions League.
Of This money UEFA will 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the previous round of classification (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.

There is also bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and empatar (400,000 for each team) . The octavofinalistas will receive three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four embolsarán 4 million each.
The champion won 9 million, compared to 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in concept of fixed payments, a club at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, The 2.5 million by winning the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But it is also are variable payments, which are targeted 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
