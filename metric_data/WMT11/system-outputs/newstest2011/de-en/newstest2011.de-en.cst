What can they do? čssd the Czech social democrats in Prague are neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei '.
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously have to overcome certain barriers to their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague and in the Council to be able to understand stadtvertretung at all.
The newspaper has aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from čssd time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang over the past few years has naturalised, in which the current coalition in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, in the era of Pavel bém verflossenen mayor of the Prague political elite was introduced, some of the most prominent players, situations and causae entlehnt.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts in the dark.
The claim they at least.
"who is voldemort?"
'No idea. "
'I am a newcomer to the Prague policy', responded lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes'.
But the ratsherr Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the concept of 'golfloch'.
This is the only expression of those present here, I occasionally use '.
"otherwise, I do not often infiltrated by slang."
From the vocabulary of the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before wahlkongress the ODS had published, pickte the drawing-up of six notions, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague Government.
The Social Democrats should the concepts of "voldemort ',' greatest Prague golfloch ',' in the konditorei go ',' stiernacken ',' betrayal of capital 'and' verblechen '.
Three Prague ratsherren voted in favour of the test, the fourth - Mr weinert the future head of the Prague school system - promised firstly of its participation in the talks, but not even the listeners.
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I am indifferent to these matters and how the Civic Democrats themselves, I do not have sentences."
For me, it is how we understand in our programmes, "he made.
As has already been indicated, lukáš kaucký in the above-mentioned headline allegedly not recognised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek.
The term 'voldemort kaucky "says absolutely nothing, and the only one that he was correct erriet on the test," the biggest Prague golfloch'.
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to security but added: "But I know that more of the newspaper '.
And jokingly: "I will probably prove a sprachkurs."
The "golfloch 'will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also by the Environment ratsherrn lukáš plachý right as a tunnel blanka entziffert.
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the word voldemort and even lukáš plachý senses, where this figure is to be found and what it says, "in which" konditorei to go.
"I believe, that is to say, in any way to go," Prague gastronomiebetrieb plachý is fairly close to the conundrum hit solution, when we know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms.
In line with Březina asserts, but rather that this knowledge from the newspaper accessed, in that it adopt this vocabulary.
The testteilnehmern is anything to go by, it seems from the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang.
I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really not. "
"We call on us in the name, and we also use acronym or nicknames, 'says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - of his colleague in colloquial terms" hulda'.
In school I was bříza (birke), but I do not know whether I am also my fellow Members call ', tells us Karel Březina its nicknames.
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried and behold, it works.
Ratsherr weinert is for the colleague in the kind of "OPA 'or less friendly' old ', the representative Miroslav poche before the elections by machinations in partei-sponsoring vocal, some colleagues' igráček" (known Czech lego-figur).
Nicknames are the only one that the Social Democrats in whose language.
It may not hulínský supposedly if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered another nicknamed the Prague chairman.
His nickname "of" supposedly gummiknüppel-rechte has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský its title doctor Juris to bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants the torture of 'witches' stop and was a brochure,
Women in Burkina Faso for witches to be labelled, usually a number of common social characteristics.
They are more part of the older generation, they cannot find work, for example, for health reasons, they are constraint and do not have children.
If one of these women to hexe ,"" it is strictly isolated, to the rest of the village is not dangerous.
"men are very much affected by this fate."
"young and healthy women remains, since this will save them in the work to assist and bear children ', describes a ordensschwester the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a spezialheim by more than a hundred women, who have been expelled from their communities.
The ortsregierung decided now, against this abnormal "sozialmaßnahme '.
And, for this reason, a brochure which is designed to prevent the 'hexenverfolgung'.
The matter but has a catch.
More than 70% of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read, "the newspaper 'derstandard" on the dilemma of the written information.
Witchcraft is to be accused but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-jährige ammy hemmahová of three women and two men tortured to death - it alight with petroleum and simply.
On this matter, including the server BBC.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would be only a confluence of unfortunate circumstances.
Their version mentions oil inflamed to ritual salbungen will be used.
And, after the group tried, "a bad spirit 'of Mrs Hautala's good health'.
The isolation of 'witches' supporting people here, regardless of their education.
The "standard" quoted a 42-year old entrepreneurs from Burkina Faso: "fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso, at least, is seeking to defuse the gambianische President, last year the President himself properly mitgemischt.
"President yahya jammeh stirring up after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch-hunt, because these allegedly proportion to their death and were now to try, including the President himself by black magic kill."
"that he called schamane from the middle Guinea to help in the company of policemen, soldiers and bodyguard of Presidents indiscriminately detainees of men and women from gambianischen villages abducted and on the farm of Presidents in kanilai brought ', the organisation of Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm from prison people have been forced to a absud from plants with halluzinogener to drink, but also a bowel and nierenprobleme.
Two of the arretierten people survived the residence on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of bakala: It revives in the foot, but nevertheless pays higher rent
An older untersetzter man is leaving the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, the largest privatbesitzers of renting in the Czech Republic.
Among the poor, a file of three new mietverträgen three homes, for our own and the homes of his daughters, and his son, just one sentence.
All three within the framework of the so-called 'deregulation', it is precisely the rent.
Instead of 3 500 kroner monatsmiete is the son of next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with cuisine, the second category 4100 crowns berappen.
"There are, in the housing, not even a fluent hot water and heating must be a simple kohleofen ', for it is angry to point the finger at the new mietvertrag the son to signing a power.
"But what I signed the property," he says half and half resignedly annoying.
Bytyokd.cz's citizens' Association, the new mietbedingungen as "incorrect and immoral," the tenants, the new Treaties simply not to sign and until 7 December, in which it intends to publish a guidance, as against such contracts.
But the man beckons only.
"One says this, and the other is the ', it makes a benighted face.
The region is so much "Ostrava deregulierungslabor '.
After the new year, this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not been market-oriented rent figures.
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" personally.
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday brechend fully.
Alongside the door, the bodyguards of an agency and a aufrufgerät.
"rent 2011," is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen.
Briefly touched upon this and the appliance spuckt a nummernzettel.
No, we have no "157" piepst entziffert and on the large screen an indication of the ceiling of warteraums.
Half a minute later, the number.
A little later enter an older couple the warteraum after the rent, but the onslaught in warteraum is apparently not the new rent.
Most people are here to the usual problems to be resolved - reparaturanträge, insurance and so on.
From the middle of November fly in the region Ostrava the kuverts with the new mietverträgen most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of rpg in the post.
The rpg byty proposes to you in writing a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38%.
The specific counters for the new rent in klientenzentrum since 18 November.
"The action is something over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," answers the honourable behind the counters hesitate for a moment, as the 'legal' as a journalist dictator.
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker he lubomír zaorálek Ostrava originating from the čssd this issue very loudly, it is no wonder that today the newspapers flooded.
"twenty years, I would like you to a new peeled."
'No time ne besch wc-brille they could change. "the aforementioned man air.
Until now, the staff, especially pensioners switch to in order to convince the promised mietermäßigung whether they really receive them rpg promises, if you sign spezialangebot in good time.
The benefit of a half reduced februarmiete, other tenants, the new mietvertrag by 15 December.
Until now, "deregulierungsschalter 'havířov but anything else, as overburdened by questions.
'from yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011, "because we appreciate the schalterbeamtinnen.
Rpg offers both on their websites, as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary.
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent some will of an independent court.
"that is not a threat, but as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," says rpg on their websites.
"This is no court," says one of the workers from rpg byty and a man on the street before klientenzentrum is their right, at least in part.
"I have 13,000 (SEK) pensions, I remain 5,000 for food, where I should find the money for a gerichtsstreit," he says.
Only then will the employees but uncertain.
'time. "
'Mr zaorálek tells them on the media, they should not sign and for the people, "and they are of concern.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic demonstrated in 2011 and, according to the mieterhöhung rpg byty is an economic necessity.
"the existing level of rent is not enough time for the maintenance of the wohnfonds from" argues Pavel klimeš, Director of the society wohnungs-portfolios rpg byty and - particularly the disgruntled tenants criticised the neglect of the opinion of the homeowner wohnungsfonds is the main reason for the mieterhöhung.
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 collected from the four billion rent in the homes have been able to invest in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it to 5.2 billion.
On the großformatigen lcd-display the ceiling to the polstersesseln warteraum havířov broadcast by the surface always a few red shining information.
"mieterhöhungen in 2011 to 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of rpg."
"always does this mean only 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is on the lcd-monitor to read.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg increases the rent by 38%.
In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low mietpreise of 19,66 CZK per square metre, "argues rpg.
When 2600 housing remains the rent in the next year at the same level.
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rents, not in the stratosphere, but gradually within four or eight years.
What is more, it imposes a further obligation: all the revenue from the mieterhöhung (see graph), the companies in the housing, especially in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But, primarily, those who benefit from the people, the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
The architects saw - the office is also a kindergarten
The office avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company arch.design.
But who would have been a minikindergarten expect, with all that includes: farbenfrohen walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse.
This kindergarten, since last year's arch.design available.
The projektierungs- and architekturbüro arch.design, whose ateliers a whole series of eminent brünner buildings, expected of the first drafts for the new building avriopoint with the premises for his firmen-minikindergarten.
In wise, because most of its 90 staff (inward) are babyboom-alter and the company is keen that the projektantinnen architektinnen as quickly as possible and returning to work.
Together with the possibility of shortening work, is the kindergarten another bonus that arch.design its employees in the concept of their sozialprogrammes to offer.
The -architektinnen bauingenieurinnen and have it easier for their ambitious work and child care.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of staff (inward) arch.design and with the support of the management managed financial assistance from the European Union and the Ministry of work and Social Affairs for their project.
The occupational minikindergarten the operationsprogramm resources and employment policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the state reacts to the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of EUR 2, 8 million CZK), the necessary facilities and equipment procured and for a period of two years for qualified personnel and for the operation.
The utilisation of the funds (2) is society arch.design committed to the minikindergarten 3 years at their own cost.
The preparation of this project, a whole year, and the social economy in the rating antragsabwicklung effective aid.
The children are ganztätig qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin, the kindergarten can visit altersmäßige children without restrictions, although most of them over three years of age.
And because it is a mini-kindergarten is, only 5 children to be present, however, pass the day over several children each other.
The kindergartenbetrieb is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of staff in relation to the use of kindergartens the same rights - regardless of the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the programminhalt in mini-kindergarten however, comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education brings.
The children play here is not only, above all, you will be excellent teaching needed - of basic knowledge to vorschulunterricht, incidentally, they learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative, but also with a computer, of children is available.
What is more, the presence of young children in the company contributes to a valuable and positive firmenmilieu.
Parents can always look at children, and so will stress the belated and children from a far-off kindergarten.
Parents therefore serve their working hours more productive.
No surprise, then, that this natural and loyal relations.
Arch.design included so under the Czech firms in the recruitment of new staff to offer significant benefits that such programmes are family-friendly and their personnel marketing.
A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years, if you look at the interieure of Gaudi on
The roof is on the backs of prehistoric echse, the stairs as the vertebral column and which are one dinosauriers balkone aufgerissene fischmäuler.
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architects Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants experienced the House with his organic forms been nicknamed "knochenhaus'.
Organic forms, wild paints, the unusual use of stone kachelsplittern and jigsaw creating to shed "facades and ubiquitous soft routes, all of these are typical features of the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the House plays with beautiful lines zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and human beings.
On closer inspection observes that everything of geometry rhythm and thoughtful order dominated.
In the night, the whole facade or plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the House.
Wood creates ripple geformtes imitates the window frames, support, zierelemente doors, even gucklöcher and afford.
The House batlló eixample the quarter of crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese pointed out.
The reconstruction, two years and was detailed.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately it agreed the idea gaudís in an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa outlined mietshaus batlló Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architects of José Maria jujol together.
Just on the drawing board, the dekorationen for representative apartment of realitätenbesitzers and the use of mosaiken of the façade was his idea.
In shaping the façade was, however, also many other bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí.
As participated jujol on the construction of gaudís House Casa milá güell in the park, in which further work by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknamed "knochenhaus'.
Others have called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House '.
It also says that at the top of the building was the sword of the Holy Georg, the existence of Catalonia.
But even further bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí outlined in this House for the time with unique zentralheizungssystem entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen.
It seems a little bizarre 45-grad-neigung already.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the codes and could not be misled by this.
In baubeginn Holte, it is the city of the corresponding planning a but which he indicated on the planned restructuring were so vague that stadtväter two years later in finalising so horrified by the result was that they remedy.
The ratsherren breathed, inter alia, that the construction of its pillars, even in the public pavement intervention.
On the amendments, but, on the contrary, only fifteen days after the request of Josep batlló stadtviertels presented a request for approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and he was promptly.
The homeowners themselves, in the lower echelons.
In the gallery, in the second stock was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and privaträume of housing.
The ground-floor level was a juweliergeschäft leased.
The entire sechsstöckige buildings is going through a stairs, right up to the dachterrasse.
The main elements of the adaptation were all right corner and precise lines removed and replaced by gebogene and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be achieved through the opening of salontüren completely, and this has led to a more comfortable plaudern society without compromising vertraulicheren talks on a certain degree of privacy.
The House has received through gaudís restructuring but a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors.
It is also impressive gaudís game with the light and the blue and White glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and lichthöfe.
The operation of these two colours gives all the floors of the House to a maximum light.
In this, he is simply to take advantage of the principle that knows better reflect the light, as the dark paints, the sunlight on the contrary.
This House, Mr Casa, the 2005 batlló welterbe-liste UNESCO has been included today everybody can visit.
In the first stock is geräumigste prächtigste housing and made available to the public.
The homeowner resolutely take years to take this step and that on the occasion of the famous 150.geburtstags creator.
As we said that this is a very profitable business activities, maintained the surveys, indeed we extended it to other common and dachgeschossräume, including dachterrasse.
The price to visit the baudenkmals is, however, no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20% reduction.
This amount out-performs the eintrittspreise other gaudí-bauten in the city.
The real atmosphere of the House with his drachentürmchen know would like to learn, should try, friendship with one of the inhabitants and to visit him.
The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women have other desires than men
Not tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche matratze rost - and make good bed.
This must, however, harmoniously complement to the wishes of the concrete user.
The choice to play a role on many issues - the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers.
Equally important is the interieur, and subordinate matratze rost.
Typical example?
In a wochenendhaus, which are not regularly heated latexmatratzen not suitable for much longer, as they need to be "hot."
Moreover, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen.
And - you should regularly be turned.
If they do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen, in essence, even on a firm plate, staut, humidity, so it is not excluded that their schimmel.
The choice is, of course, also a role, in which it is used.
Who, for a long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht, will be difficult to a low matratze used with hard surface.
"All an ice-hockey player from the nhl have returned to have complained to me that you are not able to sleep more correctly."
'for their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hüften they need simply weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer) '.
"I recommend including zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system, so that the 'information' from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel.
That is why I voted for several years, many eishockeyspielern, but also other customers with these matratzen visco-schaum (memory foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including the manufacturer, the Italian company tempur magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico."
And it is not necessarily a famous an ice-hockey player, the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on hot body.
Nowhere is there, in the night shifts are not around for a serious fight.
We sleep much better.
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene).
In the choice of matratzengröße should still be at the height of the length of fußsohlen to, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
As Mrs Mann, the 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, i.e. 180 cm.
When einzelbetten singles, for example, 120 to 140 cm.
The own comfort, and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: 'If you are on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor, "advises the ING. Helena prokopová zunftmeisterin the polsterer raumausstatter, and for years the issue of healthy schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture devoted to this issue put on colleges.
In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and its own matratze, but be careful when buying products, so that the matratzen too high.
Otherwise, cannot do other than roste in different levels to make, and that is not in any bettrahmen possible.
Schaummatratzen should at least 14 cm high, with 15 cm matratzen federskelett, it should at least three centimeters on formschicht and feinpolster.
'with the hands or sit down the feathers in no case be felt, "warns Helena prokopová.
Any matratze makes a particular rosttyp required.
With matratze ganzgepolsterte beds and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom.
These matratzen cannot drop and the respect we cannot wash, which today is already commonplace.
And as a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years, a huge (and congested sieve).
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promises.
In any case, your ifs and buts.
And is therefore a practical advice of traders: matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren emolument that, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, easy to use and wash.
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss, so it is open to the two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and waschmaschinengröße!), the manipulation with larger matratzen, particularly, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Have you in the bed rostes instead of a firm plate?
Out of it.
Or, at most, a bed of unloved guests and for a single night.
So they should rather prosaic with lüftungslöchern oversight (if any), and there are already matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use.
Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document.
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable or sandwichmatratzen latex- (possibly also combinations of latex and kokos), figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, 28 and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate.
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung.
In addition to the cessation of rigid the special flexible schultermodule federleisten will also be required.
We are talking about a specific integration of federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even to the specific einsinken the shoulders of schläfers.
Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter.
There are even matratzenhersteller which have started in "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for schulterbereich.
The President is intended - you off these weichzonen in hüftgegend.
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with the so-called multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduces the tension.
But, if the right matratze and right rost a bad (too big and fülliges) kopfkissen used the most benefits are lost.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: kopfkissen is the head, its leaders should only to shoulder the rich, so that the schultermuskeln relax.
Ideal is therefore a great kissen 50 X 60 cm, as for example the Scandinavians.
In the seitenlage should kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or weichzone in matratze) schulterhöhe.
Some have our modern matratzen with the former (with hay EU-US) strohsäcken but in common.
Modern manufacturers are using increasingly natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
When matratzen means the new magic word 'bio'.
Rather than erdölrohstoffen we used to manufacture polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, sojaöl rizinus-.
Soya is known by all manufacturers.
"bio matratzen, that is to say in their heart of material is a purely natural origin," says Petr vašíček tropico plus of the company.
Naturstoffe but also in the production of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera.
We can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep of fresh forest or lavendelduft.
Here, too, there is a difference between men and women.
While the men 'kühlender "pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern used, so that the matratzenbezug heat and cooling can absorb the body, the salary for women' wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation of the weaker sex is the sleep wohlig warm words.
And today's favourites?
From kaltschaum matratzen (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than handelsübliches polyurethan and much more flexible).
The combination of the various stiff (toughness) kaltschäumen visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise and to know exactly where capita hip and closely.
For a high-quality matratze is 7 000 kroner and more berappen.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually burdened with lower VAT, but as a medical aid.
The first Czech company was gumotex this advantage.
You see, the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen for the price of one.
The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will be free to do so.
It was the material tempur that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace.
No wonder they have been but for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to launch huge überbelastungen.
Tempur in heat soft, in a cool environment to entrench it in turn.
So it is the human body, perfect and distributed in the best possible way körperdruck.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent druckbrand but increased general schlafkomfort.
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used the legs and the gefäßen provide relief.
For example, the use of domestic manufacturers schaumstoffe eucatherm C twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want menschen-überwachungsgeräte kids under control, in order to have
The fear for one's children is growing, and so are considering more and more parents, by GPS.
The system that was originally to searching for cars was invented, namely people, as well as in such cases would be helpful, as recently in spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year anička janatková.
This is about the same size as a packet but soon it will be no more than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the disappearances anička horrified and so you are looking at ways and means to bring up their children to be better protected.
The price of a deterioration of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is not in any way herumspionieren, but an effective means to lessen the likelihood that the tragedy is, Petr pilin society macro because, and one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I admit that in the case of the misuse of such equipment, for example if there is someone in the bag, without knowing, but so far we have had no such case."
"The most customers buy it really is for reasons of security ', adds pilin.
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" is and how it can be used in the event of an emergency.
The kinderpsychologin Dana bočková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing, it does not bear its simple pace.
"very small children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they are not supervised."
"The phones awoken initially with the parents have great expectations, but they are just as easy to shut down, as this new überwachungsgeräte," says Mrs bočková.
In your opinion, is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack, actually helps.
'planned kidnappings controlled the kidnappers virtually always whether the child in any electronics, which could be located. "
"Today it is mobile phone."
"If such überwachungsgeräte broader use of publicized, they would also seek them, since their sale surely accompanied by massive advertisements."
In these cases, the perpetrators of the police always one step ahead, "says the psychologist.
It acknowledges that similar devices with a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful.
Roberta čech society RC monitoring - ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars, as well as for persons, can the existence of such a appliance can also help if it immediately after the attack will be destroyed.
"The machine, so that the respective position in some intervals."
"even if it is immediately destroyed, at least the final position of the person involved. '
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if we are being left bewegungslos hinfällt and sends the device immediately a warning for the position," claims Mr čech.
In his opinion, could similar services also smart phones with navigation, we only have a special software einzuspielen.
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either in order to appliances in streichholzschachtel-größe, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that it loses.
Mr pilin of the macro testing because, in the present equipment, such as normal digitaluhren.
This has the advantage that the possible attackers did not realise that this is a monitoring and localisation device which makes it possible.
"or he realises that only after a certain time, as the police is a zeitvorsprung ', adds it.
No matter what direction the development - towards armbändern or supporters, are still the same technology, such as the fahrzeugortung.
Therefore, the combination of ortungsfunktion through the gps-systems (just as the navi in the car) and the role of a mobile phone, which is the current position.
The army has so many zündschnüre that we could keep the Czech Republic umwickeln but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre shop, with explosives to be released.
In the previous year, the Ministry has 224 kilometres of powder to the armeelager.
It is reassuring to know that the forces for 225 years ausgesorgt.
The only problem is the durability of the zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the zündschnüre of the company stv group, including S. for a mere 40 million kroner.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of powder replied the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 km powder.
The sourcing of armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes according to the point that came from this indication that the whole army every year an extremely intensive pyrotechnics training should, from all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, to the secretaries and Putzfrauen.
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general vlastimil picek not excluded.
Only in this way can the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length is also actually 25,000 detonationen.
But if these armeebestände for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by these neueinkäufe, also from the point of view of the increased needs of the key and special units - a soothing stock for the above-mentioned 225 years.
It complained soldiers of the Defense Minister Vondra schnelleinsatzbrigade recently, they have almost no patronen for small arms register, so that the lack of resources for severely constrained.
The unterhosenmangel.
'I am not, why we are buying such huge zündschnüre. "
But that is your decision, you will already know what they need it. "
For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to achieve as much as possible as traders', says the vertriebsmanager of Jan děcký stv group.
Jan pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman establishes the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army would be so for at least ten years with the "ammunition" heckle him.
Jan děcký of the stv group is, however, a four-year gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker only two years.
'With perfect storage are the four aforementioned years possible', one of them, but turns wants to remain as a soldier, not the criticism of the army to be accused.
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether they are reliable and not the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not in vain, it costs money.
A further point is the Department of Defense mengenrabatt for 445 kilometre powder.
"They cost us 60% less than the letztjährige delivery of 244 kilometres', tells us pejšek einkäufer spokesman, the position of the Department of Defense.
Just by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war, or the Soviet bruderarmee than they have been for a number of years, barely 1 500 metres.
And the police state, only such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume.
The safety of pyrotechniker because, in addition, be able to make purchases more flexible and hence reliable zündschnüre openly.
In any case, the Ministry has huge problems with the winding-up of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak people " s army continuously in their campaign on the Rhine prepared.
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes, awaits the Czech forces in a few years, the same problem with the winding up of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre today as' beneficial 'shop.
Until today, the contacts I had won thanks to the competition
The victorious ranking in competition 'entrepreneurs of the year' lukáš pytloun in the sale of the discount of hotels.
The winners of the last jahrganges of competition 'entrepreneurs of the year' lukáš pytloun from carried out by Liberec.
The history of his success sounds like a filmszenarium.
Lukáš pytloun went.
Only abroad, he was aware that it is carried out by Liberec good übernachtungsmöglichkeiten at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his ferienarbeiten abroad and using a century ago he bankkredits baufälliges House with five homes.
Bearing in mind that he then hochschulstudent in the sixth semester was that this was certainly a daunting.
"The former preis-qualität-verhältnis angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says lukáš pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte housing rented in auslandsarbeiter.
The whole profit gave it back to the House that he then step by step to retirement with 54 beds umbaute.
Since it managed in just seven years of entrepreneurial activities carried out by Liberec four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels, with a total of over 300 beds of all unterkunftskategorien.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the viersternehotel "pytloun design hotel."
In this year, another first-class hotel.
"We have just had a contract with a hotel in ostrov U tisé signed, which we have sold franchise-konzept and other interested parties on the discount of pytloun-hotels have already reported," says the number one last year.
"large share of this lizenzverkauf the instigation of hotels have just had the victory in competition 'entrepreneurs of the year', Mr pytloun admiration.
The victory has greater awareness and popularity in carried out by Liberec and environment.
"The people saw me on the street, often gratulierten me even downstream, and I must say that the fact that he is well '.
I commend all, want to create in this competition.
We need not just to gain any visible is good.
He says that he is so far from the contacts and acquaintances use to which it is not.
With some people, whom I thank for competition, I still hold regular business relationship. "
With the success of the glory, in his opinion, a little in any of its staff.
And that is the seventy.
"I notice in them greater loyalty and proud that they are part of the general recognition."
I see this really is not just as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work done by us all. "
"My name is just something to the fore," says lukáš pytloun modest.
My successors, I wish a ruhigeres year, when we had farmet
The euphoria of victory for was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition has farmet the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year, in the last year, Karel žďárský, the company owners from farmet.
The jury commemorated the efforts which it from the small werkzeugbau in Česká skalice a company from the land of improvised parliamentary, hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this not only myself but also encouraged all my colleagues and our self-confidence in the battle with the competition has encouraged ', says the vorjahresgewinner.
At the beginning of the corporate life was of farmet the effort to do something useful.
And when the state his father Karel žďárský as compensation for the communists confiscated property a small workshop to lease offered hesitated for a long time, it was his career in the company, in which he was working in the meantime sausen and founded with a few comrades of his father, a separate company to manufacture plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on pflanzenölpressen.
Within 18 years, they are the largest producer of automatic drain throughout Central Europe.
But it is only through the success of the aforementioned competition and whose medialisierung it is also aware of the nicht-fachöffentlichkeit.
Not only that our customers the brand farmet are now much more intense, our foreign partners began the fact that a company can cooperate in your country, the greatest possible success, has acquired greater value to attach, "says Karel žďárský.
The past year has farmet, however, not only in the context of the euphoria of victory for.
The appraisal was based on the economic results of the company in 2008, and a portion of 2009.
And it is precisely in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of werkzeugbauprodukten.
The crisis, still less for the citizens, but above all companies schüttelte, reached its peak in particular, many companies have been forced to stop their investment projects, and the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
'this situation we could, of course, not miss. "
"The turnover went by 40%, we have had to limit production, and even to resort to redundancies," says Karel žďárský
A viable businesses must also sometimes such unpopular measures.
It was, however, the situation and the company in the black figures, although lower than before the crisis.
One was unwilling to make cuts in investment in research and development.
'from the buildings we grant a research and schulungszentrum we bestärkten our presentation on international measure and bought hauptpreise domestic exhibitions, "says žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales will grow, and with them the number of new staff.
"The new victor, I wish you all pleasures of the victory, but ruhigerer atmosphere ', Karel žďárský.
An opinion poll, with nonsensical regulations removing
The survey of the absurdity of the year 'is the fourth part of the unternehmerwettbewerbs.
Some nonsensical regulations managed, from the world.
The dubious winners of the next generation strive to attain the poll 'absurdity of the year' in the duty of documents on the authorities, the online available.
So more than one-third of all four stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
As a requesting the sozialversicherungsverwaltung papierauszug from the handelsregister, even if the officials would have two mausklicks access.
Thanks to the poll is changing this now.
"The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung will in future be in control of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the handelsregister more ', the spokeswoman of čssz Jana buraňová.
The purpose of the poll 'absurdity of the year', it is that all the rules and orders to scrutinise the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to meet and nonsensical.
This is the fourth time this year has been part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs of tsch. Business newspaper (hn) will be hosted and publicly growing popularity.
If, in the last year of the three thousand people in the vote, it was in this year of four thousand.
No wonder, because there is still a lot of legal obligations, which only serves to impede the business.
"What, for example, the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned, we are taking a front rank in the world ', says Karel havlíček of the unification of small and medium-sized businesses and gewerbetreibender of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in recent years the proclaimed aim of all the governments.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic but hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the rank, 74. Compared to the previous year, one in eight places worse ranking.
The competition of the absurdity of the year, for the first time in years, and has declared itself every year for equal scenario.
Everyone can from April until the redaktionsschluss of competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
Registration is the website address www.firmaroku.cz. beyond the organisers of competition seven candidates for the "antipreis' and the public Internet websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
The triumph of the absurdity of the majority of the votes.
In this year's poll have already been more than one hundred, 105 pointless regulations and orders.
The clues are not only of entrepreneurs, but also of professional organisations and journalists.
Among the nominees' finalisten "of competition, for example provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge for motorways and express roads toll on figures, or entrepreneurs with twenty members of staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years.
The list of this' seven 'is on the side of competition.
The proclamation of competition at the beginning of November on Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happenings in which regularly also figures of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva svobodová, the director of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and the tsch gewerbetreibender. Republic and Petr kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, the culmination of the tsch of competition with the game.
"where the state of the entrepreneurs spanner into the works, there can be no genuine economic recovery, so it is my aim, every year at least thirty paragraphs that today the entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their undertakings', telling Martin kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.
The efforts of nonsensical orders, show ineffective.
In 2007 the most troubled people, the entrepreneurs, the obligation imposed on the ground gewerbeamt permanent company three days in advance the intention to declare, with a ausstellungsstand an exhibition or kirmes want to travel.
This duty was a series of gewerbegesetzes lifted.
The duty to 2007, the second largest number of votes received - the duty to refunding the job of workers in the scope of up to 30 days to declare - by the law on the so-called 'green card' abolished.
And, all good things are three:
The absurdity of the 2009 regulation, it imposed sprechzimmer physiotherapeuten in a mirror, a refrigerator and two personenwaagen.
This regulation was the Ministry of this year - which was somewhat mitigated kühlschrankpflicht.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's already fifth batch of competition of the business newspaper (hn) is the category of 'good company of 2010'.
Idea of this competition is reasonable and fair ventures.
'We want these firms to assist the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment are aware and socially responsible support initiatives', says that the Patrik bartholdy regionalmanager mobilfunkunternehmens vodafon ausrufer and the guarantor of this competition, and competition "rebel of the year '.
This year's first batch of this particular underclass of hauptwettbewerbs vodafon company of the year from firms, for the success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would be enough to create a self-employed rule.
Although it is in relation to the subject of their activities diametrically opposed to distinguish their efforts, however, have a common denominator - support and concern.
This is, for example, gehandicapte people, to personal problems or the health of their own staff.
Among the fourteen finalisten appeared from the Czech Republic, for example the Prague software et netera to the emergence of not formal sportteams among their staff, then in numerous tournaments in sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region pardubice is society isolit-bravo, the main sponsor of seventeen years gehandicapte stiftungsfonds for children.
A paper mill from poděbrady is exemplary in their state of health of disabled people, which account for 70% of its workforce, and with the title 'good company of the region mittelböhmen' has been appreciated; on competition Vodafone company of the year documented in this region, the third place.
In the region olomouc won the buchhaltungsfirma miryz soft, amongst other things, a fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week introduced reduced working hours without cutting wages, and this mistrust.
The jury honorierte in titelverleihung also the fact that the company predominantly in Czech manufacturers buy, citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and support for green principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible the impact of our entrepreneurship and administration for the environment to minimise," declared their geschäftsführerin miluše ryznarová.
The responsible it companies enlogit from the region ústí nad Labem, in turn, is the health of its people and that is why you all notebooks ergonomische benches and tastaturen equipment, it also promotes them in their employees work and they cartering-dienstleistungen firmenaktionen used by a domestic protected workshop.
"We also support the Foundation" people in distress, "which spotted roma-kommunität concrete aid," says Ondřej suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, is the activity of a "praní reinigungsfirma čištění 'from the Karlsbad region worthy of their employees in the form of extra-bonussen to their pensions.
"We give our workers, contributions to meals, for the distances, to increase their skills and for the holiday," says Josef strapáč czasch from the construction company from bruntál, the winner in the mährisch-schlesischen region.
The category of responsible company of the year were automatically all bezirksfinalisten of competition vodafon company of the year, the issues of the notification enclosed questionnaire beantwortetet and by the latest 15.august the organisers zuschickten.
Please wrong or incomplete answers to the questionnaire, the organisers of the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the wetteifernden firms the unanswered questions, they were the competition 'good company of the year', in hauptwettbewerb Vodafone company of the year, therefore, but they were not disqualified."
"a separate notification only to this competition is not possible, because it is only an underclass of hauptwettbewerbs company of the year," says Karel Goldman from organising agency bison & rose.
Pilsner bodenfonds - arrests of the police in a public tender
In the buildings of bodenfonds in Pilsen antikorruptionspolizei, in the last few days, arrests.
It was the abandonment and immobilienhändler medien-unternehmer luboš G. the detektiven defrayed in handcuffs.
This was supposed to be a particularly ongoing public competition on restitutionsansprüchen manipulate the competitive land offered a specific interested zufielen.
This is luboš G. for half a million paid.
'at this stage, I can only confirm that the police of a person for the crime of fraudulent activity in a public competition persecuted, "said antonie zelená pilsner prosecutor, the head of the newspaper' právo ', it could further details in relation to the ongoing investigations are not granted.
Twenty-four hours later, the 46-jährige entrepreneurs from the police.
In what way the public competition could manipulate, that can be given the low official information only speculate.
The spokesman of the bodenfonds lubomír černá led to the question of právo, the police have pilsner bodenfonds antenna of arrests and, indeed, during a public competition.
"It was a client and not by one of our colleagues' explicit.
The public competition was Mrs černá the correct designation 'call for tender claims on the transfer of land, in accordance with the bodengesetz "and would take place in cases in which several applicants interest in the land offered bezeigen.
"the people within the framework of the invitation to offer a higher value of the transfer to begleichenden restitutionsansprüche than the proclaimed grundstückswert."
'in accordance with the demands of the sequence of the potential acquirer, then gives the bodenfonds the land on the person with the highest supply, "says the spokesman of the fund.
Luboš G. were obvious information is available to anyone on the request was notified and since he was justified person, as it does, a number of restitutionsansprüchen had bought, he offered a grundstücksinteressen that he withdraws from the competition.
Obviously, against a fats compensation.
It would also be a sufficient explanation of why it in his arrest such a large amount of money in itself.
Luboš G. had already, in the past too good contacts with pilsner bodenfonds.
So he played in the issue of the former head of the bodenfonds Václav sankota a role, has been prosecuted because it finalised ersatzrestitutionen land, which has already been taken standortentscheidungen to construction projects.
At that time, the aforementioned luboš bodenfonds for example, land on the construction of public roads were destined, more precisely, to the point at which the construction of the industrial area zufahrtsmagistrale borské pole was planned.
Later, he even changing this very favourably with the government against a House directly in the historic centre of the city, the value of the land far exceeded.
The city hall had to then reluctantly kleinbeigeben, the construction of the blocking of the land.
The housing of households will increase by several hundred per month
Households need from January, not only with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with higher water and abwassergebühren and district heating and some grow the rent.
Families are as from January, several hundred kroner per month must learn more from their wallets than it has been so far.
Electricity by 4.6% more expensive gas at 2% or more, in some cities will be up to one tenth of wasserlieferungen figures must become more expensive and in some places the fernwärmelieferungen.
The mere stromteuerung costs wohnungshaushalte every year, a few hundred kronor.
The starkstrompreise have been reduced by all the main suppliers, guilt is the clear promotion of electricity produced from renewable sources, notably from fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas is moderately expensive, but this is exactly where the people most heating and have the highest consumption.
This is, therefore, with a few hundred kronor per year.
While gas and electricity in the Czech Republic be more expensive, are the prices for district heating from city to city varied.
Above all, more places to price increases.
It must, for example, households in pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating up to 50 kronor per month to pay more than 1000 kronor per year are paying families in carried out by Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9% higher water and abwassergebühren and it is the case that the city of the infrastrukturmiete increased.
If the rent does not change, and there are only 6.8%.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole of the Czech Republic, however, continues to be the lowest.
In northern Bohemia, where the prices are already among the highest, should abwassergebühren 7.4% of water and to increase.
Enormous mietpreiserhöhungen, for example, in renting 140,000 to expect that from January the so-called mietregulierung disappearing.
It is, for example, the housing associations CPI byty in ústí nad Labem 2500 flats, rents from January regardless of 100%.
Anyone who does not agree with this mieterhöhung the courts to companies.
The regulated rent, still today, in approximately 300 000 homes pays, next year by more than 10% increase.
Czech children with the highest Fernet and rum beer is out - it is simply too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, just for once, is also a good whisky, the father of the hausbar has stolen.
These are the drinks, which enjoy drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most notbehandelt.
No exception are children, their hangovers ausschlafen repeatedly in the hospital.
This is apparent from the experiences of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics.
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get."
The current trend is clearly hard alcohol, "said právo luděk Pelikán, the kinderabteilung chefarzt mittelböhmischen hořovice in the clinic.
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of hausbar to ours and, if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
'vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then, it is not as strong, "says the chefarzt.
The spokesman of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right.
"the most concerns Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alkoholtrend, notably in primary schools."
"occasionally it was also about slibowitz, we feel at home ', Mrs jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán, dreizehn- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme been no exception.
Before the clinic in hořovice, since this year, he was ten years in the hospital pädiatrie-abteilung motol, where the ambulances angetrunkene pupils from far and wide ablieferten.
"a girl had hospitalisiert four times."
"their careers began with 12 years ago, when the first time it with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" extase "was" the doctor was described in a particularly serious case.
"It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty."
'What is interesting is that their mother is not strange found that 48 hours is not your daughter came home, "is the chefarzt.
It is the lack of interest of the parents or the incredible tolerance to initiate their own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A genuine dependency in the true sense of the word, according to the experts, in children.
"alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case for these children."
Those who repeatedly alcohol enjoy is often a negative characteristic familiär-sozialer background, "says chefarzt Pelikán.
The spokesman of the hospital motol, Mrs jurinová, until the middle of November around forty drunken children in the abandonment of department for child and jugendmedizin trained.
However, only the cases of serious alkoholvergiftung, in hospital was needed, in the statistics.
Drunken children who, after ambulatory care of the parents or, if necessary, by the police brought home will not be recorded.
Apart from the cases in which children only as a bottle of spirits in schulbank austrinken there is the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, to the 100% reliance is: walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"the latter for two reasons, either from distress because of the poor testimony or joy on the holiday."
"walpurgisnacht I have seven drunken children in the inclusion of experiences," stresses Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes baby, the night under medical supervision spends, paradoxically, better off than one child, the next day, only with a unpleasant hangover.
The headaches on the morning after the dehydration and the glukosemangel, in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose produced and nutrients, the absence of the organism.
"You are clearly better off, because according to the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise it with good humour, without somewhere somewhat ache."
"You are only a little confused about where they are ', Dr Pelikán, recognising the patients sometimes at least the good humour to perish by giving you the cost of that year, the treatment costs.
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in a akutbett are well on a few tens of thousands of kroner.
"and I have used this as erziehungsmittel if I directly to the children in the visit meant what their drunkenness have cost, and that it can happen that you all the holidays on working to ensure that the money for one such fete to earn," added doctorate Pelikán.
In his view, the health insurance funds, regressverfahren in curing the costs trunkenen children from parents.
Two trainingsflugzeuge l-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two slight warplanes l-159 a total of five of the Czech Ministry of defence against the transport aircraft Casa c-295m are exchanged on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturers Casa - EADS, devolve.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they have only manoeuvres or flugshows.
We are talking here about flugfähige zweisitzerversion l-159t1 by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige l-159.
These are currently still einkonserviert aero vodochody, the mediator in this business, the company omnipol - it has adopted last week.
When the aircraft physically from vodochody expediert, Jan pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman is not yet known.
The fighter einsitzigen l-159, in turn, have been stored aircraft from being singled out in the long term, and this without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry.
"doppelsitzigen l-159t1 in current situation and to be exchanged," said the newspaper pejšek právo.
He added that the army will not manage without zweisitzige fighter, because the ministry in May 2009 with a aero vodochody 200-millionen-vertrag on the reorganization of four superfluous l-159 zweisitzigen version to be signed.
A new plane, the army in July, the second wants it by the end of this year.
According to the EADS pejšek has undertaken the fighter planes in the installation of the NATO countries.
"in the Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS buyer of aircraft l-159, and that this training of pilots, the NATO countries.
It is therefore a matter of abnehmers, in what way the matter he realised, "led pejšek.
The business newspaper (hn) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the l-159.
Barter payments of five l-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor, over the last year, the government of Mirek Topolánek has been approved.
The Defense Ministry had had to buy a call to tender EADS, but spoke directly.
The former verteidigungsamt argued that this exchange will in future be exporting l-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought aero 72 machinery, of which only 24, the rest of it.
The purchase of aircraft, Casa should, incidentally, also a legal process.
The European Commission verklagte the Czech Ministry, the European Court of Justice because it would have the aircraft on the basis of a ganzeuropäischen tender and not to have to choose by a single producer.
The army has already been three aircraft Casa, the last is within fourteen days on the airport kbely land.
A long finger than ringfinger means a lower risk that we will develop cancer
Men, the finger is long, as the ringfinger, are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is a surprising result of a study on the Wednesday of the British journal of cancer has been published.
This is the mirror of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can be used and, in particular, for men to sixty ', said the mitautorin the study Ros eeles krebsforschungsinstitut, a professor at the university in WARWICK.
The finger could help to determine which men are necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors, such as, for example, family health burdens, added Mrs eeles.
In the period from 1994-2009 pursued it with their colleagues in Brittany more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants of the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as well as for 19% of those men, whose 'ring' and fingers equally long.
In men, whose fingers longer than the ringfinger was, however, this risk fell by 33% for men and 60 even 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two aforementioned finger, which is already in the prenatal age are obviously reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen to which the child in the womb was exposed.
Less testosterone is a lengthy fingers.
Former research found that the testosterone accelerated growth of prostate cancer.
Václav pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he was čtk this study fleetingly known, but nevertheless it is the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer has not been proven for "no."

American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon. "
The American troops in Afghanistan have, for the first time, a new "smart" weapon, which previously only under your codebezeichnung xm-25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon to the conflict with the Taliban and the balance of power in their favour.
The new weapon is such a thing as a supergenaue.
Their projektile, by lasers with a accuracy of just a few metres objective.
The specific projectiles of mould 25 mm for firing were developed and dangerous explosive, function practically as small mortars.
The shells can be programmed so that it is not only the impact on the goal, but at any point in your ballistic flugbahn explode.
This means that they can be used against an enemy behind a barrier - a wall or the schützengraben.
The top is that it is usually not protected, the murderous stahlsplitterregen upwards can therefore easily stand out.
Richard audett according to the development of xm-25 stakeholders, is the new kampfgewehr the first infanteriewaffe 'smart' technologies to harness.
"The soldier is basically so: it is seeking the objective and sends a laser beam in the distance, so it will gain a precise visierpunkt, after which he erhöhungswinkel corrected, then he needs only abzudrücken.
'Let us say, it has 543 m measured. "
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting the geschoss on distance 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will shift
The company Fujitsu relocated its establishment in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year will be 400 employees made redundant from the previous office on marienbader place in bad homburg astro in the park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocated its establishment in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
As for the computers and their maintenance specialized branchenriese on Wednesday, in July of next year, 400 women and men work of the office on marienbader place in bad homburg astro park in the evening, this is a great bürokomplex the Lyons street in the Frankfurt borough niederrad.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained in the medium term, there should be a further 100 jobs have to be accommodated, which have been distributed to the region.
The mietangebot is very attractive, moreover, would the großraumbüros astro park in the workings of the staff better.
In bad homburg was only Fujitsu tenants.
The competent managers Bernd Wagner said, "with frankfurt-niederrad we have a central site with excellent infrastructure found."
The excellent links with the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu is of great importance.
The recent removal of a major company within the region, yesterday joy at the winners and disappointment at the losers.
The Frankfurter wirtschaftsdezernent Markus frank (CDU) said, this is a 'global player' has been won.
This was a "great standortbekenntnis'.
Fujitsu passe on the city, the location is an important boost for niederrad.
The bad homburger Mayor Michael korwisi (green) lamented the choice of Fujitsu.
The city is early in the management of the intention has been informed.
"We have, of course, our aid offered to the company," said korwisi.
The friendly contacts would, however, have nothing to do with the difficulties of the computerherstellers with the landlords will of the House on marienbader place can change.
Ultimately have the impetus for economic reasons.
Now is concerned, a lengthy risk in such a prominent place.
I hope that the owners and landlords will of the building is cooperative. "

As a project of the city and a private projektentwicklers arose between station and leaders of a new stadtentree, both because of the massive development of the earlier part of a car park land, as well as the level of buildings for criticism.
In relation to the 2001 anlageberatungs- and ratingunternehmen feri, software-hersteller for reisevertriebssysteme, launch Amadeus, and the associated with Siemens computer manufacturers Fujitsu houses.
The Fujitsu buildings used, in 2006, of the Frankfurt German immobilien-chancen-gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish falcon real estate investments SA in Madrid is sold.
The Tokyo beheimatete fujitsu-konuzern are called the third-biggest it-provider the world.
It is companies, for example, computers and servers prepared and also makes the necessary service.
The establishment of the rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, a much larger employer Fujitsu but in Munich.
From bad homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu technology frankfurt-niederrad solutions in the further subsidiaries of this site to Fujitsu services and a company called TDs.

Amazon freezes servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Amazon has internet-dienstleister enthüllungsplattform of its servers.
There is perhaps a political pressure for the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomaten-depeschen.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposedly in England.
The enthüllungsplattform WikiLeaks device in the United States is increasingly under siege.
The internet-aktivisten lost access to its previous American server and are now seeking a internet-heimat in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, but other countries and companies for the boycott of WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the fahndungslisten by Interpol, after a press in Britain.
'WikiLeaks of amazon-server. "
"free speech in the land of the free ', shared by kurznachrichtendienst enthüllungs-aktivisten Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the dot.com companies in the Amazon wikileaks-dokumente of its servers.
The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen in the Amazon web service (AWS), the high zugriffszahlen on the documents.
By Twitter, WikiLeaks to the step further: 'fine, the dollar will now be spent on people in Europe. "
If Amazon such problem with the speech, "they should cease to sell books."
Amazon have the use of its servers by WikiLeaks halted after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman investigations have reported the television CNN under the office liebermans.
The chairman of the Amazon senatsausschusses in mid-October, with a boycott threatened, told the British 'Guardian'.
"I would have liked this measure in the Amazon is taking in the light of previous publications klassifizierter information by WikiLeaks," said the senator.
Meanwhile, Avigdor Lieberman, called for the platform in other countries to deny the use of servers.
'WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and ruthless approach, our national security is at stake and endangering around the globe life ', it means in a communication of the other independents senator.
"No responsible companies - whether American or foreign--matter - should WikiLeaks in its efforts to help stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, because vergewaltigungsverdachts by the authorities in Sweden, is on the fahndungsliste of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper, the independent "is the 39-year-old Australians in Britain, the exact location is Scotland Yard.
The internet-aktivist the investigations in Sweden as intrigue his opponents.
Wikileaks-sprecher kristinn hrafnsson said in London, there have been threats.
"It was even calls for a killing of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange rightly fear for their safety, said hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, the previous Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the wikileaks-enthüllungen for treason should be prosecuted and executed.
In Canada, a consultant of leader Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange should be killed "and" Obama may have a 'drone'.
Between the White House and Assange today, a battle.
The spokesman of the American president, Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if you had asked for recently estimated spionage-aufforderungen of diplomats.
'I am not quite sure why we view with concern the types of a website, "Gibbs.
"our foreign policy and the interests of that country are far more important than its a website."
The American Government is now protecting their databases extensively to the test.
As the special envoy's vize-direktor of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, telling the White House.
Travers is responsible for 'the necessary structural reforms', the following the publication of the botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks needed.
The White House also want to check the way, as the entire government information and protection.
The American government, moreover, for the safety of dissidents and most ardent concerns of trying to them by the wikileaks-veröffentlichung in jeopardy.
"We have done everything in contact with them to enter," said außenamtssprecher Philip Crowley.
"We are willing to protect them, if that should be necessary."
The eis-universität
In the "gelato university 'in Bologna are better prepared eiskonditoren seasons.
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest rise and visitors from around the world.
What is actually the whole ice?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The German gelatiere, something which is old-fashioned eiskonditor flower after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst.
The gelataio is catching up with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, it abolishes the waffel and sold it.
In order to do this, we must not anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wishes to know more about ice, which is not in the 'gelato-university' of the Italian company carpigiani over.
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machinery across the high Italian ideals.
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest rise and visitors from around the world.
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in hauseigenen eisdiele.
Some of midlife-crisis dreams of a new career, other car is simply the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries, of all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country's industrial ice-cream in future, a European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little own eintüten.
Two young ägypterinnen dream of a eisdiele in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil, the quality of the ice cream in their bars improve - and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because their children Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants, firstly, the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets in his training, but not the icing on the cake of national and even südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät with an electronic programme to 85 degree heated and then immediately to four degrees are cooling.
Then he is at the centre of a Hahn machine, and it is a white, pasteurisierte basiscreme milcheissorten basis for all.
It immediately with questions of lecturer bestürmt: we can only ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can one's own experimentierlust free rein?
Luciano warns that the Zeitgeist to be fooled.
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients' speech, perhaps, nevertheless, stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as guarkernmehl from guarbohne.
Of course, one can ice without stabiliser, but it must then be sold within one day, otherwise sackt it together, and the client bites on louder eiskörnchen.
Certain variations in the grundmasse are permitted.
It is exciting to flavourings.
For the flavour of the EIS Maestro Luciano distinction between the ingredients in the obst-abteilung or in the sweets of the supermarket are buying.
Moreover, there are powder and pasten.
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatised additions."
"but they should simply to experiment."
Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or, indeed, in the ice cream from the White grundmasse with eggs to yellow cream and with kakaopulver on the basis of all possible schokoladen-verführungen.
Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen.
Luciano, you have four different types of vanille- schokolade- mokka- haselnuss-eis, and to establish, with or without eggs in the grundmasse with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also undergo fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; that is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-eis tastes necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The favorite kiwi-eis, the working party, the more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mix will lift the flavour of a gelato right, says Luciano.
Rechenaufgabe eisherstellung is: will pfirsich-püree with sugar used in the sugar grundrezept must be reduced.
For zitroneneis extraportion sugar is a necessary.
Luciano prefers a device, with the sugar content of the intended measure fruchtsorten (winegrowers so that the oechsle in grape musts).
Fortunately, facilitate the rechnerei tables.
To make ice requires not so much physical use as before.
Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture of grundmasse helps.
There is also a device in which the ready-made eis-mischung cremig beaten, and at the same time minustemperaturen kept cool.
Despite all the computerized remain small breakdowns.
The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its kurskollegen from top to bottom with fruchtpüree, as he überdimensionale hand blenders spiral out of control.
At any rate, "says Maestro Luciano," it is only a matter of time before that happens. "
Inspectors in zwielicht
The European food authority is the EFSA with crops experimental industry.
This accusation formulates the expert group testbiotech, as an independent institute for the assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte were for years in lobbyistenverband ilsi under the Treaty.
The will of groups such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper have been instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften for crops and is involved in a clear conflict of interests, then.
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise word for word, with the position papers of the ilsi and deceive the imprint of the industry, in fact, of the Italian Parma will be checked.
It is already the second time that a interessenskollision testbiotech share your criticism.
It is a high-level efsa-managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and that the sides.
The mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) had recently human links between kontrollierender EU authority and lobbies, reveals what umweltbundesamt, as EU parliamentarians sympathetic.
EFSA can, however, see no conflict of interest.
We would like to all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality are, in an opinion.
The experts who work for EFSA, for it is not that they have no contact with the industry.
They should disclose this, however.
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States.
This describes himself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag.
In the matter of independent experts to criticise how then that genetically modified plants are currently without any fütterungsversuch for animals to be authorised and the reaction of crops to nurture, will not be tested.
"We want to know what, for example, of genetically modified maize on the field of power," says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test which no reliable results liefere.
"If the risks, as they should be then? ', then done.
It also envisages Angelika hilbeck.
Since 1994, the academic research in genetic engineering and is currently in the technical university Zurich.
The industry attempts in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more and more critical scientists to affect or to discredit.
There is, therefore, hard researchers, corporations are intertwined.
For companies, critical studies would not usually published.
"the industry to monitor the security research," claims hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli gsell, which concerned, a total of approximately 400 kg.
On Monday evening, he was in Stuttgart, which have station tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed heavily.
It is the same old story: in September, the excavators angerückt and had started a large chunk of the nordflügels break off.
The Stuttgart world was not more of the same: thousands marched against s21 tieferlegung the billions of little station.
When it came to the settlement freeze, there was a large proportion of the wing in ruins.
Shattered in 6,000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has a few scraps.
These obstacles are "reliquien."
"You must not disappear."
He schwärmt: 'a cheap and poor Stein, simple and erdenhaft. "
As he aufsägte, have the following zigarettenqualm gerochen.
What he will do with the scraps, he knows.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones will result in a forest in Tübingen on a former munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel rongen stein-reich has to be built.
The 44-jährige deals with old stones.
He has bought, the demolition in Stuttgart.
It would be a disgrace, you would schotter gemahlen or landfill disappearance, "he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, once a wachhäuschen.
We have named and threatened him, he tells in September in the newspapers that the remnants of the abbruchunternehmer nordflügels bought.
But he has talked with the s-21-gegnern days.
And he has declared that he is now nothing for the demolition.
And if it was happening, then it is the wisest thing if the stones reused.
Around 200 s-21-gegner, as one of the, on average, 80 kilos of serious quader stückpreis 6,50, up to EUR 14.
As a memory, but also in the hope that it will be able to return to a reconstruction.
500 tonnes rongen had bought, 25 large lkw-ladungen.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landschaftsgärtner, häuslebauer.
Everywhere you have weggeschleppt and what boot and supporters were able to bear.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long been in "mäuerle" or limits of kräuterbeeten.
This stone 'actually is nothing special, "says rongen.
"is not the political component."
It is rising in his SUVs, makes a tour by 20 hectares large empire.
In passing, it has studied and terminated later biology, then he is interested in computers and finally steinhändler.
And steinliebhaber.
40000 tonnes of stones stored it.
From Germany karrt its value.
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler the Republic.
It stifles.
In the snow, skilful behauene sandsteine.
"They belonged to Dresden marienbrücke," he told.
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt.
"My lieblingsstein."
This is the way to highly by the forest.
It shows a bunch: red sandstein, formerly part of the Karlsruhe little station.
And further.
Beautiful travertin. "
Once the quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories cannstatter travertin from the Stuttgart, bringing rötlicher stone is complemented with the cathedral, Saint blasien tuff the Heilbronner hospital.
The work of the effort, which sweat.
If rongen to think about how the Stones being used by hand and simple flaschenzügen ochsenkarren budged, and it is quite reverential.
It would be a scandal if it schreddern. "
It is not rich, immensely rich.
However, 14 people employs the steinhändler today, furthermore, the top in the forest steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer settled.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the resteverwerter.
Soon, it needs to Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
If high-potentials talentekampf
There is a flourishing surge on Buffett.
16 students are in order, and lachsbrötchen tomatensuppe trick.
The Technical University braunschweig and the car Volkswagen have designstudenten maschinenbau- and a workshop invited.
In a way ideenwettbewerb should they, together with vw-entwicklern on the car of the future fachsimpeln - and incidentally, Volkswagen.
In the competition for the best brains are now many companies in the nahkampf and how VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the hörsälen to recruit before they enter the job market and others pulled.
And, because the universities no identification of the achievements of their students, they tried to in the ausnahmetalente praxisprojekten erspähen and in itself.
On the second day of the workshops on the Tu braunschweig autokonzern seal of the talents.
A young lady from the human resources departments distributed ball-point pen wine gum and with vw-logo mappen.
It tells the hopeful jungtalenten of praktikumsprogrammen and studentenjobs and show them in the company.
Nico selle of the Tu braunschweig cared for the project with VW.
It envisages the benefits for both sides: 'the students are in contact with the industry and gathering experiences. "
"VW can, at the same time, students, are interesting candidates closer angucken and think about the people."
Such cooperation, as selle, are not unusual.
New is that so aggressively to students gebuhlt.
"otherwise, the focus on the technical project," says selle.
The battle for fresh graduierten will be even harder.
In many sectors, the company's staff is no longer a big band of applicants to choose.
But they must extol and particularly for highly qualified workers balzen.
Especially graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in a strong negotiating position.
According to the association of German engineers vdi remained in October about 40 000 ingenieurstellen unfilled.
And, according to the so-called ingenieurlücke vdi-prognosen widen.
For the wirtschaftsprüfungs- and consultancy KPMG is Roman dykta on talentjagd.
He is organising costly recruiting-events such as the kpmg-race, a kind of modern do, in the light of the participants gps-koordinaten their way.
Eight promising students do so next year across the USA.
Incidentally, the participants kpmg-filialen reputation and the company.
Who should decide with two auswahlrunden in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of many applicants flies in the United States.
The slashing and burning at the high potential of universities, the guns according dykta widening.
"We want to deal with the race from the mass withdrawals."
"just a simple segeltörn was not enough for us."
The bill for talentjäger dykta seems to be working.
"We have until today with all participants in a similar action in the last year in contact."
"Some are nearing completion and will soon apply to us," he says.
In addition to the direct Court on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also quite classic in berufsmessen on revealing clothing prowled.
"We are trying to achieve on fachmessen graduates."
"around the intersolar" sitha stübe personalleiterin reported that the solartechnikhersteller solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about nachwuchsproblematik.
At present, the unternehmenswebsite 35 posts advertised.
"It is very difficult to fill vakante positions."
This costs a great deal of time and money, "she says.
Another way of contact on the uni-professoren.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the university in freiberg.
"The professors are indications that we work placements or write his thesis."
Expensive promotions are the solarspezialisten not needed.
This is the company with other benefits to advertise: personal atmosphere, shallow hierarchies and easy communication.
"This is a großkonzern often do not offer," says personalleiterin stübe.
Money is confined to no longer a key role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld documented in a study of the great place to work institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual bestenliste German employers.
It consulted staff as satisfied with your work and your jobumfeld and look at the framework for the employees.
Personalleiterin stübe hopes of the ranking, combined with the jobsuchenden.
I think that applicants, particularly for external assessments on a potential employers looking, "she says.
Wolf pure kriegler of the German employer branding Academy advising companies, with a long-term strategy is a good reputation as employers want to build.
He advises his customers to greater authenticity.
And this means that according kriegler, especially internal measures.
'the best way, as employer attractive, leads on its own staff, "he says.
In branchenjargon means the internal employer branding, i.e. arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own workforce.
"contented staff are the best ambassadors."
If we refer to its people properly and with the companies, then they would identify by solely to friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"This is like a game of gang," says kriegler.
Obama stops new drilling
Off the coast of Florida us-bundesstaats in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years, there will be no new drilling.
A ban has the government in Washington - and thus their previous plans definitively revoked.
Even before the Atlantic remain for new drilling.
This was Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The catalyst for this strict ban, at least for the next five years is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon bohrplattform "" in April.
Before the accident, which cost the lives of eleven workers and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry has signaled its readiness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates to the extent of US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Who was responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally resolved.
At the heart of the criticism, the British energy company BP, with milliardenforderungen.
A fact-finding mission on behalf of Obama's is, in the course of December 2008 to present its results.
In October, the Interior Minister Ken Salazar after the explosion imposed bohrstopp lifted.
In the end have had several oil companies immediately motions for new bohrvorhaben.
With stringent controls and stricter safety requirements are Obama and Salazar a fresh disaster.
At the moment the competent supervisory authority, the numerous corruption in disrepute, was radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that lucrative tax breaks for the oil and gaskonzerne.
The industry now warns publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be much less than it has been so far.
"The government's plans are the greatest barrier to the growth of the oil and gas industry ', is the result of a current branchenumfrage by the Association of consultants bdo - before the bohrverbot of Wednesday.
The American energy alliance laments the uncertainty in the sector: "nobody knows what the regulation that will change."
Investments in new projects would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
It is burnt Ogoniland
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it looks like the petrol station: billion litres of crude oil have ausgelaufenes nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland destroyed.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen.
Celestine akpobari thinks it well.
"You are not consuming 'reassured the ökoaktivist journalists:" You'll still enough oily slime before the lens wars. "
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, until the chest in water watenden young with around it schlieren abzulichten: regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene almost function.
Under the surface rohölschwaden Brown, is not to be seen.
Once they have gathered here eimerweise prawns, narrates Esther badom on the shores of bodo-jetty-flusses.
Now is the sluggish fluid waters completely dead.
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung quantities of crude oil in the huge river wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo must now six hours row, in order to achieve fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the outer nigerdeltas Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the river realignments criss-crossed mangrovensümpfe the full extent of the devastation prevalent.
Instead of the water wühlt helles brühe motorboot Brown, who in his hand into water POPs, attracting ölige fingers.
The roots of mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the ground, sad I occasionally unbalanced palmen their wedel depend.
Vogelschwärme, as usual, wetlands are meted out: as soon as the außenborder silent, is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise ghastly tranquillity.
'What is happening here is organic warfare, "says celestine akpobari gloomy:" We live in constant danger to health.'
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate.
The area where they live for decades the Ogoni people is a controversial battlefield: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, are organised in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, to its production shell-konzern 1993, whose ölarbeiter because it is too dangerous.
Today the company to return Ogoniland denied: while the entire delta region by the size of Switzerland, with over 5 000 bohrquellen and 7 000 kilometres of pipelines, more than two million barrels of black gold be pumped, the oilfields resume oil operations in Ogoniland, is too unstable to the company of the situation.
Every few hundred metres stählerne gestelle stand out as bizarre sculptures from the water: "christbäumchen 'the heads of the boreholes too zärtlich.
It is up to 50 years old, most of the korrodiert.
Time and again, such a bohrkopf promoting good-quality, thinks, then akpobari rinne a constant stream of crude oil water.
More than two billion litres in 50 years, to estimate the ecosystem of the Delta to materialize: year after year, the quantity of oil in the shipwreck of the supertankers' Exxon Valdez '21 years ago in Alaska entered into the sea, one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Anyone who is in favour of the ongoing öko-gau is to blame, this wrangles.
While the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90% of the pollution, environmentalists and see berstende bohrköpfe lecke pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than else in the world, accusing the us-wissenschaftler Richard Steiner the Corporation in 2008: the rate of defects in the pipes, is many times higher than elsewhere. "
In one place, from afar, ölverschmierte abandoned as a workshop open-air to emerge from the mangroves design: they are splitternackt and up to its neck ölverschmiert.
Among the many casks, partly with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site associated, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie.
This is the barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours fervid, Michael, the leader of the group.
The first is pressing petrol by the pipes in the later spits auffangtopf, at the end of the leadership of kerosene and diesel.
As Michael and produce four employees on a daily basis until four casks diesel à 300 litres: 'This brings us 34.000 naira a "- around 22 dollars.
The use of the chronic deltabewohner treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has a single refinery.
The nearly 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low dieselpreis the illegal kocher still undercut their raw materials, because they have been in vain.
He comes from "bunkerern," which pipelinenetz across Ogoniland tap: this is a country that, according to experts in the whole of the Niger delta on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of crude oil have been lost.
Only a tiny part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material, however, will fill illegally veredelt: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officials belong to oil tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster rather on the population or the lax mode is due to the activist akpobari for purely academic.
The oil companies would not as invaders, and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen are not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries. "
Now is the ratio of the Ogoni, above all, to shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the company in question would be: "Perhaps there are of course other nationalities, such as the Chinese and better."
As Michael nervous.
"high time that it disappears, 'says the muskulöse put.
"every minute can the soldiers."
The illegal ölveredler of the special forces caught, they are not arrests, but a painful bribe.
The mainly from the North Buddhist soldiers want - as all Nigerians - from the raw material benefit.
"This damn stuff, our country in every respect to the dog ', says akpobari.

Thousands of dead mate
More than 10,000 people have been buried in New Zealand, the miners, the following a series of explosions in a mine declared dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the situation in unglücksschacht more precarious.
Barely two weeks ago it was Pike river mine near the town greymouth to a fierce explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years have been days.
A tube was unglücksschacht hinabgelassen, but had no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions were no rescuers attended a meeting for security reasons.
The second fierce blasts, the authorities and experts assumed that there is no chance of survival for the mate more.
The corpses have not been recovered.
Now flash relatives and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people were in radioactive sunshine in greymouth on the New Zealand südinsel.
You remained silent for two minutes.
In honour of the miners were buried 29 tables, where helmets, lamps and the names of the mate to see.
Also, images and personal effects, including surfbretter clothes and, in their place.
The government of the country's flags flying at half mast.

As soon as the explosive gases are supplanted, started the scorching temperatures in the heart of the mine herunterzukühlen, said polizeipräsident Gary knowles to journalists.
To hell, warriors!
The fits splatter kunstkino?
The orchestrator of Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen new.
What audience in the Danish director Nicolas winding refn commemorated, as he "walhalla rising" hawed?
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (mads mikkelsen) freed themselves from his peinigern and, with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents, sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero thuggish tötungsmethoden to serve and its enemies have time gedärme from the vibrant limb, if he has bad humour.
On the other hand, says einauge, as it is called, indeed the whole film is not a word, and also the other characters can at most be time to one or two sentences, or a few painful todesschreien.
Otherwise, silence and the beautiful hügellandschaft geschwelgt gruselig Scotland's wikingerwelt of around a thousand years ago, the scene.
Ideal, rather than adults cineasten with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten.
Well, if a film has several groups, it is a shame that, if they are mutually exclusive.
Director winding refn, since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher 'as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, refuses but stoical, his works with a little more humour mainstream or less brutality the arthouse accessible.
The most likely kunstkino-freunde of around spritzenden gehirnmasse and gedärmen be deterred.
The latest action-fans then die from boredom, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons, with a troupe of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem aufbricht and an eternity in slump and fog trapped, before the team in America, there remains silent.
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising" in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD.
This is particularly important because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because, behind the façade bluttriefenden prätentiösen until a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent offence, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum.
And from which there is no escape for spectators.
Hardly refn off a moment of détente and undertakes him with its icy images and the dark trance-artigen soundtrack very slowly the throat, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him from the heart of the characters runs.
Only a small blonder boy who einauge faithful to the side, preserved something like innocence, all the others will be driven by anger.
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point the warriors from hell, perhaps the ambassadors of the devil itself.
It means ruin, perhaps, but only for the already verdorbenen.
"walhalla rising" is an unexplained film, hate and admire, to annoy, outraged and surprised.
An experience.
Puzzling erdarbeiten
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, but to comment - nor is it controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges buildings in Syria.
It is on the shores of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is dair as-saur.
Your name comes up in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader built hidden in a valley of the electricity.
According to a briefing of us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 is also under the name of the near town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties.
The CIA led a videopräsentation with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern.
By computeranimation blendete it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been a copy of the North Korean model fell from the atomzentrum Yongbyon.
Moreover, it presented photographs, the building of the vicinity or even innenraum.
The reactor is on the verge of operation, it was said, but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was at the puzzle with time, a greater.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria el-kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that the country's nuclear weapons programme 'active'.
Some intelligence officers in Europe are rather more cautious and only talk of a 'alleged reactor', even if the cia-präsentation for 'plausible'.
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
I am sure he was asked as a reactor, replied to have a high un-diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA, "enough material to put questions."
The rubble of the so-called 'dormant militärgebäudes "surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry aside planierten the terrain thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by the people.
Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than the CIA.
These, however, are recordings on the market, because of the unknown client - perhaps Israel - it originates.
The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity is not independent.
Syria has always claimed that never operated a secret nuclear program or a reactor built.
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus.
However, the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures provide.
Moreover, the inspectors denied a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building.
But Israel remains silent pugnaciously.
"We will never comment ', confirmed recently by the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
It perpetuates the investigation of the case since June 2008 fruitless and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ', as a great Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna authorises - after all, it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area of the IAEA.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appear to be three other institutions, the 'functional' in connection with the alleged reactor to - and unlike that still exist.
The inspectors have not disclosed the installations concerned, what role they are or what they seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns.
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and a gebäudekomplex masyaf satellitenbildern to identify, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
It is probably in or immediately, in addition to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria, the IAEA denied access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA from the United States vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment.
Because the nukleardetektive were a recommendation by the US secret services to the attention of the institutions.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the Euphrates material quader hertransportiert back and forth.
A large Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion'.
There is, however, no evidence of sensitive activities', i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing; the processes for the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary.
The type of reactor is with uranium, not enriched.
But where the uranium had should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues, there are only plausible guesswork.
It is also unclear whether debris, the valuable traces of mountains, to the three places stored.
As if the hundreds stands from the ground disappeared, nobody wants to have any information as to where the rubble.
The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salzmine al-tibni, Syria in 1998 to their suitability as centres for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had a recent analysis by satellitenbildern for the prestigious journal Jane's intelligence review with the reactor.
Starting from the orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspicious places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested.
This is a coincidence, but hardly contributed to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, it says in the IAEA diplomats, have spent many months, a plan for inspections to develop that Syria should allow any military secrets to preserve the burden alone shows how great the interests of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal.
Western diplomats had in Vienna a year ago have been allayed, the reactor is destroyed, therefore, the matter is not high urgency, around US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' sonder-inspektionen, one of the principal means of the Vienna atombehörde to controls.
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future ', but then it is dragging its feet.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority of the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to remember: 'what is, if you will, in the end, nothing at all? "
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer, with the work on its still nameless regiedebüt has started, there will be trouble.
The script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We know a lot more about it, but that is not enough for anxiety.
There is a persistent rumour, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some in Sarajevo planned drehtage short term, Hungary has planted.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary and the marginalised postproduktion, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic of the organisation of female casualties wrote about the UNHCR un-flüchtlingshilfswerk Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, has a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie itself is Ambassador of un-flüchtlingshilfswerks.
Diplomatically, it is not the women - it has been a few weeks ago, a meeting in Hungary, which offered, however.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so hasecic.
In vergewaltigungscamps liebesgeschichten have not, and Jolie attitude towards the victims quote her enough on the script.
The organisation has recommended that, according to the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk Jolie as Ambassador, reported to dismiss the guardian.
What, exactly, but has Jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian Ministry, to read the script, has for some and a drehgenehmigung granted for Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie then, however, nothing happened.
The jungautorin even claimed that they have no political intentions with their film, with great difficulty in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated, if the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
The content, however, remains vague.
So circulating a second synopsis of the film in the network, which sounds quite different: the loving knew it before war and take more than a Bosnian Muslim, in one becomes Serbian camp being hijacked in which it operates as a guard.
What is quite different from what sounds as the variant "verknallt rape in folterknecht."
That Jolie film in the war begins - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, as Jolie, is unfair and is based on misinformation. "
Now, it is only the hackers of Hollywood peace: by giving the script, as so many before illegally on the web.

By 2015, they even with 200 000 emigrants.
For a small country with just 4.5 million inhabitants, a severe loss.
Hold the forecasts, there is an auswanderungswelle comparable with those in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery for the Irish wealth has now once again makes tristesse wide-ranging.
The economic crisis; in particular the young, well-educated Irish, for which there has to date been uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline in the boom seemed absurd.
Everyone was needed, money was available in abundance.
Meanwhile, however, are three of the ten men and women under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times abound leserbriefe young emigrants, the complaints: 'everything is in Ireland crashed. "
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers, but who can, and our country will lose a whole generation."

The routine demokatrische
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than that of the United States.
This outcome was latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and exclusively in the economist has been published.
Since 1995, this survey is being carried out regularly and shows the meinungswechsel in this region.
Two facts in the poll in September and October of this year, particularly in the eye.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries of the South American pazifikküste the democratic movement has risen sharply (S. table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002, at around 6% a year, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp drop in the last year recovers, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. graph 2).
Around 44% of the respondents said that the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied, as much as in the last year, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values are identical to those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts to bring about more democracy.
This also during the Great Depression, thanks is probably due to the fact that the countries of Latin America are only a brief recession, and a speedy recovery.
In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz absorbed.
(according to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, 2009, the level of poverty in Latin America only slightly, and again this year at 32%.)
But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is not the case.
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a greater problem than unemployment (S. graph 5).
Some 31% say that they either myself or a family in the last year have been victims of crime, but to 38% in the last year, values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy: approximately 71% of the respondents überregional stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007, there were 56% (S. graph 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy your country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized.
Brazil has, according to 19% of respondents (18% in the last year the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see in the United States is the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be accepted.
A '
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts surpassing the fears of the voters, the ill-fated country who rushed to the aid.
Overcrowded polls, several votes cast, in rinnstein ballot papers, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem.
With stundenlanger polling stations opened late.
Many Haitians, many of whom the earthquake in January were displaced streiften wandering in search of a choice.
Some, finally.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged pioneers, because of alleged fraud in the lifting of the results.
Throughout the country, there was some violent protests.
Nevertheless, Mr Edmond mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election as well in many contexts. "
According to a cautious statement of observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, as seriously as they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidates, Jew célestin, is obliged, the preliminary results on 7 December.
The anticipated run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidate, Mr Michel, and the former rap-musiker martelly first-lady mirlande manigat have their initial ungültigkeitsklage withdrawn.
If Jew célestin that the voters have little or no approval of the wahlberhörde the winner of the run-off declared, this could lead to problems.
As a result of the epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, there was a low turnout feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians through lack of organisation in the vote.
Shortly before wahlbeginn were approximately 250,000 cards, the choice will be needed, not yet been distributed.
There is a great deal at stake.
Donors see a legitimate government, recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
In the middle of the sly
In the weeks after the sudden death of their man, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy which their beliebtheitsrate 20 points over 50%, which is the highest value since its election in 2007.
Whether it is in the next year to a re-election gets depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband, your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife, the economic policy was often budgets in the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation is not fully into account.
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen as it sees fit.
On paper, the fernández-regierung last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian, another face, and the Government of the bribery accused), the Congress, the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," the President.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which makes the President more opportunity to spend money as it sees fit.
The economy is overheating, it is likely that this year by up to 9% increase.
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and moderation of the trade unions - are the figure of nearly 30%.
Kirchner, the 2003 the premiership, as Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its primary objectives, and not the inflationssenkung.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for statistics and census indec, prompting the official inflationsstatistiken schönte.
Mr Fernández, now we can follow?
It is the private sector and the trade union leader to discussions.
And official statements that wage increases in the next year to 18%.
The high prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy.
But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps, Cristina Fernández for this reason, Argentina and back to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former restructuring of the country in 2001.
Now it seems that Fernández to an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes around $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, been rejected.
But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado boudou aware that the fund in the drawing up of a new national consumer price index "technical support '. It looks as if this were to be the first step towards the cleaning up of the indec.
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support of your husband politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely the kirchnerismus enough.
If the Argentines from their summer holiday back in March, the wave of sympatie it was shown to be fizzled.
If you want to win another election, it must decide whether it many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are becoming a closer link with the continent.
What does Taiwan of its big brother across the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, in the five city mayors and councillors. This is as broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of cutting-edge business contacts, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy, the relationship with the Chinese Motherland, for the first time since 1949 sustainably changed.
Ma has the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party was split (KMT), three of the five mayors, it received a majority.
Instead, the democratic fortschrittspartei (DPP), the greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have for Ma problems.
Since his election in two years, indeed, his party at around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in the councillors.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries, with krawallmachern flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and rarely active dancers.
There were even compulsory, mysterious mordversuch.
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT, on the eve of the election of a speech on a kmt-kandidaten,
As a man from the amount in the face of fold. LIEN was wounded and killed umstehender viewers.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack tsai ing-wen according to the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, as the KMT has benefited more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not discussed.
Instead, the candidates are debated on plans to housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's militärbedrohung.
This is why the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing to the fore.
But this time, avoiding the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
You responded to this new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives to attract the Community.
China sent a negotiator in Taipei, at a summit on investment and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants a political integration, but the most important first.
We therefore prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP is now reinvented.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: the former leaders of Chen Shui-bian sat for corruption in prison.
During its Presidency, between 2000 and 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence.
But under tais reign spans a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is grappling with the voices of the professionals and the young.
Tsai found as a candidate of the DPP consensus as Su tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is doing everything to show that it is capable of close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion.
Tsai stated publicly that your party is a trustworthy "alternative" to offer MAS vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very annoyed about this change.
From his he declared that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence.
He urged the pragmatists Su even, to run for president.
Even without Chen's interference is the DPP, their potential candidates.
The KMT will of their own selbstanalyse must undergo.
MAS values are poor, in spite of rapid economic growth; kmt-kandidaten wanted their campaign without it.
The main reasons for his unpopularity, unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to one kmt-sprechers it will be cabinet and the local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement, limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnists, "there is no going back."

Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere, facilitate
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including of arsenic can live, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere.
Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth, is it your view, a sign that a life without hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible.
This body has two options. "
"it needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
This makes it a very particular, although it is almost a form of 'alien' way of life ', said Paul c.w. Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science.
Six main elements have been regarded as essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists herausfanden, increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further, if it has been replaced by arsenic.
"one wonders what else is still possible," said the co-autor of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in seeking außerirdischem life, as scientists life and its forms must recognise, as Anbar.
The report deals with microbes on earth have been found.
The announcement of a press conference, with no details of the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, the report by the discovery außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery 'shows that in other planetensystemen organisms, with the help of other elements of biochemical processes in motion and that the' standardelemente ', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily firmly indicated, "declared Charles cockell, Professor on planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the teams.
This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemischen processes and structures element by another cannot be replaced ', added cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
The Institute Felisa wolfe-simon astrobiologischen NASA, the study launched, the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, possibly a element by the other can replace.
"arsens is based, in particular, were aware of the fact that it is chemically a similar situation as phosphorus."
"It is the organisms, an element of other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic differently as phosphorus. It into our biochemisches system, where almost all verschmiert," says Anbar.
The researchers, the Bacillus gfaj-1 rising arsenkonzentration. It suited to and grew.
The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that it is also in arsenic can survive shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can occur, either on the ground or another planet or the moon, the arsenic frequency.
According to Jamie S., Mrs Foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more, she says, therefore, the science assumed that early life there have been used.
"There is reason to believe that life is also differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, Member States wolfe-simons forschungsteam.
The research from NASA and the Department of Energy and the national health authorities.

Tech toys keeps geschenkebudget balance
This year's favourite among the gifts is iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft kinect videokonsole. Both games can be a significant hole in their geschenkebudget.
A iPad costs as much as five bmx-räder for $99, while the price of a kinect-spiel approximately 10 classic springseilen or about 48 doses play-doh.
But they can protect their geschenkebudget.

I was immediately clear that Moore's law came into force this year was the technologiespielzeuge vibrant and cost at the same time a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with its own website, will take place on the best-known of this type, and club webkinz Penguin a wider supply.
There are more and more knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare akkus.

In China deploys soft
As a ausbildungsoffizier step Tang shenbin on an urban space, the revised its jittery subordinates and issued with military authority and orders gedämpfter voice.
He wanted his female members of China's robust chengguan - of urban policy, feared and contempt for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - the viewers.

Four pairs of black pumps had gerader number.
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften destroy proprietary hair.

In mittel-china wuhan replaced violence by niederstarren: 2009 umkreisten reportedly 50 officials have a properly established imbisswagen and gaze at the operators, and this after half an hour einpackte and left the room.
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women to strengthen the urban polizeistreifen. They were specific due to their appearance, a figure and their youth.
It is a softer, crude police femininen aspect.
Unfortunately, however, it would also be very difficult scarlett johansson, the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos to improve.
Quite rightly, the critics.
Unlike the police, must these officials the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely a different picture.
In January 2008, beat officials in the province authorized a spectator to death, as this with his mobile phone, filming, as a protest against a dustbin still.
Last year was a schulungshandbuch the Beijing officials stolen and published on the Internet, described as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.

Zheng lihua, deputy head of the municipality of distrikts this description, would not agree
But made to that in China größenvorgaben advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to steady gesichtszüge.
Whether it is in good shape, in China is controversial.
But people with disabilities or physical plunder do not have to apply.

It is not a sexist empfindetes that such great store by your appearance.
"you, I see this uniform sexy?" asks them with ironischem glance.
Your colleague with grübchen that 21-jährige Xu Yang, comments, "we have the task, the image of the city to represent."
You say that you regret the brief attitude is not, as it could have been more ambitious karrierepläne than simply by the alleys scheuchen traders to them on business.
Every morning deals with the some remarks about twelve straßenhändler trying to foot or bicycle as many rolls and to sell tofugerichte before they fortgejagt.
'Mr Wang, it would disappear. "
"We have already said so often," frl. Xu a trader who fled his foot was on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche temporarily in the lurch.
According to the officials is the activity more monotonous than troublesome.
"It is almost every day, the same," says Huang Jing, 20 in leisure vertriebswesen studied.
'Everything routine. "
One reason for this is that the female officials were not the traders, as their male colleagues, must confiscate.
You can only threaten offenders, their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility officials in China, which often are exposed.
This year, hundreds of people rioted outside, Kunming,, the capital of the province of Yunnan after the rumour chengguan-beamte stock-market boom, have killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and chenguan-beamte have been violated in the nightly incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge upset or have been set on fire.
Xindu remained of such violent incidents have been spared.
But riots are not carried out.
Only two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz the female officials this morning patroulierten, over 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated, which is contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a workshop has been repaired.
The owner cried screamed blue murder.
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with cruel face the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, remained. It was his White namensschild, to remain anonymous.
As your colleagues the coordinators - men over 40 - a supporting role.
But they have not been trained, a clean image.
"We are sometimes verbally."
"but sometimes also physically," says Mr Li well-balanced.
Most of the time, 'people are with the dispute. "
Public Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors, the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign of the accusations acquitted, the following his affaire with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband a lobby, against him, gave the lawyers of Senator on Wednesday.
This decision concludes the worst rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign, the Republicans from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide for headlines, and his career a drubbing placed, it was as a potential candidate for President of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator ensigns bekanntgab office, he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation 'delighted'.
The ethikkomitee of the Senate, however, could impose a disziplarstrafe.
According to the ensigns lawyers, the Ministry of informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been cancelled and that in this matter any further accusations.
The Justice Ministry was not the case.
The judgment was for many ethik-anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice, a surprise that they think there is sufficient evidence that the lobbying-verbot Ensign has disregarded.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents which, for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times were disclosed, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his voters to lucrative contracts that gave his silence on affaire wife with hamptons Cynthia to buy.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign ensigns as treasurer.
Ensign, contact some political friends to Hampton work according to the documents and interrogation took it to you after the recruitment hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam, it was allowed to it for a year is no lobbying for his former employer or the whole of the Senate.
According to a statement by ethik-experten contravened the unusual agreements between Ensign and Hampton, from affaire close friend, against the so-called prohibition of drehtür-lobbykratie.
According to the evidence, "it is apparently a consultation and the violation of the drehtür-statuten," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, which is based on the defence of clients specialising in the sights of the government.
During the Justice Ministry officially rejected, the reasons for the decision on ensign-fall to announce, said Mr. fire and other ethikanwälten, the Ministry seem to be very careful in political indictments following a multitude of defeats, of the media with great interest, including the decision last year, the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor.
Prosecutors' are obviously schreckhaft, "said Melanie sloan, the leader of the Association of 'citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington' (an organisation whose objective is to combat corruption in parliamentary and governmental circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr Ensign brought before the courts.
This means in principle that hochstehende officials now assume that the laws are not apply to you, "adding it.
Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday a public prosecutor, and another on the next day, in which he has been told that the Ministry of any complaints against his clients will rise.
Mr. ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday once again reiterated that 'in accordance with the law ."
Mr. coggins refused, the legal arguments he put forward towards the public prosecutors, to explain.
"I do not, in the gesprächsdetails between the Ministry and me. Only so much is said, we believe that the right decision to have," he said.
Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigations of a separate complaint by the ethics committee, the payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against bundeswahlgesetz breached.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is something other than a gift.
NV energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time, Senator, was one of the firms, in which Mr Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after the company as a lobbyist dissuading Mr. Hampton, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, had a meeting with Mr. Hampton, in which he stated that he is a matter for the Ministry of the Interior "anklopfe '.
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the Transport Ministers, a meeting in the name of the company, after they had ceased to Mr. Hampton lobbying.
As last year, for the first time, information on this affair to the public, to apologize to Mr. Ensign in his electorate and gave his position in the Senate, where it is in the order of precedence of Republicans fourthly, have been.
After many months was not noticed, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago told reporters that he would like to see a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer the objective of police investigations, declared his pressesprecherin, Jennifer Cooper, Senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigation einstelle.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada continue," she said.
Twitter carefully cheshire-berufung power
A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
In minutentakt verschickten them on their reports on Twitter grausige testimonies.
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140, 000 twitter-meldungen on the process of rape and beds gekettete children in a House that go up in flames.
On Thursday will be closely followed the process of Steven J. Hayes, was accused of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed, to have a formal end to the judgment on the death sentence, the panel has said.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in court, the reasons for appeal to explain and the courts in years to come.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - a "zirkusatmosphäre 'and a widespread, instant penetration aufrührerischer details have been so that the jury improperly influenced by the public indignation.
This protest could induce appelationsgerichte with the issue of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom necessary.
'I have seen during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial influences, "said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger.
The presiding judge, Jon C. blue from the Supreme kammergericht, last week the applications by decision succinct and, when he said that the new media "carefully controlled ', and that there is no proof that the jury of passions driven.
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades gerichtseinsprüche stated that the coverage of famous cases doubts about the fairness of a process gives rise.
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland, his wife have killed, lifted and stated in its decision that, given the new media "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom '.
Some people think that the long-running and spielfilm 'on the flight' in this crime is based.
Some lawyers say gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary in order to ensure that the channels from the courtroom at the time of the case of Dr sheppard were inconceivable.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in processes of the general public are persecuted, to be anxious," said John J. donohue III, professor at Stanford law school, the death penalty has investigated in Connecticut. His report, they will be arbitrarily imposed.
Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an instant communications from the courtroom, could the processes of fair.
The twitter-angelegenheit is just one of the many lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain for years to discuss, and thus a condemnation to delay.
The defender of claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes already have these could be as judges blue not to allow them to the reactions of potential judges to test, by offering them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed.
Some of the judges have said, photographs of victims Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust.
The lawyers say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution in question, and argue that the judges are falsely exchanged a jury, a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that it is improperly exerted pressure on the judgment than the unusual decision was made, the panel on the weekend freely.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments on the impact of extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a urteilsanfechtung that you have submitted last month, it is clear that the case of the news in Connecticut had dominated and during the campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate of the candidates have been debated.
They argued that the new media continuously the flames of the emotions of the case reopened.
"such a day-to-day surge of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "we have previously in new haven and perhaps even nationally or not."
Its focus on the reporting of Twitter is controversial.
In interviews said some journalists that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist than reports, the slower to be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view, the reporting of future processes verarme.
But some lawyers said appelationsgerichte would often with the argument, social and technical changes requires the adaptation through the courts.
Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In its objection they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the sentencing of Dr sheppard because the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"this case," wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can combine the divisive courtesy?
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativity is this week little courtesy in Washington has erupted.
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital return?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of the Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government's policy in which any decision to be taken to deal with.
After all, what we hear that it has not been a polite debate between two different sides of a further consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan punktesammelns.
The public meetings of the deficit Commission of Presidents on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months of mutual respect, the emergence of the ideological divide, which continues to the Members divides, concealed.
It is not enough to say that it is a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a trial - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while claiming even tried to the limitations of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too low, and that there is a rapid change in the atmosphere in the last two years, might be dominated.
Regardless of whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed.
There is no question, the tone has changed, "said pete wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, which is now for the 'ethics and public policy center."
"that is after elections inevitable.
Elections give partisan passions, die.
And that is a good thing. "
In some areas, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the 'lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts ends at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all of them, be it temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" some session and, at the same time, the New START Treaty, cannot ratify.
But William glaston the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'is not necessarily a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead, if the new 112. Congress convened in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"after the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in confrontation reversal," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I see much of what is happening today in 2012, as a vorkampf or further shadow boxing, for the hauptereignis from 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern their education served.
As concerns the Republican leaders, it may be that you too high poker, you know that you must try to their promise to reduce government spending and health-care reform, to be respected.
These parteilinien are already in the initial reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the increase in the retirement age and the lowering of spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in accordance with its own assessments, pushed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and you are fighting, even in the vicinity of this figure.
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget, the taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of more zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together.
If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both sides must be prudent to the public reaction.
Whoever sentenced to lose, will change tack and the compromise must seek.
This may, in fact, an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the mid-1990's, and they seem more ideological gap between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice to 2012.
So it may be the courtesy of this week on the display of many Americans will be welcomed.
But it will on both sides much more effort requires a common denominator in the questions, the two are still separated.
Durchgesickertes us-dokument portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption
The monitoring of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are part of the bribes and the schutzgeldes they einsammelt, the Kremlin continues. As reported in February the American embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the high staatssicherheitsdienst blackmail unfortunately so that they can keep expensive living standards in Moscow.
They collect money not only of legitimate business, but also of organised criminal gangs.
Every stratum of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as' vertical 'authority' - takes its part of the money that the head upwards.
The memo that under the name of Ambassador John beyrle in Washington on Tuesday, has been clouded by WikiLeaks published on its website.
The memo is based on sources, whose names were redigiert.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
It was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that, in the meantime, been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena baturina, a well-known construction company has, over the years repeatedly rejected charges, and it has many verleumdungsklagen against such accusations.
In September, he declared a Russian television station, when he was asked to documentation, which suggests that it is corrupt: 'It is crazy, it is bad way, it is dirty. "
. An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupted. The surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the report by the ambassador, individuals are listed, and it is unheard, that a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with crime has led to some of you, as a 'disrupted' and to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat as a government," the memo.
"criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a word from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protect) on the police, the state security corps (FSB), the dienstaufsichtsbehörde (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor also covers the entire Moscow regierungsbürokratie.
Professionals have dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
The 'least consequences ordinären criminal and criminal inspectors at the bottom. "
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because it offers no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms from small businessmen and the police arrested.
One source, that is to say, "declared that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is best to protect the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), because it is not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs no longer needed as before '.
The memo noted that, while the collection of funds is comprehensive, protecting itself to be a very modest; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay their business, find very quickly - on the basis of one or other vorwands.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken to combat corruption, but at the same time, has said that he has made little progress.
The message of the memo contains descriptions of men, with suitcases full of money, probably in the Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption must leave Medvedev on the bureaucrats," said finds satarov, the director of Moscow by a committee of experts in a recent interview.
'But he is part of this bureaucracy. "
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, by costing the corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is in seat 154, a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence internationally (countries' least corrupt "to" the most corrupt ').
The revelation of the memos the American embassy, what happened in Moscow time evening will certainly displeasure within the Russian Government, although, as Luzhkov for the mistake of Moscow, it can be blamed for the Kremlin, could be a way to claim that it will resolve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a counterfeiting and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats Batman him and Medvedev Robin mentioned.
The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of domestic policy in this country, "he said.
"But, to be quite honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such pressure and so unethical way, as you well know."
The Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a weak pointed betonierten klassenraum with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong veng high school of the man, it has built in the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader, and he has focussed its people," said sreng KOR Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as the "schlachter" remains the commander in this remote former Rouge rouge-hochburg popular in the north-west of Cambodia, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longstanding supporters in anlong veng challenged.
In April, a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people once the regime.
In June, the government has circulated a passed official examinations for the first time children of former soldiers of the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia, for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, when the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centres, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, aggravated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia.
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said chhang youk, the head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation that regime.
'for them, life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. "
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people have been executed or they died of diseases, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese and 1979 invaded the pole pot-ied Government underwent fled the leftovers of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
This widespread until December 1998, when the final movement kapitulierte, unrest.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla warfare of its basis in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation anlong veng.
But the mid-1990's, when the UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 the first democratic elections in the country, began large groups of the Khmer Rouge fighters, the Government is urged to kapitulationen of Ieng Sary 1996 and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
In 1998, Pol Pot died a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded in 1999 of government in the mountain dangrek arrested.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh, where he was on his trial.
As their patrons they are no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgia.
Even if a few elitist official of the Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten retained because their weapons niederlegten, the poor, uneducated farmers.
"they have very little of the capitulation benefited," said Sok leang by the Center for justice and reconciliation, in Cambodia, in anlong veng, public forums,
"You are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime '.
"they grew without any berufswissen."
Sor Lim, 55 years, in 1974, a teenager of rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle at anlang veng before 1998 niederließ to live as poor reisbauer.
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok everyone has something to eat."
But it is now, because we are looking after our own. "
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raises concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, brought to justice.
The remit of the Court, it is the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not at all clear whether it is on these four cases further action.
It has done little to the anxieties in anlong veng.
Current media speculation, in chaem, 64 years, during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's distriktchefin manteay meanchey in the province.
In 2007, the representative of the documentation centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma dam, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern presumably died.
On a hot night chaem came from the work in the fields on her holzhaus a dirty roads outside anlong veng.
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass, rejected in chaem, about their past the Khmer Rouge to discuss.
Should the Court vorladen, it would refuse to go, she said.
Cambodia is living in peace and stability, "she said.
"There would be no persecution, would be war."
Prime Minister, Hun Sen, 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, the Court more suspicious, even though experts and historians to discuss this.
Cambodia must dig a hole and disregard the past, "he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to go forward, said chhang youk from dokumentationszentrum.
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means gathering of the pieces," he said.
"It is our duty, this broken parts together, so that everything can understand."
The Centre has created the first of the government approved passed official examinations of the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of a democratic Cambodia."
It has circulated the book in June in anlong veng annexed to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education, less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As so often in Cambodia know young people in anlong veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student of the anlong veng high school, said that the new passed official examinations students will be an important part of its history.
But his parents were sceptical, the book home, to read.
"My family rejected many parts of the book, and the Court," he said.
"You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the Court of Justice '.
One such resistance to the process of reconciliation is complex and complicated, said Sok leang.
But the public forums, which passed official examinations and the Court gradually gain influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction.
In the mountains, of dangrek sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter way to a rechteck of black soot, covered with a rostigen blechdach.

"but he has a strong spirit and many people go to him to worship," she said.
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place, where a Bush to mature bananas, in the hope that their luck.
Belarus is in agreement, not to accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that they no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a joint statement following a meeting with the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels.
The US Government has for years sought Belarus to persuade, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and last spring seemed a barrier.
But official of the US administration told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreement with Belarus have been taken 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt.
This was the platform for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue of anonymous, roughly £500.
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear summit on security of 47 nations' in April, the Belarus had excluded.
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit of 2012.
'I was truly thrilled about the fact that it has a seat in the nuclear summit on security (2012). "
'This shows me that it works, "said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called it "a very significant step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years precarious nuclear material.
Since the US administration has six countries helped their highly enriched uranium to get rid of.
Belarus is the seventh.
A dozen countries did under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear summit on security, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never abandon their uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our resource... we will not derive dirty bombs and we will not sell."
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, as there is interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte.
The first round of the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily verstrahlt say official.
It was a spezialzug load, the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for the storage and disposal of, say, official.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the official by plane.
The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which will not be used for nuclear weapons.
'this was extremely careful and coordinated in order to build confidence "to the agreement which has been signed by President Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the department, the global gefahrenreduzierung works.
The James Martin centre for nichtweiterzugebende Studies calculates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is, according to the joint agreement camp in 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States for years been tense, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh respect for human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
"the progress of this global security welcome heißend, the United States of America and Belarus known that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," says it.
No objections to the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-qaida-gefangenen on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as from a telegram of the Ambassador of u.s.a. in Madrid.
This reflects the WikiLeaks enhüllten and the newspaper 'El País' (via cable) relayed documents. It is added that the former deputy head of María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed, "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft overflying Spain, adequately monitored."

The ambassador has expressed its concern about the way in which the PP in this matter.
"despite the generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that the PP will no doubt that an indication that the government Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be construed as a possible human rights violations are tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital, even if these revelations negatively on the Government of the United States may have," stresses.

People's Party won seats in the Congress, 4 and 9 PSC lost
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the towns of Lérida, Tarragona and play a crucial role in Barcelona.
After the major stimmen- abgeordnetenzuwachs in the recent local elections and the PP are looking forward to the parliamentary elections - or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the votes, this party in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
So, the Catalan people's party 610.473 vote in the parliamentary elections of 2008, during this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud.
Last Sunday reached the PPC 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - outcome of the diversion cut rich-country voting shares at the PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP - should continue to forecast the analysts of the PP that, in the parliamentary elections, the PPC from 8 to 12 Members could climb, while also ciu four (it now has 10) before and the PSC at least 9 members (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the European People's Party would lose the ERC a Member - currently has three - while icv keep their members or before.
However, the wahlkalender should be maintained, and the next deadline with the local elections in May 2011, then the People's Party (PP) the voice of the scales, the Socialist domination to an end, and in four provinzhauptstädten and with its majority in the city emblematic, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC the towns of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists will not achieve a majority on its traditional allies (ERC) and icv can to lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party their representation in the town councillor emblematic in which they reach 5% of the votes, will lose.
The PP, on the other hand, an increase in their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and would be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the protagonist in tarragonas shift to play where they had before the current mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros, together with the PP governed.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC the mayors, àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign met it on several occasions.
In other important areas, such as, for example, or reus badalona castelldefels the People's Party a significant growth.
Currently, the PP represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three other in Thailand
The seven of the policemen of the police arrested geheimdienststelle emblematic Pakistanis and the Nigerians, of Thailand managed dschihadistische cell, the different Al qaida-gruppen, including the 'movement for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "laschkar e-Taiba" (let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior, these investigations, is of great importance, so far is that he assured us, with the "operation kampai 'is the Al qaidas fälschungsapparat the" weakened "and" thus their ability to act'.
Researchers assume that in the two years that the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports have been sent to Thailand, where these counterfeited and subsequently to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, were sent out, so that their "fighters" with impunity the limits of European and other Western countries exceed.
The pertaining to cell is not the only one of the jihadi network, which has been active in Europe, except the Thai investigative bodies other European police forces to the investigations. It is not unlikely that in the area of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks such as that last Tuesday in Barcelona has been carried out.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Khan, saddique begum tanveer arshad and the Nigerians babatunde agunbiade were arrested in Thailand) was a further, with the Pakistanis Muhammad athar flounder and zeeshan Ehsan flounder and thailänder sirikanlaya kijbumrung have been arrested.
They had of Bangkok from those in Spain and other European countries established cell.
The Catalan network - part of which was in 2009, been dashed, steel, especially tourists, passports, in accordance with the provisions of the so-called 'international Islamist Front. "
This means that the documents on the name of men under the age of 25 to 45 years be issued and several years had to be valid; they were not visastempel.
In untersuchungskreisen underlines that, until now, no links between the detainees in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay shown to have, although the author of this attack, "laschkar e-Taiba" was to draw up the stolen in Spain and then in Thailand fake passports.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from using a geldtransfer-unternehmens several thousand dollars were sent in the purchase of prepaid-karten for mobile phones, "" have been invested later by the members of the "commandos," the lives of 106 people, an end to them have been used.
The police have comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement of MAs
The chairman of the PPC alicia sánchez-camacho, yesterday, took the opportunity, artur MAS personally their conditions to support his first day as Prime Minister of the proposed; these are no different from the already raised during the election campaign and the primacy of economic recovery and the refrain of regionalist unabhängigkeitsabenteuern, as a finanzausgleichsvereinbarung the regionalistische leaders at the height of its mandate wishes to propose to summarise.
The chairman of the Catalan people's party implemented with the security artur MAS, the 18 MEPs awarded it last Sunday won - a paragraph, which is more than sufficient, indispensable. Since the candidate of the bürgerlich-regionalistischen party ciu relies on at least one of the opposition parties during the vote, when he took up office in the vote.
The future alliances, the regionalists in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress intend to depend on a possible Entente with the PP. The talks MAS at the time with the other parties will, however, Catalonia.
As the leader of the PPC, it calls for this, to support the first day of 'all discourses of the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia concern', as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - as happens in the Basque country - and the leader of ciu even a referendum to subjugate the back.
Two political leaders have in common is that they are the oversized political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and the level of inheritance and geschenksteuer wish to abolish.
With the details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mr Mas are part of the PPC Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat.
Mr Mas has already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - of a tough opposition announced - and Joan Herrera (icv). Today, with Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan laporta (solidaritat catalana).
The altenpflegeheim reaffirms that the deaths on "are due to a lack of measures"
The owners of the altenheims in olot does not preclude their carers on eleven older people
The officials of the La caritat altenpflegeheims olot (Gerona), in a press conference yesterday, as you pointed out, what harm the criminal acts Joan Vila dilmés - the carers, during its work at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, was killed on the establishment.
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, in the company of his lawyer, Joan cañada, tried to and announced, "la caritat would like the leaders (for the deaths) indictments', but 'the right and our accountability to compel us to the process and the civil liability'.
The establishment must not only a social being discredited, because they accept the criminal acts of pflegers not identified in good time, but now also allowed a large numbers of the rechtsvertretern the families of the victims is measured.
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crimes in August 2009 and that it continues to have been murdered.
The judges ordered the fate through the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the altenpflegeheims - because it is suspected that no doctor, the deceased personally have investigated the formalities, but because of their age and diseases by telephone.
The head of La caritat verneinte this point flatly and stated that 'lack of measures keinerzeit the reason for the incidents may have been. "
The lawyer of La caritat added that there was no evidence 'in the case of negligent acts of a person as the accused. "
As a "Angel of death 'getaufte acknowledged the day before yesterday, eleven murders and stated that the first crimes on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he makes a combination of different sedatives.
The head of La caritat declared that the access of staff to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulinspritzen and beruhigungsmittelcocktail the carers in six of the nine crimes to the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests will tell whether Vila is lying and for its first victims of a less cruel death, or whether it is these internally ausbrannte bleichlauge by giving you mention, as he is, according to the confession in three women had done, between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat listens to the statements of the pflegers not believe that not even the number of gestandenen murders, which may well be more. This attitude is justifiable that Vila very different statements before the Court had been made and there is no point in making its approach after eight successful murders suddenly change.
You say that you asked you, therefore, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
To kowtow to the European Central Bank (ECB)
Yesterday, the investors have responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President, Mr Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to react."
The risk premia of euro-peripheriländer are increased dramatically and the stocks of European banks by more than 5%.
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB fooled can hardly points and the euro, which causes for concern, not to be underestimated.
The events of yesterday are typical of a illiquid market, to the extent that it breaks down are recovered, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose its fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank that our liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, whereby the ECB tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, taking a step backwards.
The Bundesbank, which must plan for the purchase of public debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen, it should only einwöchiger permanent access to be maintained.
The irland-krise, we expect the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March 'extended and the quarterly tenders with unbegrenztem access on quartalsende to ensure the liquidity at least until June to be maintained.
We hope, too, that the programme to purchase bonds to be continued and a stärkendes signal will be spent.
If the expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday are discarded and if halstarrig insistence that we can only withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, God help us!
Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May, when the Bank affirmed that the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to take account of the markets and subsequently collapsed, this history tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persevere.
In May, showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said, much has bought, to have a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year staatstiteln in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management were only 500 million 5,28%, compared to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates fell in Portugal by 30 basis points in the whole of the curve and reflected a wahrnehmungsveränderung the markets after the words of Trichet's.
In Ireland, the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied and Bank of Ireland.
The amount to about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000 valued. There are time until February, in order to raise private capital or these banks are nationalised.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests are not recognised in July, the figures in the context of the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government next Tuesday the parliamentary assent to the new budget. As they still do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has its discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, moderate. There is political unity is needed, in order to demonstrate that we jointly play the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish regierungspräsident yesterday the action plan, the Friday to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as the financial institutions, the dismantling of the staatsdefizits, liberalisation, privatisation and creation measures in the ears of investors as vivaldis four seasons.
The sabbatical year Zapatero and Mr Trichet, explains why the Spanish stock exchange by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European markets.
In comparison with the February was the response of the government and of the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing, and we benefit from a surprise result.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year bond, which might the benefits from trichet-effekt. That is why we are placing a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit eliminate.
For Spain, the application of a self-sacrifice hilfsplans.
We would receive liquidity, which we need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March, the interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets without any notice would be closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should meet the motto Caesar's wife: 'now includes not only that, but appearances. "
Only courage that we create.

The founders of the largest holdings for business services does not seem to be prepared in his case to the monitoring of the institutions of El enebro irresistible.
From the board, he was five of its seven children herausgetrieben. This appointed on the shareholders meeting on 18 January of this year, which has already been contested handelsregister is listed, to verwaltungsratsmitgliedern.
The El enebro a meeting of shareholders by the judges of handelsgerichts number 2 in Madrid on 16 was convened, a clap of thunder in the lap of the family Álvarez.
The annulment of the judge on the timing of the Assembly is the only legal way, the convening of a meeting of shareholders.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez mezquiriz by David Alvarez as "a desperate resources of the applicants - his five children - are interpreted by means of legal wrangling, fraud and rechtsmissbrauch the vacuity of assembly of 18 January recognised ', as official spokesman.
This argument is the basis for the questioning of the Assembly in retrospect, it is a "absolutely void '.
The same protagonists in discreet silence in June already tried unsuccessfully to richterlichem path to convene an assembly.
In El enebro - vermögensgesellschaft and holders of bodegas sicilia Vega, alongside other assets - controlling David Álvarez 'seven children 100% of the capital.
On the other hand, the demands of the founders of the familienprotokollen dienstleistungsgruppe according to the user rights over 51% of the capital.
That is the background to the issue on which the judges in the hearings on the treatment of anfechtungsklage, for which there is no date has been set, to decide.
Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a geheimwaffe of Siemens
The car with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1 eindrang, is your history in this splendid universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid the newcomer and despite a steeply rising background during the recent seasons, the final spurt last November, all to the victory of Ferrari's by Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilots and weltmeisters Sebastian vettel or leistungsstärke the motors of Renault to belittle is the "geheimwaffe" that the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus siegerteam created on the legend.
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company 2007 for purposes other than motor race, on the market.
This has been described as plm informatikprogramm for the development of montageketten in factories around the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used.
There is an exact reproduction or simulation of a product or process, before it is built, so as to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles of Nissan easier.
Siegfried russwurm, chief industrieabteilung of Siemens, declared that the use of these software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull 'in a few hours, almost in real time, "the changes and improvements to the race and the tests are discovered, to devise and implement.
Russwurm contends that in 1992, in the rennställen an average of ten technicians worked in a season of a maximum of three or four improvements have been able to introduce.
In red bulls team today are 180 skilled young people, with powerful do they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the rennwagen.
The siemens-manager plm-software was declared that all the components of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the motors, is solely responsible for the Renault.
The materials, fuel, the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed.
The changes, thanks to advanced factories and hightech-autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of simulators in reality.
The only limit this crazy technical perfectionism is set, the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 - team for his race in a season can spend.
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and manufacture of his rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London off the ground.
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly by journalists - very circumscribed.
What is happening is top secret.
The workforce is 580 persons, including the two pilots, the World Cup vettel and mark webber.
But red bulls genuine Formula 1 - hero zweifelslos the latest world champions Sebastian vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy-drink-hersteller in the service of its participation in the race tracks, there are other protagonists, whose support invaluable and their fame is nil.
The technologichef the site, Steve nevey, stressed that five years ago could say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50% of the victory and the pilots contributed to the rest were responsible.
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85% of the success, while the contribution of pilots to 15%.
Nevey recognises that webber vettel and never can be replaced by computer, because they are not "voraussagbare gladiatoren '.

Sabadell wants his rival in three years, a million customers' clutches'
The caretaker Member of the Board of the Banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, and he believes that in 2001 a tough year for the banks, but first dismisses a new liquidity and predicts that the end of the schuldenkriegs.
Nevertheless, it introduces a collapse in zinsspannen, the banks with increases in charges and prices to compensate for loans.
Sabadell expected, in three years' time, a million retail customers' - a still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to use the next three years, and so in a very complicated economic environment to survive.
The Bank will introduce a new dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The aim is not just to survive, without the public aid from the frob, but also the market share of a million retail customers - 700 000 if the customers, the Bank will lose to increase - and this is the great challenge facing this Bank, because up to now it has its business customers, more attention than their customers.
This year it has 250 000 users and 50 000 company dollars.
Their access to the market in retail customers is 3.5%, while the business customers, more than 10%.
Another principle of geschäftsplans 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerität, reducing costs and the challenges which the Bank so that it will, together with statement.
Only a few banks are daring in these difficult times, to publish the objectives and, as a result of the financial crisis around the world, all the banks in disarray.
Sabadell this year will be its four years ago guide whose use optima. This was initially to three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended by a year.
The customers, the savings banks are leaving, are the main objective of the Bank.
In a breakfast guardiola apie organised stressed that 2011 would be a difficult year with a large scope. "
The managers assumes, Spain would only "slowly" out of the crisis.
It would also be very difficult, in two or three years' work to create '- is vital for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war of liabilities - which will be punished - zinsmargen wane, raise risk premia, the banks and for their emissions to the conservation of liquidity to pay compensation for decreasing margins already on the price of loans themselves.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are of a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have the Hahn not marginalised, but the zinsdifferenziale are very high," was guardiola.
On Thursday BANESTO were already ordering their filialnetz, the allocation of long-term loans to restrict and to increase the zinsdifferenziale cf. CINCO Díaz on 22 and 27 November).
The managers also acknowledged that the banks watched the stategie, "to increase the charges', but 'within a competitive framework'.
Sabadells guide whose use is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assured that in Spain 'larger companies are necessary. "
"in the coming year will change everything," he assured.
It stresses that the need for capital is rising at present 'enormous' and does not exclude the fact that some Spanish financial institutions in red figures slide.
He is of the opinion that the frob kaptitalaufstockungen could replace the monetary market.
After he assured that sabadell a temporary closure of the markets can survive, he refuted the argument of some bankers are already in a new liquidity predict.
It stresses that nothing can be in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, we can achieve short-term funding on repogeschäfte and intercept the crisis.
CECA includes a second wave of mergers of savings banks from
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta yesterday, rejected the possibility that there might be a wave of mergers of savings banks and emphasised the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
As the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were a number of savings in the first phase. They retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes (CECA), José Antonio olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
I believe that the majority of mergers is completed, the inclusion of cajasol in the group Banca cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it was about adjustments. "
"the largest part has been completed, and it may be that we replace siebzehen 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed, identified by Banco de España, all of which is strongly supported, controlled."
One of the directors and managers aragoniens (adea) organised breakfast led olavarrieta that the process of concentration "as quickly as possible and that we should be satisfied with the timely expiry, in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España stipulates," he emphasised.
'the transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million vermögensbestand to 17 of the 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process, the number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much more, and that is what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement, "he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that 'there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the unseriösität and absurdity "revealed, because" Banco de España reminded us, before the end of the year. "
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorosesten financing systems in Europe and 'perhaps' around the world, and added that those who anzweifeltenn this' without deeper knowledge '.
The managers pointed out that we are in the current economy 'no' on the situation of the financial institutions, and of the need to make savings, which is a very significant "concentration process have gone through," as quickly as possible 'will be completed.
It was also due to the fact that the Spanish banks, the stress tests, which the ECB in July, a very good thing had existed.
Mr Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, the no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the national lottery.
On the other hand, it supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört.
How are these events?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position no mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
It is Germany a fundamentally new prospects to shape our future, with the preservation of ancient traditions of most of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern.
The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries in the South to leave the euro area.
Second: the reintroduction of the German mark - even though it currently looks more like science fiction sounds - supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control and strict financial management and punishment of the countries which are crossing the guidelines; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time now, which is why there is now no excuses.
First of all, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for the deficits, and the German Government, a constitutional reform fairly, in order to prevent it from 2016.
That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict steuerpläne and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal, a central European country, as Merkel, the decision to save Greece's painful hinausschob.
At that time it was strongly criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published absolutely opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the past oktobertagen anew with a clear position, and it calls for a reform of the Treaties of the European Union, to the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to enable private lenders to commit to a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as irlandkrise and all the following.
But your proposal, although somewhat sugared, has been accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has a red line, it does not exceed.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken, from that date, the old workings of the euro will no longer be available.
2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, this can be forced to declare itself bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector is a part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard economic growth, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The alternative to the indebtedness and construction of massive holes in the balance of payments is based, as was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would be wrong to do so, it is not understood.
It is not just a question of the deficit until the year 2013 to 3% runterzufahren.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, we were to cheat.
I hope that the current turbulence more calmly.
And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies, last Saturday, and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, its own house in order to create their way it has been.
Nevertheless, Germany drawn red line is here, and it does not seem that change.
In contemplating means is that the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out.
In this case, Germany might still say that it has warned us.
Sport and regelumgehung
Tricks like the Alonso and Ramos game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will of a sanction.
The putatively of two players of the Real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) evidenced by the exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax of the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsportliche action or not acted and whether both players of UEFA should be sanctioned.
As is well known, the two players a few minutes before spielende (your team had already been clearly won) time and played a number of fouls, now that the referee the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be that the two players the prescribed sanction against the next ligaspiel auxerre comply with and without cards in the next spielphase.
Finally, penalising the disziplinarkommitee UEFA the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two games and the relevant players with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this branch of our rules.
Part of the debate have arisen in the case to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished), and the key role played by the dramatisierung mourinho, an episode to its long history and has added theatralischer and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not expressly of the statutes of illicit behaviour runs counter to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of sport, but its meaning.
In this matter, should the sporting spirit ailment be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which is not threatened by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam. This did not happen.
The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule has not been secretly executed, in order to avoid a sanction, but they should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referees.
The gambler waited and the sanction one.
Another question is what kind of advantage the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has benefits for the game erheischt gespielte, because the obvious result of this was that the own team with less players to play.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because of the club is not about these players.
The advantage is that the players of the next spielphase the Champions League without cards participating in a future game could threaten to begin.
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because the team will retire. In addition the players with this approach a sanction and, in the second kartenzyklus on, because kartenanhäufung with a card fewer than in the first cycle departure.
Thus, it is not clear whether it is really a advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, including strategic decisions belong to the provisions of a maximum benefit.
In this case, the players not a sanction to circumvent (that is, indeed, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, when you of this.
They met a strategic choice, without a penalty or to sidestep it.
Although the boundary between imagination and regelumgebung blurred, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two selbstausschlüsse and because of the type of provoking regelübertragung.
The damage to the principles of sport by these acts, is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
As for angebotoffensive kundenfang gruppen-weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona.
The dictatorship of the calendar, this year an avalanche of reservations on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The employees themselves are paid out; they do not want more than EUR 20 to 30.
As the turrón and weihnachtslotterie exist in the run-up to the hotel and gruppenabendessen freizeitgewerbe emblematic oxygen opened, but as a result of the economic crisis, you resolve a preisoffensive to the kundensegment the bulk, ': almost all want between 20 and 30 euro for a mittag- or dinner, confirm the respondents entrepreneurs and associations.
The accounts a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) all orders in the week of 13 December are the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner of two spitzentager (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies which gruppenabendessen, for budgetary reasons.
These traditions do not have to surrender, many workers pay for them out of their own pocket.
As the economy, it is also always be demanded niedrigstpreise confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona gaststättengremiums gaietà farràs.
The representative of the dachverbands is not to predict how the holidays in this month will be.
"people are considering 'tens of times before they are implemented."
"they want to, but they respect the prices," he stresses.
It will go well, "in which the quality of good prices with a good service ', he added, and to remind us that the customers in times of crisis, why prices by EUR 25 most inquiries.
In a survey in various Central restaurants, it transpires that the night of 17 December 2008 the broadcaster to collapse.
The Group soteras says that the demands for this Friday, with the intention of less than EUR 30 to spend, would be going gangbusters. The group has its menüs with komplettangeboten between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In a different political group andilana, the 16 restaurants in the city maintains (hostal de la Rita, market, La fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar early bookings, even at the beginning of November.
"We have the impossible, with the vorjahrespreise menüs 19,95 for every taste of up to EUR 30 to maintain," he says.
As to the El mussol grup, and a total of 23 ququ attic, local, you lose the optimism, not once since the second quarter of the revenue to flourish and good, even if a few days concentrated prospects for the weihnachtsgeschäft just.
Sources of corporate group would point out that the 18th day with a überaktiver freundesgruppen, the Christmas vorfeiern, will be.
The six gruppenmenüs weihnachtsmenü was for EUR 30 or more than preishit added, one has the impression that the customers are prepared, 10% more than in the previous year and in exchange for more details, such as, for example, cava.
In some firms, green sprossen are, which is why the employees once invited. This gives the impression that the gruppenessen again in the recovery.
From the dachverbands fecasarm (with mergers as kneipen- restaurant- freizeitverband, and Barcelona), the deputy chairman, enric gomà to the end of the tunnel and noted that the bookings generally right "lively," although the customers' a maximum pennies. "
The fun of celebration is, however, has not fallen, regardless of who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear program has aroused great concern in the United States
Islamabad is nuclear weapons' faster than any other country upwards. "
Revelations of WikiLeaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The website WikiLeaks revealed content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the us-staatsabteilung confirms the immense concern about Pakistan's nuclear program Washington.
On the fringes of the explanations and hefty details, the documents on the content of the discussions and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, reveal that the cooperation between these two countries in the field of nuclear safety is not strengthened but, on the contrary, "decline," and that the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons' to a faster rhytmus than any other country '.
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons, but their parts to be stored on a possible attack to complicate its destruction, preparing Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Petersen, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: 'the proximity of nuclear installations of the beleaguered area of the Taliban, the probable verstreuung of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material. "
The large number of people in the nukleararsenale and the raketenprogramme implies, not only by the United States, but also of Russia as ausufernd and reason, caution, regarded.
Pakistan must strictly gläubiges staff for the surveillance of nuclear installations, because of the low educational and cultural levels have extremist organisations more opportunities to people who are involved in nuclear or raketenprogrammen, to reklutieren, "said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his American counterpart.
A new feature of the website exposed by Julian assanges documentation is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in the Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declared: "There are often no transparency; on the assistance we receive no replies or they are rejected."
In another communication confirms Peter lavoy, officials of the state security service for South Asia, "despite the economic disaster in Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country."
The Ambassador Petersen asks Washington during a visit of the Supreme heeresleiters,, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, to clarify the leaders' "that" Pakistan's army to stop its tacit support for terrorist groups. "
In pursuit of WikiLeaks supremo
Obama will appoint a high level of those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning to persecution and capable of Assange.
Everything with WikiLeaks and Its begetters, jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, which is difficult to investigate the facts.
Yesterday Interpol a 'red' to 'search and persecution of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional configuration of arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden.
It also assures the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, "the police to know where and how they contact with Mr Assange."
On the 20th, the international police body, with its headquarters in Lyons (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but it was until yesterday, after receiving power by the Swedish authorities.
That is the way things are. The 188 interpol-länder, Assange to identify and locate him, 'provisionally arrest and hand them over. "
Although Interpol the arrest of a red warning not affected individuals can impose, many Member States according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - the national police forces must be carried out, in particular, if you have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange presumably.
This approach is outraged assanges lawyers, the gestures published a letter in which they are informed that the 39-year-old founders of WikiLeaks is ready by videoconference the questions of the Swedish authorities to answer.
They also recall that Assange's departure from Sweden, and of the prosecutor, the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorisation.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution 'in the letter.
While the world is seeking him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - that Assange asserts itself in an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of the magazine time by Skype of a vague from an interview in the conversation, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"if it can be proven that it was responsible for the classification of North American diplomats spy on the UN and international agreements signed by the United States has broken, they should resign," he said.
His opinion yesterday the pressesekretär of the White House, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for the resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
'I am not sure why we value to the opinion of a type with a website should, "he told the CNN.
Obama himself has a heavy responsibility for the antiterrorismuskampf rusell Travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen.
The attempt by the spokesperson of the präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange less attention, stands in stark contrast to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in those days.
Congressman Peter King, from January chairing the national sicherheitskommitee of the House of Representatives will lead staatsabteilung has the possibility to investigate WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "whose money to seize and all the support it or to make a contribution to follow."
Tom flanagan, consultants, the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to say, Assange "murdered" revoked.
"Obama should transform it into a target and a manned flight or what."
Who is not apologising, Mike Huckabee baptistischer, Minister, the former governor of Arkansas and possible nominee.
"who it was who in the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is eiine to mild punishment," he told the sender Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders of the Party allows a secret vote on its continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a formula for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes rudderless ERC from the way to go.
The chairman is aware that the threat of resignation the close of the former Labour party whip Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not sufficient, but it also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened, as your mentor itself and not impose the same headache as other former trends.
Therefore tried the leader of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics, what its position until the next elections would secure.
For the beginning kündete yesterday that the over 200 Regional Council of the ERC is to remain in office secret could speak.
With ballot papers, not with superior hands.
If the carodisten the präsidenen a supposed to miss, they could do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division and subservience to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would with half of the votes plus one not to be vindicated, and he added without prozentwerten, as a result, "in the Bulgarian style 'is not good.
The Carod close to the President to call for more than just the party office, an inadequate gesture, since puigcercós the supreme body of kongresse controlled.
But, since they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance resignations, they are with the Bureau a vorgehensplan from now until May.
This is what they expect of the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the auspices on 18 to the vote in the Council to be able to participate.
Its intention is to underwrite for puigcercós. In return, the promise of the Congress in the autumn of 2011, the leader of what is already a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphonie 'shame of stability and it seeks once and for all, the organisation in the situation, their dirty laundry wash behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article of the President-in-Office conseller Josep huguet in his blog signed, symptomatic.
In view of the puigcercós an ideologist, the holder of innovació it is a fact that the leader 'in exchange for various objectives' will be supported.
He was five to two.
Firstly, the 'restructuring' of the Bureau, so that at least 90% of the Party members, that is, the incorporation of new faces from carods environment.
The second is the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should finally abandon vollversammlungsprinzip than operation.
So verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should enable the kongresse with elected representatives.
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party - is puigcercós' team, which has, in the last two conferences that fought obsessively.
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a congress on the reform of the Statute should deal.
This deadline is still out, because infogle internal aufruhe of recent years is tackling this issue was not advisable.
Now, with the critical sectors on the lookout, the time has come to address this matter once and for all.

Obama is in Twitter for the law in favour undokumentierter student
If you for the adoption of the dream act - law, then reputation of your senators and insist on the adoption of this law, "twitterte the President of the United States in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama supported today the nationwide mobilisation to support the dream act - law to legalise undokumentierter students with a news on his personal blog in the social network of Twitter.
If you for the adoption of the dream act - law, then reputation of your senators and insist on the adoption of this law, "twitterte Obama.
The briefing note contains a cyberlink to a larger document that the public asks unterzüglich with their senators in contact with, since the vote of the law attack was imminent.
'with your vote that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you, "he stresses.
The news has been disseminated, after the 42 Republican Senators androhten all agree on every law to block, except for the extension of the reductions from the days of Bush and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade in one of the 42 Republican Senators signed letter was announced, on the vote of the dream act - law and other projects, such as the ratification of the new start-abkommens with Russia to combat the spread of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the law dream act and other projects consulted, said the präsidentschaftssprecher Robert Gibbs, he trust that, once the steuerthema resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be drawn up.
I believe that we still have a lot of time... '
"all, we agree with the steuerangelegenheit before the end of the year, must be handled..."
I believe that we can reach an agreement at any time, and we can then the expiry of the remainder plan, "he said.
The leader of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, kündete on Tuesday, "he would vote at the end of the debate ', so that the dream act - law with which the legalisation initiative undokumentierter students from next Thursday in the Senate, could be put to the vote, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the dream act - law or the law of the American dream would roughly 800 000 young people in the United States, as they have not immigrated sixteen years old, were during the last five years have lived in this country and a higher educational or in the army are enrolled.
But the defenders of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, and that is why it is to the voices of a handful of Republicans. At the time, the organisations of the advocates of this project a strong influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority of the dream act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from nebraska that he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced its support of the law.

With literature the finger on the weak spots
The second round of the mood of the language 'was a walk in which the participants for the narrative heavily,
'The sex in the language I do understand, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me? "asked the writer Luisa valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua' opening up a cycle, the spanischsprachige literature, and on that occasion the subtitle of your question, (on another event was the round table the sex in the language, it declared).
The finger on the wound... "brings us in difficulties," spuckte the Argentine schriftstellein sweet the audience that mainly from young people zusammensetzte at the international Buchmesse in Guadalajara (fil) met in this by marisol Shultz moderierten round table, to attend the valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa valenzuela Las a text which you Gonzalo celorio and the Shultz afterwards as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in the first person and is a champion of the search is to know what a 'sore' and by the doctor to doctor, of which you are not the answer, but references to guide their narrative.
The infektologen leaves you convinced: 'patience is not my strength, maybe that is my problem. "
At the end, after a very frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, in the middle of the way the breath raubte, and their but stated that wound a scientific concept is psychoanalytiker enthült of the secret: "The wound that is truly open, the symbolic is the scar."
The like the narrative sighs facilitates and includes the "of the wound only learned that this truly open and does not exist '. But it is convinced that the mood of the language and their traps mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans, Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise the invention', and the finger on the wound is not mentioned, but will be detected.
With reference to the magical realism he tells a famous zauberin the clouds gereiste men was covered, or of a girl lost virtue wiederherstellte. The narrative has made a U-turn and reported by America, the great Roman, from the beginning of its own chronisten, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the abundance of the eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (writers), spottete invited the hypothetical quality of witnesses in the true stories have appeared, but in a different way, the history of America have never been told - with imagination, even the shame has disappeared."
However, stresses that 'it is crazy and liar, the best things to imagine, "and there are nearing reality and lie, where we no longer know which side the narrative, where the fictitious literature the summit.
He calls the 'tradition in Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, what tells us."
As Mayra Montero the number was commented and praised the writer of the diversity of interpretations, including the invitation of fil the round table 'the finger on the wound' contributed.
The kubanerin puertorikanerin devoted and its contribution to the great awfulness of social violence, which affects their country - as Latin America as a whole, as a result of the fighting for the drugs trade.
'I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs connivance, not deliberately intended commitment to abstain, "she told, after they had highlighted that literature and binding communication is between the author and readers as" a chemical reaction'.
This evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution 'the fingers of the hard-working writer in the awfulness of the writer' hevorhob.
He said that, in a very fast-moving world, the intellectual habits and the control of awareness on dogmatismen, and will forget that behind every confirmation of a small 'no', and behind every denial is a minor yes. "
'in the possession of our thoughts and the reality of the situation, we must set an example, and moderate means, often, the finger on the sore spot and to harass those which, if they feel more comfortable in the form of cartoons in black and white, ready-made ideas without nuances, and also the powerful to harass, prefer the world in black and white sittings he observed and invited to rediscover the spirit of the letter.
Romano is fighting his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in endspielen, it has gambled and ABS in his career, but he played three major games.
In the match between Santos and Monterrey Laguna the endgame, there are also two different from their respective trainers stipulated styles, and whose of contradictions, this meeting is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in endspielen, it has gambled and ABS in his career, but he has experienced three major games, and so far he has done well, and that is why this opportunity of particular importance to it.
The Argentines, with the coin for the second champion played, it is one step behind the victors and, amazingly, he has lagged with the same team consecutive endspiele.
The santistische strategist, the first endgame as a trainer in the 'torneo apertura 2002', as del morelia the reins in the hands, with which he made against toluca 4-2 learned with a great defeat; later, at the 'clausura 2003', it is crucial to match it with 3-1 against rayados lost.
With Santos Laguna on the 'torneo bicentenario 2010', in which you played against Los diablos rubén again had to absorb a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los choriceros after 210 spielminuten undecided, but the penalty came forward with 3-1 and two ways of losing its title, but ultimately failed three of its players of the eleven steps and thus play a 4-3.
Rubén had two endspiele with diablos rojos and one with Monterrey, his main rivals, lost. That is why it would not again be prosecuted by the accident and evil zauber, for the first time a title celebrating, although it confirms that it is the most important part of the game itself.
'I want to champion, I do not want to break the statistics, is for a club, for my affection, I am hingebe, and that is why the title to me, but what happened previously, is the most important, "commented at as the one on the lost endspiele.
The last endgame is still heavily stayed with him, he assured, learned a lot from it: "the only lesson we can draw from this is that by the end of the referee not obeyed, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared to all the players, because the last time we were with two elfmetern already prepared, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series of misery could be chosen, not because he trusts his players: 'It is never misery, it would be in the regular spielzeit, but sometimes, there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense desire, the title in the hands, the left us with something to this end game, and we hope that this time it will not happen. "
It is romanso power, not just the second champion and, for the first time, the glory of costs, the title.

450 million in contracts without tender
In a consensual way hydro-québec projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the wasserkraftprojekt eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 Treaties is a consortium, consisting of the firms bpr, Dessau, Groupe axor sm and that the main proportion, namely the projektleitung, to a total of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, known as the 'énergie gérance' 2004 as a by-product of the decision, the private sector hydro-québec their accountability, hydroelektrische this important project to the tune of a sum of $5 billion to entrust, formed.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium 'énergie gérance "the lucrative treaty, without there being a public invitation to tender.
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung and a rise in prices.
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and refutes the competition."
This means that we should not fix games rather than on secret way now carrying out in an open format, "said yesterday Sylvain simard, a Member of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the early morning had simard the question of the National Assembly, because it seems that it is difficult to understand how the interests of the public in this way, can be applied.
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had reacted in the afternoon, vehemently deny, that this Treaty is a stitch-up would have acted.
"I am sticking to my line," they raged, confirmed that the PQ "dishonest" and "lacked rigour."
She said that it was the least that the PQ be sorry.
The model of the consortium is in practice.
It is usually at a time of such temporary alliance that there are two or more companies, their expertise in terms of a requirement for a tender for a complex project.
The project 'eastmain' has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes.
The bauverfahren is under way and should be drawn up until 2012.
However, the Treaty has been missed, without a competition was able to take place; it had already been negotiations.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects, no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le devoir "last week has pointed out, it is in the area of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium of regierungsermittlungen.
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows more than 200 consortia to nominate, some of which are of a more consistent duration appear to be.
In this way it works, for example, the company Dessau, in partnership with the majority of your kernkonkurrenten which Cima + snc-lavalin génivar, or Roche and tecsult count.
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal entity, namely in Dessau.
What the consortium 'énergie gérance', as the Minister normandeau stresses that 'the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec this fact and that since the 1970s, in a special way, however, take into account'.
Réal laporte, the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (sebj), has issued a statement that has to be on the fact that the Treaty on projektleitung after agreement was approved.
"If you have an invitation to tender, and there are only a few candidates, your prices soar."
"You are therefore two possibilities: either you nimmst the people on this Mart and you are saying: it will be a satisfactory agreement on a good price."
"the idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," reaffirmed laporte.
The Consortium 'énergie gérance' approved Treaty is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois user dollars.
The Treaties were either of the hydro-québec or sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
That review was the newspaper Le devoir "more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the companies or their branches, including in particular ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 granted.
Snc-lavalin had 22 treaties in itself, had received gerafft génivar tecsult 16, 14 and 10 in Dessau, without their participation in "énergie gérance 'counting.
All these agreements have been negotiated.
They amount to the entire 449 783 344 dollars, including the Treaty with "énergie gérance 'on 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm axor) and the Parti libéral du, Québec, well known. "
Minister, who had normandeau PQ is equally linked to the firms that they "financed" before they specify that it is, in fact, whose leaders.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the 'green' label is not very heartening
Green, but clearly sceptical.
The quebecer consumer has little to do with the protagonists of sustainable growth, but also to the marked brands or öko-kennzeichnungen his election taxes.
It is a pity, but in a swimming medienwirksamen universe, where information is in favour of a responsible consumption teeming: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to mourn, a shortcoming that impede its commitment to mislead power, as the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although the use of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, seem to have promoted the quebecer nevertheless, those who sell it to try little credit.
Two thirds of the population quebecer, in fact, the environmental commitments, rather than relax them of firms, nor to believe, as the Greens unternehmenswerbung, betrays the responsible consumer centre of the University sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Another fact: half of consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the official, the supposedly fair products annexed certificates, but also the credibility of products and brands, as disposing of declarations such as the barometer.
Following the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue by only 14.6% of the population quebecer seriously.
The information concerning responsible consumption is, however, important to stimulate this konsumsegments, currently, approximately one third of reviving quebecer consumers.
In fact, as dampening empty and dubious character of the information the zeal of 46% of the consumers.
This is the price of the product, the second part of the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, there is a third of the quebecer of the indicated performance of green products and services that you are to present, with mistrust.
According to one other communication has had more than half of consumers in 2010, changed their habits and predominantly the brand of one or more products defected to their conviction.
According to the barometer, they were 61% procurement dealers and their stadtviertels favours the purchase of cultivated food in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of into environmental consumption, in this year of a 64 maximalwertes of 100 - homo consumus of Quebec loves the King of recycling, which is trying to present, in the environment are collected traces of reducing, by the animal welfare.
But the social and ecological awareness, however, just before his car, so the barometer: barely 28% of quebecer have indicated, in 2010, or the use of public transport mitfahrzentrale prefers to their environmental interest.
The walking and cycling were also 39,1% of participants in this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage supports the stereotypes.
For the incorporation of excentris staatsanleihe
The quebecer government, the Société Angus and the company parallèle was called upon to do it financially to the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris to participate, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive borrowing.
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus and the company parallèle, a donation of EUR 7 million dollars from kultusministerium for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois excentris kinokomplexes belonging to the Boulevard saint-laurent hoped, at the back of its actual cineastischen function to entrust, apparently not what you have asked.
The government has accepted, in this case, however, get on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation provides quebecer government rather a loan in less than the amount initially hoped for a viable solution to the advantageous conditions of life could, at least according to the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, which was once again bittgesuch since the overall downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan have already been expressed by the President of the "Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles" (sodec), François macerola st-pierre, Minister, the acts excentris.
Several days ago, he had a recent technical report.
The counter-proposal of cabinet, but sodec on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time on this.
In any case, it seems that the premise of staatsspende really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the adoption of excentris had revolted by the argument invoked, the Culture Ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to make it not also have other cinema.
Several other participants of the light cases, on the contrary, the substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had the eigenfinanzierten construction of cinema over ten years with great difficulty in the premises of the autorenkino kinokomplexes presents the unique position on the part of the Treasury.
The lack of cinema, the independent films in Montreal is more than obvious, and excentris knew his clients to keep.
The Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately financed campagne, of which they are a sum of $700 000 for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009 continues to only one screen, films in excentris to show, namely Le parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirer, it is that the three kinosäle on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film of Xavier beauvois hommes' et des dieux '.
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper Le devoir 'is not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the downward corrected proposals that you have made.
Secret of Canada lifted komplexgeschüttelten
The new American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread to reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians, with regard to the Americans; they, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats astonished that the Canadian constituents in the ballot, not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the interests, and they believe that the visit of President Obama, the conservative government helped its budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public have been disseminated yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome.
One of 22 September 2008 carved link, i.e. in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing, reported on the point at which the United Nations is no longer in their political leaders discussed operations.
The great astonishment of David Wilkins used in Ottawa, the American Ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation.
"The Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex, prompted the Canadian, political leaders are much more likely to internal disputes of everyday life, when the United States in this election pass the buck (as in 1988 during the campaign on the free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, so he schlußfolgert are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially to threatening, in order to talk about him."
The Ambassador understands this' deafening silence "even less, when the two countries intensive political and economic relations.
'logically', he should assess the ability of candidates, a party and much more of a party to hold such an essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense. "
The other manifestation of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009, by Terry breese geschäftsträger in Ottawa, sent communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa.
Your visit will help the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in Canada, his first deficit after more than a decade to announce, is the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars ," describes breese.
Nowhere, he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the sitting before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the coalition were overthrown and this conditional continuation of opposition parties on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms.
A further, from January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins authored communication agreed by the ever growing image of Washington, on CBC broadcast, dramatic series of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts, such as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or contributions for the purposes of the CIA conducted by muskelprotze interrogations can monitor.
Yet another communication reported in detail on how Hillary remarked in their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner, in her first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners in Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner, the answer is' yes', but on the basis of an individual 'case-by-case' -entscheidung.
Àm at the end of the meeting, "he has described the Mrs a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed over, a 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin."
"The State Secretary has promised that the acts once again durchzusehen '.
Finally, we note that the mood in the website WikiLeaks.
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely inundated consultants, on CBC declared that this massive leak killed 'responsible'.
He was here to Mike Huckabee CITES from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN has yesterday in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC's), the almost one third of the additional reductions which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the specific projects that the UN in Cancun to implement hopes for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of the industrialised countries.
After yesterday's plan would be the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) due to the lighting of the earth cast CFCs be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) to be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of the global fleets.
In Copenhagen last year had the great abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe, and other, Canada, voluntary reduktionsplänen commitment to the global fckw-emissionen GT from 53 to 49 GT downsized.
This assessment should, however, be 5 Gt, from now until 2020, the klimaanstieg to 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise, in order to prevent this spiral out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears built for 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduces this energy once again for the twofold.
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen are, on average, between 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those of the producers of Philips this week on the market - this society has participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than weißglühende pear, which is a suggestion of the savings of auswechselungsplanes, in 100 countries should be applied.
Apart from the fact that iese completely new incandescent light bulbs, very little heat, can you also with a regelwiderstand work.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out, kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and that they must therefore as hazardous waste dump in the developing countries is not always possible, except the producers are bring centre.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power stations that emit more mercury, the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity.
In the United States alone meet these coal-fired power stations 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits which each country thanks to this international scheme would generate.
Indonesia would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 savings, that is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose erbauung Indonesia would cost EUR 2.5 billion.

The whole election could be cancelled, if the Gbagbo complaints lodged by the Constitutional Council will be taken into account.
The gbagbo-kontrahenten, however, are now believe that the Supreme Court of the country is not neutral, because it is by Paul Yao N dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane stripped, a man of the North, of any link to the ex-rebellen is disputed, the delay in the announcement of the election results as' unacceptable 'and Gbagbo asked for these to be respected, even if it has not so far, the victory.
His bündnisparter Gbagbo blockiere reaffirm the publication of the results, because he knows that he had lost; and to submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after the Electoral Commission prevents the results to publish seie illegally.

Affaire Clotilde Reiss: elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "spy" was detained, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The Wikileaks received and the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Americans had declared its strategy, so far, this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of wanderern).
They show how the French authorities have tried to Washington to convince the liberation of young French person, not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and imprisoned by the American justice because of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes fugitive iraners to gegeleistung.
After all, the way in which the French Presidency the media to the purposes to manipulate this credible to the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role to play in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss played, a harsh light.
In fact, he had nothing in this respect.
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm entitled "Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with hostage-taking."
François richier, elysée-berater -- to be accompanied by Patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d 'orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone.
You said the French method.
The advised the Americans to do everything to ensure that their own nationals rückzuführen, the violently held in Iran.
"power noise ', they said,' articulated, loud and clear, without letting up 'the words' grundmenschenrechte ',' innocence ',' immediate release 'in the media.
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to its image.
," the more so since you ask the Iranians to do."
Because 'silence solves nothing', passed on to the diskussionsversuche unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "masters in ausweichmanövern '.
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners, Iranian tactic of a "normal": "hostage-taking for political blackmail."
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes) 'demand the payment of a large amount of the Iranians' (230,000 Euro bail).
And it is known that the Elysée antizipiere further hijackings, a phenomenon that 'will exacerbate. "
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens, living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is twelve days been released from jail, will, however, continue to Iran.
The information was circulated: the Iranians Majid kakavand to extradite the United States due to illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial in Iran, is following the decision of a judge in Paris has been released from detention.
The American Embassy is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
In Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material for the nuclear programme, is the release of Majid khakavand a bad news.
France has a horse-trading in?
The liberation of iraners against the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September, François richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not just 'completely surprised by the decision of the judge, "but have also tried, against the authorities.
"It is a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice ' (currently given Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the French Government can the judicial decision does not change," he says.
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service.
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number, once again, then, the American diplomat, the Iranians' is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy buildings in Paris. "
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spare its efforts, not through pronouncements and the Media organized "fluchtversuche 'belief that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad games' important 'and' influential role as mediator."
The Americans are not without irony of this activity and the manipulation to bear fruit, because several articles of the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram presents "medienblitz the French authorities'.
What is so much "dankesbezeugung to Mr Assad, the Paris message.
"despite the statements of the French authorities lobpreis secretly that it is only a vague idea of what the syrier indeed have done."
The document also deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée this fiction to lapse.
The intensive communication 'aims, Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm, "he analysed.
A policy of 2008, launched at the time by many kritikerstimmen in France and in the outside world as premature and unverdient was perceived. "
"The Syrian role aufbauschend 'attempts to Paris" Syria, what we can achieve belobigung by a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also to 'discord between Syria and Iran is sowing. "
The American Embassy knows this from good source.
On 11 August, François richier to her, "of course we do not know whether the syrier whatever '.
"But we have, in spite of everything, we thank you. '
"this should at least try to confusion on the part of the Iranians'.
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 in France.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué would like to thank the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its active role in favour of the release of our compatriot. "

In a chaotic frenzy because of corruption will appoint the executive committee on Thursday the FIFA World Cup ausrichterländer 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in the rangeln for influence and the lobbying of the technical criteria to push into the background.
One thing is certain: the issuing of 2018 the accepted FIFA in Europe, their traditional stronghold, (the four candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien).
The issuing of 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the international football hopes, the first on the African continent in 2010, new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its establishment in the United States or in the Far East, South Korea (Japan) to pursue.
The list of figures to the delegation with Mr David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the level of economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes, therefore, face up to the last minute.
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates.
After an evaluation report of FIFA, the English, spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees on the hour of the election is not so great.
The Sunday Times with the achievement of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations that might as well the chances of their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only once the World Cup was allowed to thrash out, namely in 1966.
The BBC was once again on Monday breeding ground by favouring an own colour, the three influential members of the kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou under attack.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the British authorities to embarrass, in the first place, with David Cameron in the last few weeks an intensive lobbying.
The head of government hopes for a re-run of his predecessor, Tony Blair successful schachzuges, in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012 had achieved.
Would this intensive use of sufficient to the image of England to revalue kommitee again?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo spanien-portugal there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its fußballkultur.
However, the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the chances of Russia, which, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) to the weighty outsiders, increase.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided that unumwundenen suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote by the kommiteemitglieder.
"You bewirft with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin raged.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites.
First, the headquarters of the economic world power fifa-hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which is a very good project separately.
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, the competitions co-organised in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA long-awaited allocation of the World Cup 2026 for China and the Asian chances of 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, the stadiums aufwartung futuristischer all, FIFA has pursued its expansion into new areas, but these two countries a greater risk than certainty.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea in the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (zeitverschiebung), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
Offenkundigkeit second mandate:
De Gaulle was really clipped.
Mitterrand had believed that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac, not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012.
But it is the side of offenkundigkeit mysteriums, it cannot have not managed to face.
We must therefore pretend that the doubts now exist.
On the one hand, as well as in the other direction.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even believing.
On 15 November, assured Nicolas Sarkozy in any serious tone, his decision 'at some point in the autumn of 2011'.
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before ump-parlamentariern the prospect of 'two credentials' full dignity, was therefore a little fieberhaftigkeit.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President has just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008 the number of five-year terms shall confine myself to just two.
He has made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have, at worst, still seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told you in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: 'do not think that I am not thinking about the period thereafter. "
His words from the day before yesterday, not to make it more candidates than the previous day, but also no less.
They should comment, from a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the candidacy wettlaufes with the PS on one side.
But it is not the incorporation of competition with Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy are so desperate to unfold.
On the contrary, it is an obvious candidacy in 2012, the number of Members of the PS earlier than accepted the challenge admonished.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the right to a candidature of François Fillon, of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to a poll bva-l 'express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," reacted immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister.
If it is a defeat as possible, it would be not candidate 'shares Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always be believed to be able to prevail," Alain Juppé corrected with offenkundigkeit resigned.
The euro: the ECB is forced to maintain their acquisitions of staatspapieren
The last meeting of the Federal last year the ECB should provide an opportunity for, as it emerges from the crisis, or at least ordering a large number of non-conventional actions of the monetary policy, announce the end of the year, to its conclusion.
The crisis of the European public debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt, there can be no doubt, even today, more than tense situation on the European bond markets to verwirken, not their worsening.
The political cost would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday, at a press conference held by the ECB, to play an active role in resolving the staatshaushaltsverschuldung welcomes.
It has not dared to whether you believe that the Central Bank can do more, for example through their programme of the shopping of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners (...) '.
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, the previous day in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament are not very redegewandt regarding its projects, but rather merely to point out that the purchases of staatspapieren in secondary markets' "would be allowed to continue and that we in the House on Thursday 'will see how the decisions will be'.
The only certainty: the ECB is its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligationskäufe of schatzkammer by the ECB last week at roughly 1,35 billion euros has doubled.
And according to the leaks of some traders to you yesterday, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese staatspapieren have made.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases in excess of EUR 67 billion.
Under the anticipation of the traders will no doubt weiterverfolgens of kaufkurses (see page 29).
The economists are already a remarkable change of course.
If the anleihengeschäfte of over three months ago from the arsenal of the ECB will have disappeared, and the full geldmittelreserven on freigiebige way to put through a period of a week of up to three months.
The economists are already today, that this measure will extend some months.
I cannot imagine that the ECB programme to amend fundamental way. "
"otherwise, they take the risk of new tensions in the short term to provoke," presumes Michael schubert Commerzbank, the economist.
'for the course of the first quarter of 2011 nominated, progressive withdrawal seems likely, in turn, anticipates Norbert bräms economist in sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the market of public debt 'the ECB should such a kaufvolumen aufrechthalten of securities, the sluggish market stimulates', Norbert bräms.
In view of the relevance of the vulnerable position of European banks in the markets of public debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence on the market.
"You must, at any price, to the steller the lack of investors on the market and so act to the premature nature of the enthusiasm for the weakest States paid returns', an important obligationeninhaber bezeugte yesterday.
Because if interest rates to the boom, the Member States would be even more prevented from their debt to reduce or even stabilise.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy to cover
After a worrying week for Italy, the situation yesterday with the decline in eckzinsen to 10 years, a little relaxed.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti the situation qualify as "unentzifferbar" and a "unvorhersagbaren" weekend have expected to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German interest rates its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the Treaties to cover konkursrisikos had risen to 263 points, which caused a certain kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi was in the Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates by 400 basis points.
His right hand, Mr Letta, however, concerned as "hard" of the "market turbulence 'and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, such as Greece or Ireland. "
The bad news is that Italy, as Portugal is ," declared Irwin stelzer, economist on the Hudson institutes.
Basically heisst that his problem is absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge the state in danger, its financing requirements are no longer able to meet.
The last Brussels predictions were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, expected... although the Senate is examining budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission will be calculated, next year's budget deficit or 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the governments of the projected 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the uproar about a new haushaltskollektiv that after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"if necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountants Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"the foundations of Italy's economy in order and its accounts are regulated, repeat that we already have for a long time," assured arrigo sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"at the moment, there are no problems either to short-term or long-term perspective, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, for example, that R.) stabilisationsfortschritte calls for less than other countries', observed, Pier Carlo padoan chef-volkswirt the OECD.
There remains the question of the political unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi, a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, face as a result of which the preferred elections at the end of March could be organised.
It is therefore a little favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the reinforcement of antikrisenmaßnahmen after
Christine Lagarde, it was only yesterday, in a press conference in Paris explicitly stated: "I believe that it is still on Sunday afternoon and evening demonstrated: the Europeans are clearly, are ready and committed to their currency and to defend its currency area '.
Although completely relative - yesterday, withdrawal in zinsfüßen the European staatsobligationen was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
A normalisierungsbeginn can still not the case.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it was the Portuguese schuldenvermerk, the most effective target of speculators nowadays, unproductive.
"as in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly in the banking systems rests," the opinion of the economists of the exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, as' the political time passes much more slowly than the markets'.
The countries of Europe, both of this gap, as well as the danger that it is well aware, to intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing antikrisenmaßnahmen.
The informal discussions between the closest affected finance ministers and, more generally, with their counterparts in the G20 is progressing well.
And this also in relation to the sittings of eurogroupe and ECOFIN at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is today.
The plan is the fate of the non-conventional measures to save the countries of the euro area in the bulls eye of markets (see the bottom).
What eu-stabilitätsfonds, so that its executive director Klaus Regling on Tuesday in its asien-tour singapour started the investors in the Far East, on the developments in relation to the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit was not explicit fundraising, he is preparing this to the ground.
The first werpapierausgaben from the eu-stabilitätsfonds are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the agency Reuters entrusts the United States supported a possible increase in the additional, through the direct engagement of the IMF mobilized funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, in turn, structural reforms, particularly in the field of the arbeitsmarktorganisation.
Reforms to austerity, but effects in the near future to show.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
On the one hand, and the other is at any price, to avoid having to ask for international assistance, before they set their own budgetkorrektive and essential structural reforms have decided that, in the long term, the confidence again.
The European investors, in their turn, have been on the options available to the normalisation process of the markets of bonds to be speeded up.
Axel Weber, on 24 November in transit in Paris, was the idea was first created, that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billions of euros were not enough, the Union will not hesitate to take back into their own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market, the European public debt in the forefront of player, an extension of the EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably 'in the form of direct liquidity injection.
This means: the European mechanism dotierter finanzstabilisierung currently EUR 60 billion.
An advisory committee, all the opportunities, closely in the European capitals examining.
Above all, if the conditions worse.
Snow and black ice: 24 departments in alert orange

The Prefecture 'calls on the drivers to exercise the utmost caution on the streets and the corresponding adaptation of their driving patterns. "
The Directorate-General for civil aviation (dgac) called for the airlines, Thursday 25% of the airport in Paris, and 10% of orly from flights from the expected, strong snowfall early to be deleted.
The dgab recommends that the airline passengers, to contact their airline.
The airports in the south of London Gatwick and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, have until Thursday morning.
Métro grand Paris: first financial tantalizing glimpses of Europe
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built.
The baubeginn the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of EUR 4 billion.
The theoretical scheme is the sum of the SGP then that would allow the markets of the finanzsumme to their dual.
Today it is, after all, the first projections.
The amending budget for 2010, this morning studied by the finanzkommission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged in the first part of this money.
We are talking here about two measures: the creation of a special tax on erschließund and a higher taxation of offices on the ile-de France.
The former funding, so Article 15 of the law, is in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris. "
This is estimated: 'the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year.
Zweitere is reorganizing the existing taxation: "in order to modernise it from their educational product, and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to entrust."
How much would it propose?
A puzzle.
This amount is not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is a long way away.
'It is stated that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of kapitaldotation be added by the State will be found and Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done, "is the explanatory statement.
The SGP will take place this system is not objectionable.
"since the moment in which the revenue recorded (the two taxes, R.), the studies on for three years, blankets and then from the fountainhead of 4 billion," says.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimates that started in 2013, which will be 4 billion for the budget 2014 to note.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised we will be able to seek, runs the risk of a law, parliamentary debate.
The first meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The affaire Wikileaks has a twofold importance.
On the one hand, it is an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in sinner hypocrisy, the beziehunge between the Member States, the citizens and the press governed.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, and gives a foretaste of the regression dominated by future.
Let us get things in the right.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service 'acts (an old nation) exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi are nothing more than what we are discussing months in any old Journal anyway to read, (except for those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time substance for their sketche.
The rule that the secret dossiers is already well-known news consist, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only this century.
If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will recognise that every factory (via the grail, the mystery of the rennes-le-chateau templer or rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats what is already in previous works.
This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts to publish any research (or, therefore, that he does not know where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who devote the okkultismus, nothing other than what you already know and confirmed what you have already learned.
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown.
Also, the secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise, whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), the only true considers what he recognises.
The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat cleverly, was the same as those who have already published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier?
On one side is this what every well-educated person already know, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government can call each other or a plane, to the dinner on meeting - have lost their diplomatic role, and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben spionagezentren have turned in.
Any old viewer from ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact, to repeat it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: the idea that a hacker geheimsten x-beliebiger the secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap entails the considerable blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats.
In addition, the scandal less the victims rather than the 'Executioner' is in trouble.
But we have the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, Orwell's time, it was all power as a big brother, every gesture of his subjects controlled.
Orwell's prediction would have been totally right to emphasise, where any movement thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens dignity to the total victims of the eye of power.
However, if you look at bearing in mind what is happening today that even the secret krypten is no longer the control of hackers to escape the kontrollgang listening to be directed at unilaterally, and will zirkelförmig.
The power controlled every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired a vindicator of the citizen - the secrets of power in experience.
How can a power that are no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets?
It is true, Georg simmel said that a real mystery an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel's basically a secret free from geheimis, because they reveal the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks to be disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of any power.
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done?
It is obvious that the Member States will, in future, no longer be reserved information online - that would be one of the street corner angeklebten aushang.
But it is equally obvious that the current technologies in vain hope, confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State of a plane moved and one of his colleagues has contacted.
How could, in the future, private and only for certain ears certain relations?
I am aware that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and romanhaft sound, but I am forced, I imagine, regierungsagenten on secret and uncontrollable marschrouten active in moving to meet their messages anywhere other than in the mere memory with tragend and, furthermore, the few written information you have been given in schuhabsatz verbergend.
The information in one single copy in closed cannot be stored: basically, the spionageversuch of Watergate less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays as a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraf communication had revolutionized, reconstructed the Internet with a telegrafen (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) videokassetten had filmforschern, a film bond for bond auszukundschaften by the forward spulen and all the secrets of installation drop, while the (digital) CDS nowadays nothing else, as a chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen.
With the high-speed trains travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by air, including the switching three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual that politics and communications technology in car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press to understand what mysteries between the embassies were forged.
At the moment, it is the embassies, the confidential information from the press.
Climate, such as France, its finanzversprechen amount
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the financing pledge rapidly resolved ("almost start 'or premature funding) to investigate the developing countries.
And the gross French vulnerable to blandishments.
With the Copenhagen agreement, the developing countries are committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France has promised to 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has all the partners of the fact of their commitments regarding fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference, that great nebenevents broschürenverteilung.
The operation and extent of transparency is remarkable for its real value is estimated that the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau.
The EU announced, in 2010, EUR 2.2 billion released to what they are on the right road to respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty 'and', in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what 'and' means.
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation of certain Member States, including France, the procedure blocked.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers the best.
The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009 for: the international finance are being retained, and within the framework of funding 'fast-start "150 million over three years.
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either as regards year or in terms of the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the financing of 'all new projects' of 2010 are "new and additional '.
In other words, there is no indicative in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of the French support for developing countries remain stable (or discourage) - France gives its commitment to the "new and additional 'financing.
Another important element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus.
Some countries, such as France, have lent €1 as an equivalent to 1 donated €.
This is apparently difficult to justify that the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects, which actually based on technology) can be justified, it is illusory to present the euro, known as the equivalent of EUR donated to pervade... and only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of interest rate).
But France has nothing changed in accordance with the following thought: it 'respect' its commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5% loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36,1 million euros) - see the document, in order to convince themselves.
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent.
Germany is 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% of donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of European Union €to fulfil their obligations, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a similar effort.
Beautiful hocus-pocus.
All in all, operated on France in its fast-start-finanzierung with a dual sham: a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time, and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France, manages to believe that this 420 million "new and additional 'million in accordance with its promises, and it saves it has spent 36,1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy the arbitrage has carried out a doubly negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not completely misled...
The chapter of premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate.
But it may be too much of the drop in the cost of machinery UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is essential that its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn.
First and foremost, France may amend its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the counterbalancing fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing forward (another decisive and is currently discussing): you can escape the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or verbuchungsart its loans.
France could change its position as progressive as regards the disputes, as it is in other areas.
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, next week in Cancun will arrive.
A surprising announcement on the fast-start France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit 'and the use of loans would naturally the international trust to raise the need for further discussions.
The alarm, of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years ago, on the day 81 different chemical substances, so this Wednesday of the unification générations futures (former movement for the protection of human rights and the respect of future generations) published a study.
The unification, which stated that its results, given the small number of samples analyzed no statistically significant value, but illustrationscharakter pose the problem ', between July and September, usually within four, of a ten-year-old child meals around the food consumed plus a zwischenmahlzeit in the supermarkets in oise and Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and obstteilen, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, as well as naschereien of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The tellerbilanz is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as potentially carcinogenic or likely to be judged and five as safe karziogen klassifizierte, as well as 37 substances with endokrinin-störfaktor, according to studies of various institutions, such as the international cancer research centre.
"even if, in virtually all cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually held substance are not exceeded, the funding of this survey but it is very good that the reality in which consumers may be carcinogenic substances or substances with endokrinin-störfaktor is suspended, is worrying," noticed the unification.
The breakfast already contain only the butter and tea with milk, more than ten of potentially carcinogenic residues and three safe than carcinogenic proven, as well as more than twenty residues which can affect the hormonal systems.
The Brazilian imported apple than zwischenmahlzeit for the study foreseen, traces of six chemical substances, including one in France distinguish fungicide.
The same applies to the Greens beans from Kenya, including the lunch, where the study traces of the EU strictly banned insektizids stated.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from Pandora, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap the analyses of the presence of nitrates and chloroform brought to light.
At the dinner that was lachssteak with 34 identified, chemical residues on 'richest', and even to do the meal used in the microwave plastikteller was not unencumbered.
The risk of this "schlußendliche schadstoffcocktails' for the consumers' is probably undervalued," the study.
The "Alliance Europe ecologie-les Verts' (ee-lv), for its part, has" in view of the urgency of the situation ', a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in view of the increase in diseases of "to a halt.
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of 365 different residues in fruit and vegetables identified pesticides identified in Europe are consumed, including 76 in getreiden.
