A Republican strategy to hinder Obama ’ s reelection
Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and affirms that electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die because of the fall of lightning.
Indeed, the lawyers Republicans have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the US states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein a majority of governments Americans enacted, from 2009, new laws that hinder the process of registration or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the elections of November 2010, who saw the rise of 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 states.
Consequently, during the year 2011 180 were introduced draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that voters submit a photo identification, in addition to a test of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduced periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and withdraw their right to vote to people with criminal records.
Before the elections in 2006, no American state demanded that voters should submit a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
Therefore, the republican authorities rushed to extend it to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills 34 states to compel voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to keep in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, have no photo ID issued by a government agency of his condition.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those features.
But often, obtaining identity documents required costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions affect disproportionately affects young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of the people over 65 and 20% of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years do not have a photo ID.
And there are still more.
In many states students, most voters to vote Democratic candidates, they cannot use the photo ID issued by your institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize the members of the clubs of fishing or hunting that tend to vote Republican parties to use the documents issued by the clubs.
Before 2004 no state demanded proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws abolishing the registration of voters on the day of the election in eight states.
In addition, restricted the right of individuals and groups to create a service of helps voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, the campaigns of registration of voters contributed to the registration of around 10 million people.
Measures taken since 2009 put the rate of registration of new voters will fall in 2010 compared with the year 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that contribute to the reduction of the vote in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were African American, while the latter did not represent more than 13% of voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same.
These represent no more than 11 per cent of the electorate, which amounts to a 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, the congressional Democrats and their supporters have protested strongly to the adoption of laws that restrict the register of electors.
In this regard, the governors Democrats have blocked several bills.
The Public Prosecutor of the United States intervened to suspend the laws more controversial.
It was, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that required the submission of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that with these aims to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center 2011 shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college for the presidency.
It is too early to say with any certainty whether these legislative changes to scale of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: Let the Going test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test is sometimes inaccurate results with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided that unnecessary medical interventions.
It is a good enough reason for wavering men, already reluctant itself, as to whether they should be made or not screening tests.
Do Going the test or not?
We have sought advice from two specialists.
In the studies in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make recommendations firm.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not.
The study, with up to 12 years, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if it has not been conducted the tests.
I therefore recommend to 50 years, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African American men have a higher risk.
The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to achieve the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. He must provide all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that does not vitiate the life in the long term, in which case you should opt instead for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who were detected cancer are not treated, given that the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to his life.
Instead, we suggest an active monitoring of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment.
“We find increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test in any case.
But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not the test must be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the investigation, the adoption of healthy choices remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the illness.
We believe that if everyone ate well and move enough, could be prevented a 30 per cent of cancers.
"If nobody smoke, this rate would, at least, to 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10 percent of cancers are inherited.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85 per cent of cases of lung cancer.
It is a risk factor for other types of cancer.
Greatly jeopardizes the health of the people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 billion smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Fat and obesity are also conducive to the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, pancreas, oesophagus and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they added.
Food
The agency recommends also limit consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, climb the risk of colorectal cancer.
Meat products must also be avoided.
The conservation of meat for smoking, curing or salted can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"May damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", we explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, scientists have studied the link between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, by the time its research is inconclusive.
The SCC, Ségou studies of vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what took place was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been able to determine clearly.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talk about the concerns and the family history of each with their doctor.
"Detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs bosón in detail
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosón generated a shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed that this bosón joins in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What is more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model: Our best or "less bad" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the field, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists is not totally clear question of Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and very much like the Higgs bosón predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week in a physics major conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, while more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem few. We will see what it is.
There is, in this great world, a law and inescapable that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way of breaking the rule and not try too, because it will end up doing harm.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, has shown that there is also a law of these features: The principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles may not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same state "quantum"; a "state" consisting basically of some of its features.
Physicists classified particles into two categories.
On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists that has no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means that can be found in the same place, at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure Laboratories Berkeley who, incidentally, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: The taverns, of which we do not here, and the "force particles," for which the major forces of nature and spread with which the Higgs bosón would somehow related.
These bosons, it should be underlined here, are not the exotic creatures that might believe.
Indeed, if it is able to read this report, it is thanks to an extraordinarily bosón banal: The photon or the "particle of light" acting as "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or change of direction, "mess up" the electromagnetic field in that very environment; a bit like when we launched a stone to a pond.
In this "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons "bearers of force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs bosón, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disorderly" for this bosón appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needed to extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface.
Why do we need a huge particle accelerator as the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relation between the Higgs and the mass.
Indeed, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, they do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will not by itself never attached to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), they are not.
However, what "can make all these investigations?", asked Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and may, moreover, that physicists escrutinen differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For its part, many are strongly desire, as the minor difference could open a door to a new "physical" that tape some holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge gaps, as it does not propose any explanation on the seriousness (ups!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the area of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of such research in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe we are wrong to say that will not have any.
To see: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories are not suspected in the revolution that would work.
Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more.
Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where they invented the laser in 1960, and that developed the first laser (the former were down) in 1962, the laser was considered a "laboratory apparatus."
Imagine...
In addition, the application can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the investigation.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light sensor in 1969 in the course of research in the field of lenses.
Despite that was not at all its original intention, this sensor now serves as a "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel physics in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
Dignity in Dying in your Commission, Québec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate must be adopted soon as he prepares a draft law.
However, within that domain essential, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has attempted to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment of the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a break of two years.
"I was given five years of life, but I have been so seven", recounts, made a pass, lying in bed in the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, arrived at by the previous day.
"But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this," continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc: An enormous weakness which prevents him from go only to the bathroom and even eat alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, resigned acceptance that help you eat.
Brave, even to smile, to speak with the strangers who devote attention, these medicines and offer a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My fondest wish is that I heal diarrhoea, is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found remedy that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes pee standing," recounts Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the centre Victor-Gadbois.
Return to their childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept this retreat," notes.
Because, according to the opinion of the majority of people working in palliative care, the great moments take place at the heart of this regression.
All patients who enter the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
Forecast of life have a maximum of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative care."
The biggest fear of Ms. A., 89 years, is dying "aware and drowned out."
But the disease has made you discover their children.
"I have some good children," she adds.
"Since I have no more wishes in this life," he says, before accepting that placed a mask to help her breathe.
And expected in the coming days, a last visit of his son living in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps food.
Palliative care are being given when nothing more can be done.
To help his death is more comfortable.
In Québec have a bed of palliative care for each 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, because we know that all we will end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors from the centre.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The moribund will offer shenanigans of mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
To diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar.
The death is part of the everyday.
Yesterday evening we serve a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, her son was completed beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We both patients and their loved ones," recounts Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without never be the same.
Next to a man from 94 to eat his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed in their pillows while all drink to your health, a young 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds were occupied by people under the age of 45 years suffering from cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of the patients are admitted to the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives in the terminal stage of life, is at his home, in the hospital or a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the centre Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home, the Grand Montreal specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely this great lack relative in health care of Quebec which makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent persons of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system of Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has a right to palliative care quality before they accept to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," recounts, "I have seen a patient to 14 days in Emergency suffer severe pain without that has been done to alleviate it.
I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive proper care. "
And at the same time, many oncologists have mixed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already at a low ebb when left a tiring chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncóloga who wanted to stop treatment, she told me that gave it a pity that I would like to stop fighting," recounts.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
There is no care all-powerful
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking die thank carers to which they are treated in their demands once they have been eased their pain, thanks to a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful as regards the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatment against the pain in 8 per cent of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, whether sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the disease is relieved not to be able to have that palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved say all the same: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I euthanasia", but "I want I ease."
The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism research institutes of Health Canada.
Real estate scandals extent in Quebec
Officials of the road network, businessmen in BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
A "industry" that left too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, particularly in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we hunted to big media," observes Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the misappropriation linked to contracts of roads in Quebec, the liberal prime minister in that time, Jean Charest, had not consented only to delay.
The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts", containing some of their instincts to stay with a proportionate share.
The Commission Charbonneau "has already caused two mayors," adds, while hopes to reach "demonstrate the existing manoeuvring behind individuals."
A permanent unit anticorruption, created in 2011
The permanent anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, also applies to his team of inspectors, investigators and analysts from the government.
This unit works in addition to the police for "the squad Marteau", which, since 2009, have made the "cartel of sewage Montreal" moderate to inflate contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to registration in number of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal office as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town in the suburbs.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, just step down as mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
Suspected to have pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
It has indicted engineers of the road network of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused commotion explaining to the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He paid for three years a 3 per cent of the value of the contracts in Montreal to a middleman linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money left, right and centre during the years 2000, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
Also, he admitted to having organized a collection of illegal funds for the ex-deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau liberal.
Inflation in the cost of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, it perfectly before the committee: In 10 years received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, fixtures of hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector totalling $736,000, all in exchange for contracts of sewage inflated costs.
Other officials of the road network has admitted receiving money by inflating bills between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in concept of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately have turned a blind eye to a budget parallel and filled their coffers of dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Smooth was one of the first elected political Montreal sounded the alarm.
As mayor of the district of rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island since 2010, objected to the sale of a city land acquired by $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to promoters in the housing boom.
70% of the money of electoral campaigns was dirty money
The investigation that eventually will be held, it ensures that strip "of a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are preparing the wounds but would require a research unit cleans in Montreal and be very vigilant to the dubious practices are not repeated.
How do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declared that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned mainly by the role of the '"elected politicians abreast of the ploy."
Believing in a 70 per cent of dirty money that went to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, observes: "I have been told that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to political parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while not strictly limited electoral expenses, dirty money in politics."
Recommends a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot fall lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this history tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who desire to take a look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would explain this progress?
Could be explained by an individual consciousness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
They have great players.
I advance daily at his side.
The technical staff also has given me a lot.
And these elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that is easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I am not acaloro.
Since my early in the centre of with of INF Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
Will benefit from competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are used to play games of very high level.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player as I would like to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
Backed by attached as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti does is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one in the League 1 and is among the best coaches Europeans.
It has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think that will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a conversation with him very reassuring.
I had just emerged from a series of injuries.
The confidence that takes me also explains my good performance.
What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In the League 1, Lyon has removed the leader.
But we remain in the ambush.
One of our greatest objectives is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarterfinals with style.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, you can do anything.
But we have a lot to say on many and very good European teams.
We want, for starters, finishing the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the return of happenings.
Does the PSG can become a great European club in the short term?
Already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and being there in the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is handed over to their means to this project.
Not win the cup in the League 1, like last season, would be a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in lead that title of champions.
In the last season does not get far.
In May, we have been a disappointment, because we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
Finish with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a season rather better.
This year I think that will be the good.
Even if the major equipment like the Marseille, Lyon and the Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo.
Do you think that the media expect more PSG?
It is normal to wait a lot of us if we believe in what has been invested in the players that we have.
We have accepted.
After that we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, still with things to reproach ourselves is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what more expected people.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to launch a project of game.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League, we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to qualify, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, imaginaríamos with 15 points ahead of the day.
That would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, had been "driven" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we finished leading the trophy.
The PSG is entirely dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals.
Has come to demonstrate that it is the star of the League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams in the past that is a great player, a world star.
In the group that we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects to men who has around them.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes the others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, also enables all progress.
How do you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this match.
Unfortunately, my injury I kept accumulating game time.
VI things there and I strengthened.
Today achievement play good parties in the selection.
What is expected from my baptism with the "blue".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we now have an exemplary behaviour.
What image you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "blue"?
Is producing results.
Are well positioned in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved its aim to end to the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the selection to Brazil.
Does the tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundation?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought by all.
Before this shock in Spain, had not lived a game similar throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the contrary to current monetary exchanges, based in central banks, the transactions identified and the burdens of processing between the parties.
Furthermore, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system composed of monopolies, banking, financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at once a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol for change to the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equals.
There have been nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And nearly a thousand websites accept the bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment.
The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later today, before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com).
Is nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) enquired about him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In it, he described the bitcoin as "the most successful" virtual currency, "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as the "credits", used to move forward in a video game and you can earn playing or you can buy (and even sometimes redeem).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange a central authority controls and is the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, issuers of currency and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction was signing electronically through a system of double encryption key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins is contained in the book of public accounts, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write the new settlement in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a challenge to computers and mathematical launched the winner, a kind of central banker provisional, will have the privilege of adding that line complementary.
It is a file cut up phase, i.e. transformation of a large file in a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that offers a particular (more zeros at the beginning).
Once this number, the other nodes readily verified that is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, to commit fraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network will accept as valid only one of the two transactions; the other would be an orphan, as both have different tracks.
The computer that will solve the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but are divisible until cienmillonésimo, leaving a large margin.
The difficulty of that challenge is also reveals in every increase of computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins in deposit.
"The ruling does not affect the same protocol used," says Pierre Noizat, which just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB takes into account the possibilities of blanquo money through this anonymous service.
But the cash presents the same defect.
Actors such as Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the platform Wordpress, the accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the accounting and book showed that almost 80 per cent of bitcoins does not circulate.
Launched in November, the giant "cuts".
"$30,000 were changed," rejoiceth Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul bitcoins, which converts the gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a book on the currency, believes in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The bearer, moreover, manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Simply provide a direction that a phone can recognize and photographing "," said Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while to Bitcoin imposed, but in 2013 could be a change," predicts.
Furthermore, in its report the ECB expected revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this currency success.
We have emerged from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should leave by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army take possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without expecting anything to us.
We have punished especially Afghan peasants, who have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, to our 88 soldiers killed, wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
Want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if its causes joined the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they are no longer when Westerners are more discreet.
The departure of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab, that I noted from the top of the hills of almond trees planted by credits French, it was in order.
The convoys of trucks and tank returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then vacuum and the country involved in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
Its takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of its peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation was no better.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
Leading figures of the war anti-Soviet returned to power in 2001.
Have become speculators, seizing government lands for resale as solar refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the couple of enormous American outsourcing contracts.
Are discredited; most of them have struggled.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who take advantage of the American generosity: Capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
Have lived the modern world during his exile in Iran and Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 per cent of the population under the age of 25 years, Kabul is now with 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. The TV and its chapbooks Turks with a modern world has great admirers across the country.
The army is now.
Is it considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?
The former commanders of the fight anti-Soviet worry provincial militias to reconstitute already fleeing the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, deleting the post of prime minister who has existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai is not to foreign control, in particular during elections scheduled in April 2014.
However, his country depends on foreign aid from the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has restored its services, has not been solved any have been repaired or reservoir irrigation systems.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to government control.
Spread the rumour that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth.
And that only added to the sense that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract minerals iron or copper terrain and without any means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese almost have left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) excaven the immense site búdico and remain there as employers more important of the province.
It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country of extensive reliance on imports and exports, restore their normal relations.
French troops left on 20 November.
The new treaty of cooperation envisages the continuation of traditional assistance: Girls schools, colleges of children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the areas of military, legal, health and agricultural and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "winning hearts and spirits" and make the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions match, a service of civilian and military actions "" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO extensively in the collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of locations in mountain.
These jobs and delectable to obtain local labour, have been able to help contain the insurgency:, irrigation, drinking water wells, reforestation, fruit trees, sunscreen and increase in agricultural areas.
What we will leave as I recall after two million euros of military expenditure?
A budget rather modest will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of lawsuits, written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To release of the insurrection conducted by the foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new dual or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever regarding the constitutional declaration, which was temporarily assigned full powers, he decided to play everything.
Took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote their final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the head of State had given two months to this Assembly to finish their work.
And nearly two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, weakening the institutional stability and legal entanglements.
This new initiative has not merely increased fracture in the country.
To his opponents, the president continues with its autocratic delusions "and" continues "betraying his word" and "trampling the law."
By his supporters, ensures that it is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.
In the next 15 days should be organized a referendum.
A very short period of time, which requires the Brothers to renounce its draft explain the text article by article, the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of regaining a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote in favour, as stated in an interview with the weekly American Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or vote my text or take the full powers," supposedly powers will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange atmosphere in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist in their great majority, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of Liberals did not go to the call.
In November, a little before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they believed that they could not assert their points of view.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
To make the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, replacements, hastily.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles have been adopted unanimously.
Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically to the sentence, so much so that members of the committee came to believe that the Constituent clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, under the spotlight, remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of the Shariah constitute the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, would hopefully be able to replace "principles" by "rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals the label of hypocrisy and believe that it is no more than a marketing trick.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They concern, in particular, article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University a consultative role, especially for anyone who has confirmed its compliance with the laws of the Shariah.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, is disturbing because "people call to pronounce is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy. "
Fears of liberals were further augmented by the fact that the next rector of the university would be far less moderate than the current.
"For now, there is a particular religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the context of marital status.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of them trained in the French system, "explains Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But recognizes that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, because the language imitate vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [can], Islamic jurisprudence.
And the question that might arise in the future would be the extent to which the civilian judges are competent to rule over all of this. "
Beyond its religious, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism that relate to the widespread powers given to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that few compared with those who were during the previous regime.
Another sticking point: The powers of the army.
According to the desire of the military, the budget review of Defence will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national council of defence.
Nor shall prohibit the prosecution of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the partnerships for the defence of human rights.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which considered liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, with potentially grave consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president should leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of State demonstrated on Saturday.

The blue waters of there are a brine that easily hold up to those who do not know how to swim.
The surroundings are really beautiful.
People come here to spend courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing mud and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, eczema, allergies, asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, diabetes and in order to put their broken nerves.

In Jaffa you can find newly wed couples lifting that come from all parts of Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the strength of the crusaders.

The money for this trip is unsuitable carry it in euros, but in dollars, that can be easily changed to shéquels (currently 1-3, 8 shéquels).
Urban transport consists mainly buses, but there are tram fast in Jerusalem and Haifa is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six seasons and connects the Lower City with the City High.
In reality, it is of an underground funicular.

"The big and powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language
While Members and human rights defenders argue about the impact of the law on the mandatory review, have already appeared in the country tricksters dealing with certificates "false"
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of countries of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its sole objective is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December enters into force a law, according to which each migrant labour should conduct a review to test their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention to work in the service sector institutions, community service, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Migration Service, examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pay the review of the language, but also the of Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language they must confirm even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions include the citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Will not be subject to this law people who succeeded in obtaining their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fate and defence of human rights
The network of centres reviewers will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute of Pushkin, the Peoples Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher learning Russian.
Immigrants may be submitted in evidence in all the cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 such centres.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Migration Service.
But defenders of human rights, long before the law came into force, they often put this question to the press: What will this in reality?
What changes will bring the binding nature of the knowledge of the language, for both the Russians and the immigrants themselves?
Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour".
Many people speak today on the defence of the rights of migrants work, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated prior to his departure.
Only a system of selection organized will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or spend the medical supervision.
Without understanding of the language, the future, says Sebelev immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, "put a paid trip to a" shocking and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints of our immigrants.
"In his homeland promise them a thing, but were deceived, deprived of their passports, wages are not paid promised," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Immigration Service labour immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
It is not angry, jefecito!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which seek to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: Few Turkoman, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone calzarlos dressing, and buy back to school.
To reach adolescence, these guys venturing to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if we do not know the language, recognize them.
"You feel humiliated and lower."
However, as regards the law on the tongue, human rights advocates point to an important point.
Examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If you do not have this status, there will be no consideration and, accordingly, no formal work.
Meanwhile, the majority of immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or prevented from strangers"
Many visitors claim that receive official status in our country is not so easy.
The case is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, the legalization costs money: Twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and only 500 roubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, we are not registered and appear cases of extortion.
"We are 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented to journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, do not be stingy, bought a painting"
The first day of the entry into force of the Act on the tongue, revealed that not only the registration documents of immigrants can be false.
Several false "certified" knowledge of the language have already been seized by officers of the Federal Migration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, arrived at the hands of the new owners not as gift: Each immigrant queriéndose facilitate the task of the evidence, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the formal process of review, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption to the "diplomas are not" can buy, converge government officials and defenders of human rights.
So far, the authorities can promise to migrant workers who had not been able to successfully pass the review the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior takes drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with weapons registered is rather limited
The Ministry of Interior intends to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the Government at the recent incidents: Squeeze fired during celebrations of weddings in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov squeeze, where seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raising the minimum age for obtaining a licence to bear weapons, from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the committee of the Duma security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession of weapons will be carried to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem using the "hardline policy."
In the network has published an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of gunmen, demand desist from such measures of stringency "meaningless".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of weapons registered is minimal, commented on the BBC news service, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered firearms in organs of the Interior 1168, compared to the total number of crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the area of civilian weapons will not be a drawback for which the offender is directed to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow can find any weapon at low prices.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the Interior stated that the situation of proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Vendors: From factories to officers
The black market is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, said retired Col. Victor Baranets, who for 10 years he worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders of weapons
The first, "vestige of the army or military", i.e. the weapons were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The following types of weapon "black", the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here include weapons stolen from the warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the bodies of law enforcement.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military stockpiles.
In many military arsenals had often explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some were caused fires deliberately to cover the need," says a exmilitar.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also put their bit.
"Now have proliferated private factories of weapons that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow," says expert.
A source over black market is smuggling.
A large quantity of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There have their own production, sometimes craft, and has formed a mafia that has organized the flow of arms," explains the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was developed in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of problems and planning of governance.
Specialists reviewed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat criminological, bibliographies and data from public access portals that thematically revolve around the weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons of the black market has arrived there "because of staff whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places where armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases were stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent corresponds to the archaeology "illegal."
The dependent on one of the weapons stores, who asked that his surname was not mentioned, said the weapons found by illegal diggers not purchase no one for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers are addressed to military when they need a game.
Through some 2,198 provider purchase a unit, for example a gun TT.
The disposed of registration and the pass over the fence.
"This is the weapon to the city and sold to EUR 900 per unit with two porters", he says
"But, of course, the police this aware of all the issues, so regularly, when we have to comply with the plan of crime detection test, make purchases of illegal arms dealers," adds the dependent.
"As a" luxury Boutique
The seller and the buyer are often through known.
"I visited websites and blogs until a type that I proposed that out to the platform" Begovaya ", where it would be a man who I would lead to a suggestion -" "where we could negotiate.
The price of the weapon, I heard only there. "
Viktor Baranets military commentator
"I need to get a weapon a friend who has contacts", said the shop assistant. "I have a friend, but I am very much counting on him."
In the market there are vendors, but there also has to get, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, which requested that told him that he had fallen a tooth to her daughter".
I can even get a couple of mittens of steel through a person of trust.
He also I the supplied only to me because he knows that I am not going to shop.
The novices are seeking weapons of different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
Schemes, in his words, have not changed.
He was issued a photo album where there had "everything".
"I felt like a luxury boutique", recalls the military.
The buyer, as Baranets, does not offer a pig in a poke: Everything that can be tested.
I, as a potential client, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.

I have heard of these systems: Usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People make orders.
The buyer makes payment through an ATM.
"In response, sent a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is a hidden," recounts the press secretary for the NGO "The right to arms", Dmitri Kislov.

According to official statistics of the Ministry, compared with the period January-October 2011, the total number of such offences in Russia was reduced by 7%, which constitutes 22.900, and the number of cases identified theft or extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Go on strike employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in US
Up to a quarter of young Americans find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald 's"
In recent days, in the United States has started a wave of protests against the low wages paid in supermarkets in the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald 's", "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy' s" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
For now, no one dares to say whether or not he will arrive this wave to the nine points, or if you have meant losing forces and amansarse in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by the trade unions and of a number of NGOs on the left.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries earned by workers of Walmart and the fast food system, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade unions of workers in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Do and six cents a year?
The shares began last week after Thanksgiving, called "Black Friday". That day, in United States coomenzaba the orgy of rebates that captured million inhabitants, and sometimes was accompanied by fighting.
That day, some workers of the corporation Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and picketed protest together with the trade unions and activists of the left in the shops of the corporation, whose products are directed at people with modest incomes and moderates.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their shops are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the larger supermarkets.
That is why many workers underpaid Walmart buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products made of Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words two critical, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low price, in part because pays little to their workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklift or hand scanners.
The "Black Friday" participants in the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical worker Walmart, which receives $9.5 per hour, this is excessive spending, said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the company $3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1 per cent more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart placed wage increases in the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $has more than they spend now.
Supporters of Walmart say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" continued in their tents from 8 pm Thursday until midnight on the following day and, during this time, Walmart sold around 5,000 articles per second.
In total, their cash registers undertook the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the website of the left Huffington Post, who left his job "less than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest had not been more than another trick "public relations", organized by the union workers.
"¡Fund free!"
Protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not department stores Walmart (which in this progressive city have no appreciation, and why now there are none), but the "McDonald 's" cheap and other restaurants.
¡McDonald 's said that sold billions of pieces, and then even give you sick and you pay for your work honest!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York
Currently, according to the federal law and of New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
The fast food restaurants will grow over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York $8.90 per hour.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with this money, for me it is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of teenagers Americans went through the McDonald 's and worked there, behind the counters, part time after school, although still living with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there long.
Now, constantly setback in some interviews with workers from McDonald 's who complain that they live in this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know how to eat them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 Thursday morning in the McDonald 's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that ATMs and fast food cooks are starting to pay at least $15.00 per hour, or that they will double its current minimum wage.
They also demanded that the fast food industry is the establishment of trade unions of workers.
The law prohibits the US administration prevent them from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with chicanery and redundancies.
On the other hand, the administration seldom provides them with life.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy to unions cover the food sector rápid.
One of the main mechanisms is the excessive staff turnover.
Dissenting
Noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald 's located near Times Square, which included a number of local Democratic politicians, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' s said that is selling billions of pieces, and then even gives you a hospital or you pay for your work honest."
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent democrats in New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the fast food workers to receive fair wages and economic prosperity that deserves every NY."
As described by the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest demonstration of this kind in American history of fast food.
But it took only a few hundred people, including not all of them were employees of the service of fast food, where trabakan tens of thousands of New York.
It is not clear whether this will spark to trigger a mass movement.
"For now, deceive the brain is not so easy"
The issue of augmented reality, so popular among fans to modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, in its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement and later, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the relevant patent.
However, a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, determined that for scientists of that company, it belonged to a bygone era.
They lured the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group?
- We specialise in-person interaction computer, but in addition we seek to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
By now the great mass has been caught in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes plays with the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox Kinect sensors and represent a step forward and today sold without any Xbox Kinect, because we all have a stake in the gesture control.
- what the future holds?
- Despite Kinect has led the interaction at the physical level, much of it still occurs in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the exit is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in 3D, truly visualization systems based on different technologies, including the design.
It must rid the world of informatics to ours, the physicist, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also his surroundings.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable.
Firstly, the devil with these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the control by voice?
A very popular, but do you not believe that we overestimate?
- It can be seen as a panacea, remains of resolving the issue of privacy, if not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
Indeed, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, overall, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- how is that?
- For example, how I would ask you to forward this can of soda?
You will speak and the show at the same time.
- normally I only speak.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Or is, you want to oblige users to adjust to what can or cannot do at this time the machine?
Not necessarily, but is mutual.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These may be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about his work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have of the modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in the Megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this point of view, all existing technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to designers of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, made an adjustable delay contact sensor processing of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in number is closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the man-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require that the contact for more frames per second.
“But it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "" cameras, one of which is in fact the issuer of infrared and the second recipient of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor pitch visible.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or rather, expanded and enhance the required amount of calculations.
It would be a good idea to create a similar flexible Kinect, playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help determinr dimensional position.
- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted their glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, all the while hold a smartphone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: The best option would be a "augmented reality" transmutable when, on the basis of a platform of cloud, you could spend of glasses, the smartphone
The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private only things you can see them), but also their weakness: An augmented reality based on glasses not permitted to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often noted: No reply touch!
The hands do not feel nothing!
What responses prepares its group for this challenge?
- In my lectures often say that augmented reality is the seventh eruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I believe that the 8th could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the more interesting is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
¡Register touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed to contribute to these tangible "images in the air". For example, the interference of several rays ultrasonic aimed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to that one feels if somebody was soplándole at their fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Do you think that he feels it seems that should feel when you see something?
- That is a good idea, yet we have not tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located within a very short believes that goes to an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not as gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of the giant balloons.
For now, deceive the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That is what makes it attractive working with virtual reality to investigators, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal taste subjective instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "foresightedness of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the city: Often find recognition in Europe without Russia knows even.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from the top down, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Jardin de Verano or in meetings of fashion and openings.
Tables of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever it is discovered.
Kirill Miller is one of those young purely sociofilósofos of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of progressiveness of St Petersburg at the end of the beginning of the 80 - 90.
Moreover, it is a boy, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the mood.
Recently, took in his hands a organillo and became the right of St. Petersburg, which has matured to do so difficult role, for its bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
 - Kirill, why you are going through the city dressed in red and yellow and turquoise, for example?
- I chose red because I am fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and the image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggressiveness and upheaval of properties nothing good.
But my provocations aimed to start a conversation.
The entire history of my provocative actions are an invitation to the debate.
 - when comprendiste destinations list being an artist?
 - In a briefing by the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where it is displayed my work.
I realised that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became a friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent to those set out in Gaza and front, which led to "Pushkinskaya 10-" is over, and the new wave.
I sumí in theatre by clothing, music of all genres, but not by the letters.
 - And what is for you in your Clinic of art... - For me it was important to stand in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where they had to meet the best creative minds.
In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reforms, there was an artistic club music club, a bohemian, the house of bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The ear of Van Gogh."
Schnur and his friends sang songs light weapons under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was animator of many programmes before the time of Hali-galivskih.
They gave Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his career; basic education and training the received of us.
137 gallery "D", the "Club, are also the remains of the Clinic of Art.
There were our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected me, thus ended my conclusion.
In these new times is not comfortable work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very little worship.
 - There are in your work something recognisable.
 - Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed today and the occurrence.
I will make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".
The clowns are a timeless category.
I was once sociable, but now it is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything is embadurna and tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.
For example, the salvation of the world through a compulsory totalitarian and change of clothes.
Now you are by clothing, moving on the outside, but inside the person.
And, perhaps this person he or she should not give the hand, but spit on him in the face.
And deceit will be deleted when you change of clothes.
 - Recently saw we thee in the role of urban right. - A cultured city must have a hero.
Who better than I am to be!
 - Well but perhaps commercial art can be beautiful?
 - Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the collapse of cultures.
Before people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted a thing, the other simplones.
Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a $100 ticket for like at all.
We must now think about who you like.
Now, every hero worship has its 100 fans.
 - and to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands!
 - Van to see the abandoned, there is the field sex-social.
And a cultural event van 300 people, 10 thousand never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is fading.
I have to my fans, the most important thing is not deceive them, not spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young made such tables a collector the had hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which usually people ends.
Now often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
 - Kirill, what is missing in St Petersburg?
 - Buenos experts in culture.
There is a concept: The official culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
When the kings were the correct all was another way, the kings may not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the experts correct.
In Moscow, there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg that may well be experts, but are closed, because experts are needed to a higher level that properly assessed to them and to open road.
Now is thriving on personal taste subjective.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to find other museums.
 - What is for you St Petersburg?
 - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there are ground.
But on our stones that art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural fields and we now have more writers readers, this is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We must make the art is fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant of St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or an asteroid murderer.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on leave in search of a planet parts.
To preserve humankind becomes the main question: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet parts?
I believe that there is little to choose from.
Indeed, only two are true planets that may be colonized, at least potentially.
"These are Venus and Mars," said the chief investigator of the Astronomical Institute State, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It started to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago that experiments were conducted with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas.
In 1979 were sent into space quail eggs to check how the embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
As a result we get a chick normal.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, should stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
By not find support, the chicks were volteretas at random.
And after 10 hours in newborns atrophy was given a total of instincts.
Chicks did not react to the light and sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days simply died.
"And two times we were born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them,", says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a "biological" miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue experiments.
However, in the "only" biosatellite Bion will travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space with fetuses.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats had space offspring.
However, has not yet managed to address the problem of reproduction directly into space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, without their usual habitat, simply cannot make their sexual instinct.
The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an emotional fund.
Similar experiments have been carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel into space from 50 years ago.
The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova.
And the most valuable asset of humanity is the female body.
Our flying gull, and no one in the Earth could say: If it is after a flight into space.
May or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has responded to this question," says veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights all have found well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Centre hidrolaboratorio preparation of cosmonauts is a must, in preparation for the flight.
In conditions of buoyancy null, cosmonauts practising their skills to work in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If an adult water is a comfortable environment, while still hostile, for a newborn child is their home element.
The small men-Anfibio seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from birth until the moment the first swim spend only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," she says Marina Aksenova swimming newborns.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women is necessary gravitation, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness and abdominal muscles of the pelvis is decrepitan very fast, the ability of expulsion of the foetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, trusting in the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it pulls.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov makes this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the agency does not create the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn child in orbit is impossible to wear it with a special costume for training, as adults.
Simply be deprived of what is vital for him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange, will lead to back to Earth to a disabled, totally unsuited to a person," the head of the bioethics committee biomedical problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time, this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of the inspection system: The NKÚ "švarc" has not given with the politician guilty
In the area of public procurements, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although their application limp.
Says so Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its implementation must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack" and described the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also reached similar conclusions.
As an example of a bad practice, mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc system."
 The Prime Minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would not harass entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, is prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if prohibits something, in that case, nor the chairman of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to perform such controls or require obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which compared the legislation concerning public awards in both countries.
What exactly?
This is a parallel control that we are beginning to make some two years ago.
In a simplified manner: European legislation regulates how it should organize public awards, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, the practice itself.
We have united all and, although the control has not yet finished, we have been very interesting differences. Generally, the laws of our country is tighter and more "complete", however, the practice in some specific parameters is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stringent rules, but it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
What can bring in fact this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely common control of this kind could contribute to that we invest efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improving the limits, although this does not have a very positive impact.
The economy of savings mean getting a proper thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions.
But not by the fact of reducing the limit of awards mean that we will achieve this.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with both "red tape", that those who want to find flaws in the system may do so more readily than if the limits were as high as now.
You spoke of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing the awards prácticaa public.
How does the system of controls in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or organizes otherwise?
Regarding the offices, as the NKÚ, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school also, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also powers are to some extent analógas, however, while Germany is a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for the local legislation, is simpler than ours?
Generally, I would like to make a comparison with no specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but you cannot specify exactly what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That certainly, but not, I repeat, I do not like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries as a model that we must deal with a large number of problems.
Otherwise, they would not benefit collaborate with our office, do you not believe?
With regard to the laws of our country, what meant for his Office Amendment Bill public awards? Is it is somehow its impact?
Considering that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet expressed in the proceedings of control.
Since we ex post controls, there is a need for a certain delay.
For now, is in the process of preparing the future controls: We have initiated a new tool for detecting risks "economic" by which we did spend nearly 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as amended the limits, rectifying the situation of certain types of selection and similar.
Does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess to the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem is that the rules can emerge "harden" and that it is impossible to do so.
As with previous legislation, persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law does not respected award in the field of public meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then tighten up the law in this way?
I believe that in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of him and not to punish those who commit a formal decision, which has no impact on the taking of decisions.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And what comes out of this?
We will see where we take this path started.
The prime minister has recently declared that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with švarc system called controls, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
The system "švarc is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in any way and, if prohibits something, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office has the obligation to perform those checks and require obligations.
Can say: "We changed the law and we allow", but could not say that we will do as usual.
In the law on public awards in the regulation is the manner in which should be done formally. And that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the exclusion of the candidate with the best offer for failing to comply with the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we need.
The roads are ice floes, although most are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are plates of ice and snow.
Although most of the roads are passable, in some must be taken the precaution.
Karlovy Vary region
This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary was passable but showed plates of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day will rise slightly thermometers.
Has stopped snowing in the region and in the lowlands the layer of snow is fine.
In contrast, in the crests of the Montes Metálicos snow is nearly 30 centimetres.
In some places the visibility was even bad because of fog, according to information from the control centre of operations of the roads in the region.
The fast track R6 and the road of first category in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to exercise caution, especially in some bridges whose surface can be frozen and be slippery.
Also, are also usable all tracks of second and third category, including mountain roads.
However, there are still some sections with remains of ice and snow packed.
We must increase the attention on the road, especially in areas higher.
Hradec Králové and Pardubice region
In some roads in East Bohemia there is danger of frost and higher areas and in the mountains there may have been a layer of snow on the tracks, reported in its pages the Directorate of roads and motorways.
Operators of roads warn drivers about the danger that the formation of ice floes, especially in areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, or Svitav Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There are snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow packed on the highest zones of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of the eastern Bohemia, the sky will today between cleared and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will range between three below zero and a good degree, will be blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in the region of Pilsen are passable this morning, but must be taken the precaution and it will be necessary to adjust the time.
In the early hours of the morning will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent low temperatures, some ways could also be covered by ice.
In some places the drivers will find themselves with fog, but the visibility progressively improve.
This is what comes out of the information from the control centre of operations of roads in the region.
Highway D5 is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to exercise caution, especially in the way between the kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of the majority of the roads of first category is dry and without ice.
In the area of Plzeň and can bordering Germany may have sections with plates of ice.
The second and third category are damp, so that, in this case, also warns of tranches with plates of ice.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the least crowded in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers to go to the highest in the Olomouc region you will find snow partially discarded.
After the chemical treatment, was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Road operators were the snow during the night; on the road of Šumper accumulated about three centimetres of snow, according to the administrators of tracks.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In most areas of the road of Šumper, remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské you will find snow means discarded in the direction of Jeseník, "confirmed today an operator of the administration of Šumper roads to the Czech.
On the ground and night went to the Jesenická also their colleagues and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest zones are now cleared and wet.
On the road of Olomouc roads are passable without restrictions, of Šternberská drivers should lead with caution in the forest tracts, where roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The operators of the roads in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in various sections in the early morning.
Apart from some places in the snow or ice cream, according to the database of the police the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so that the ice and snow obviously remain in the roadway. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Massif Central Czech, there are no problems and roads, generally, are dry.
By the mmento there have been no complications of service.
Operators of roads have been alerted to the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.

From the open road have been announced unfavourable conditions in the road I / 13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by the branches of trees that had been arched over the path with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want accumulating positive energy
It is said that in less than a month will reach the end of the world, what is your view on this?
It is only one among so many other news alarmist to which we like maintaining.
The group of music The tap tap we like rather make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that wins enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
In addition, in December organizáis a project really original: Three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It is a charity event state that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to exploit the potential of marketing with the end of the Mayan calendar phrasing to 21 December at 11: 10 a.m..
The previous day, on 20 December, at 9 p.m., we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time in which the Mayan calendar ends in Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to collect enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in the world that we will leave to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of articles: Boots, shirts, bags and original sticks against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another form of support.
The group The tap tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the hymn called against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled."
It is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the charity concerts?
Of course we do, and will be just the latest, well, always good and not the world...
The sung all the interpreters at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other at the same time thanks to the special broadcast live at Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák wrote the lyrics of the song and interprets the leading role of Jesus in the clip, which also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration?
We work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organize many charitable and concerts...
We put all our effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in working with amused them and us.
What will the money raised in concerts at the end of the world?
To equipment for the educational institution without barriers Studeo, we have undertaken in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Pupils of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with the active fun and interesting.
Pupils do not have adequate means of paying teachers and do a efuerzo to make this possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert act several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support, Lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchy.
For more detailed information, please consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have planned any other action "spectacular" similar in the future?
In May we will act in the festival for the first time Pražské bird, so here you prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and in Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, until now ye have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and the organization of these trips?
It is not so difficult how may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and moreover we carry much weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now we managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently went very smoothly.
Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What you have found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here in Russia; we have seen that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not often that a person moves single through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
So commonplace as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, it has created a civil association that strives to focus attention problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas we must follow the lead of more advanced countries?
There are many areas in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the development and improvement of the situation also depend on those that are directly affected.
In London and Madrid is very normal for people with severe disabilities travels through your account in public and can go at the service, the museum, wherever...
But it is not very common for a large number of persons with disabilities to participate in social life actively in this aspect, with The Tap Tap just go a little ahead!
A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in the emerging eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything really.
Until now, are isolated cases of people who have a large force of will.
The group The tap tap is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what I took to be the group in 1998?
I like educator in Jedličkův ústav, where he had a lot of young people around me who wanted to engage in something.
And since I am musician, playing, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a business partner.
And over time, as our CM Láďa Angelovič, we were a little hands (laughs).
However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us very connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that cannot be seen, is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we have also quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Do you had to go so far with The tap tap?
From the beginning, I saw the potential that had, that something can be done differently.
The entertainment world is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in their own way, all new is cautiously and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The tap tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who see us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not neglected ones experiencing and of those who should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that provides the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well them to persons with disabilities, then, is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.
Do Ayudó the fact that you are a demanding boss, as she describes many people?
If we want to do an excellent job, we must be rigorous in many respects and that some discipline.
I think it is quite normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with his head in the clouds and when they hear that they must come two days to test, go to the preparatory test and spend much time travelling and concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in each group who want to work and achieve something.
Currently the group The tap tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are a group open, people move in and out, cannot be avoided.
Who will always friendly and open doors
The day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno and Fléda Plynojem in Ostrava and participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected to the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the group The tap tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The objective of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance equipment of multifunctional school without barriers STUDEO Jedličkův ústav in Prague, costing 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry to the option of advance sales in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week accepted Poland as the twelfth member of ESA. Is the second country ESA member Bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland launched an intense cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the commission of projects of the agency.
However, the path of Poland to the cosmos started much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights into space before the Second World War, though not always understood their work.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld astronomical observatory in the Warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented their ideas about the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born the 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld scored in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for its "Introduction to cosmonautics."
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), above, was later established in a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
Hundreds of published articles in journals Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became an advocate of cosmonautics, was known around the world and its contribution to the science was rewarded when he started his name to one of the craters of the dark side of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it was not known who was the author of the proposal and not know details of the project.
It is not clear if the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresina or braking.
The information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Starting in 1933 Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it is evident that the investigation led to the stadium of the tests in practice.
However, with the arrival of German troops, was halted the investigation.
In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a hunting missile photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "- Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza," the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of motors for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the Advisory Committee (provisional scientific Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of techniques of missiles for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dealing with cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy reference is made for the first time to society with four articles very extensive engaged in astronautics.
In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time had already been implemented projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the investigation was a cosmic discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He served in this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket which was conducted scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1.8 meters, about 80 cm in length and there were no more than 5 kg.
Later, he completed the version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 began testing of aerial rockets RM-2 of two stages in the desert of Błędów.
The rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed about 11.5 kg
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of scientific study right. The rocket RM-34 would have a height of 14.5 km and his mission would control the wind in height.
However, in 1962, suspended the work.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor rocket-1, which was built for the 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a rocket of two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial 32.5 kg weight
Developed three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed among themselves for the space available to scientists.
In the rocket Meteor-1A space available for the volume was 0.4 litres in the Meteor-1B of 34 litres and the Meteor-Fengyun 1C of 0.62 litres.
The peak maximum in the three types was 37 km
Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute the Meteor rocket-2, whose first tests air began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km in height.
Then built the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
There is also the entry of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation of cosmic space on Artificial Soviets and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court suspended the law traabajos social.
The decision sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course it will be interesting to examine the current problem from a wider point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Accordingly, this means that the various forms of economic and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The case is in the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital and unlimited private, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the major differences in the cost of labour (wages) produces economic stress.
Under this heading is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this cause "bajadda" in the price of competitor with the aim of taking the bulk of the market and thus increase their profit margin.
On a large scale means, for the majority of employers, shifting production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and, with it, nor is it responsible for this phenomenon, generates unemployment grows necessarily social spending of the state.
This whole situation conducive to the total lack of employers to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social harm that have brought in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to submit specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective to artificially reduce the social status of the population and, thus, attract foreign capital to the country.
Put another way, governments are private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes of existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the making of private capital, particularly with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, by the system of financial liability in the event of unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty coupled with the rise of the differences between rich and poor.
For a number of years, exist in Germany points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot keep up with his own work.
The number of people receiving such aid is already the million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a case not uncommon: Employed persons with a salary so low that the state should pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
It was a scandal of this type related to the situation of the employees of the German federal parliament.
Saving measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU lead, no doubt, to the same situation. People, under pressure from a huge decline of their social status, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to eke out a living with a dismal wage on the edge of society, in the hope that one day the country capital private investor.
Is it necessary to preguntrarse where does it come from?
In the case in question of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptian or African continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to lead the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control.
Below, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence with his selfishness in the political march and thus throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and pervasive in all states.
The result is a hopeless situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is the following: Government ministries, lack of financial resources, commissioned drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked with industry.
This type of bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal approach are quickly in a situation that describes how the Appiános in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in times of César and Pompeii: "The state took time disintegrating and administrations were in force."
In exchange for bribes, favours obtained unlawfully and aid to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption continued unimpeded and the people went to the polls to vote in advance apalabrado "..." had not people with nature that wanted to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls "..." Esprit to speak seriously that the only remedy for a situation as serious was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man strong "... Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, César came to power and transformed democracy forever in autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way that in ancient times, is that the current society is based on preferences, careless of the individual benefits without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as that of then, a decline of the elite without precedent, without a effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should be sought, therefore, in unbridled liberalisation of the economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a kind of liberal democracy, as a pause defined, awaiting the next hit.
The fact is that the elite really devastating current completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent.
The suspension of the law on public procurements is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social status of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is to concrete, political reforms that strengthen the participation of both the state capital as the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (There is nothing of violence and nothing could do so), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let 's do not forget how fragile we are" (let us not forget how fragile that we are).
"If my children did not want to wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right of self and encasilla Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and discrediting Israel of state terrorism.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of today of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who profit from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated on the basis of the Balfour Declaration of 1917) in November in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are based on historical facts, others in conclusions I arrived on the basis of my own way to understand the matter, about who or what group of people is the prime mover of the events in modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
In each time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is not so clear is if were always these characters the directing their steps autonomously or if behind his throne had someone guiding their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth in the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, it has not been possible to arrive within a single generation.
Among these families astronomically rich highlights a that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule that out): The Rothschild.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to cease associating his name with criminal acts of great seriousness. The power and wealth, or both, they covered the shoulders, which always meant a strengthening.
Have a major share in almost all the world ’ s central banks and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack in Iraq were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime, Russia has made the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Civil War to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF to have triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Its quest for global power took over the years 1859 - 1871 to develop a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, awarded the degree 33.
The first war aimed to remove the large states monarchists throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the population of the land between half a million and one billion people (similar amount of slaves to their welfare and luxury and would not be sufficient resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method by which operates the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, follows the dynamic of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order ab Dai - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and have always a worsening situation. If not, it suffices to recall that the EDF was created to avoid a crisis such as the 1907.
So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the throne austro-Hungarian, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the First World War, vandalized tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended so sudden and unjustified militarily and economically, the capitulation of Germany (wars to finish with Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground of the Second World War, allowed bankers and political development, covertly, a conflict situation following the enormous repairs of war imposed on Germany, thus setting the optimum conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, were not satisfied with the Germans for the solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and drew guilty, and build after a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority who should represent and represented as well as the fifth column, that lit the flame and led to the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild fostered the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflict with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of the Second World War: It is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope to which they were bound international bankers in a principle or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jewry in the concentration camps created optimum conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the State of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers were initiated, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, become victim in the front line of combat, now with the population generally Arab or Muslim Middle East.
Israel is a laboratory immense, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of his country, but also internationally. Take, for example, how are divided so sharp supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present candidates in the election.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, which makes every effort to wage war on Iran, and considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where the 20 per cent of the entire global oil (the corridor navigation has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light were now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All I need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the affluent financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual he implements a chip birth controls all his being.
"And obligates all, large and small, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or in the forehead, not being able to buy or sell, not to be bearing the name of this monster or figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: Who has two fingers, which reduces the numbers of this monster.
The number brand to the person and this number is six hundred sixty and six ".
Film: If Argo is raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of the manifestation of Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was going to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution, he fled to the US, which had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: Throw the Shah overboard he could not be allowed, since, if he did, jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the formation of the theocratic regime, was not available to them.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which has since been further intensified with the failed attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator.
In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
Failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter faced Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film "Argo" director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which had had a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.
After a difficult journey, ended in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for that helped a story disguised a bizarre: Came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film that examines the location in the country for the filming of an overproduction of science fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan that charted the ex-filtration "expert" Toni Mendez involved the collaboration of Hollywood.
For that lies seem truthful, wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, society of farming had even a real office.
The details of the operation was kept secret for a long time, the film has been done from the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film Affleck is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a political thriller realistic; on the other, called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, deceitful (an example may be the series Ocean 's Eleven).
In the film combine moods. We find on the one hand sequences well documented in Tehran. In the sequence of receivables are photographs emblematic of the time of the events, which were enshrined in the same way in the film; there are many differences in this regard.
On the other, a typical scenes Hollywood both leaner, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration.
And furthermore, scenes of the CIA and other institutions: Men elections that analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career as an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of act has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after "Adiós small, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, is the first film of Affleck in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Similarly, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placing the directors of old films above standards of Hollywood.
And Affleck evidenced in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the movie takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of events true. The opening sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive for its capacity synoptic that, at the same time, conveys the thrill of confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history is a step forward.
Affleck and its partners get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team impostor in the bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the way of cinematic scenes more intriguing.
And manages quite well. Sometimes adds something to the reality: Here is not all so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit following his track become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that emerges from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman has a role very funny as partners of Hollywood, while its characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the film Affleck loses a bit of stroke dramatic, but it is a film that they can continue with moderately interested, evaluate its implementation and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But that collapse, that will be difficult.
As evocation of a true story and as proof of that can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient.
Rules for the inflated balloon, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that every year presented a survey on the bank charges more absurd, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulation or ideas more absurd of the workshop of the EU."
"We came up after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women in leadership positions in the big European companies," explained sure, "said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Between absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court of consolidating the insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were once had a huge head start over better prices in the life insurance because they represent objectively a lower risk.
Incredible other ideas "workshop of the EU may be proposed by the people by the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013 "Nacher, reported.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or guideline shadow the size of cages for laying hens, which has contributed to the substantial increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban has been criticized for using the phrase "spread butter" or the withdrawal of the classic bulb shops.
A banana quality must have a length of 14 centimetres.
The apparatus of the Union takes such decisions often under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are defended by any State or group of States (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of the veto, claims the demands of their banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 centimetres and could not submit "abnormal bends."
The European Commission is defended by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national standards not homogenized to date, that only complicate their marketing.
The rules that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive carries a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the US last year that in inflatable balloons marketed is obligatory warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to puffing them up without adult supervision.
The US referred here to an American study whereby, when there is talk of toys, the balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
It is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years.
Strange occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: Anyone who has any formal role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. Not to injure the sensitivity of Greece, it must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists: Let, nominated in the survey, between some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU identified the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic, for example, surpassed the established for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of fine substantial.
The organizers of the survey also were interested to the occurrence of pay for those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas not emerged in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact of not having sea.
We call on the European Union compensation, "stated in the autumn of 2004 the then minister of agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
He argued with the fact that in our country occurred much grain and, as a result of the shop calls for intervention, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission had been prepared to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of the grain of countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities for the ministry for local development led by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is aimed at the drafting of applications for grants of Brussels.
EU: Prescriptions are a rare exception
The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to some experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for instance, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have achieved in negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs also have a chord, in the same way as other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with German and Austrian successfully defended the designation of origin of Ricotta of Olomouc, but had to change the name to the rum, whose national tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzemák."
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate can be denominated rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official listing of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with the feta cheese and Gorgonzola known throughout the world, the German city of Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already e.g. cookies of Karlovy Vary, carp and Pohořelice Třeboň entitled ‘ and even the variety of hops in Teplice.
As maras protected from the EU, can be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and Karlsbad forest near v Podkrkonoší.
People want to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Mr senator, how did stand for election for president?
This is not to be a senator or president.
If our country was so good, then do not submit my candidacy.
But since I cannot bear to see how it steals in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, increased taxes and the retirement age.
He had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something that I do not like, attempt to come up with a solution to change it.
And as I already have forty years and my candidacy is independent, the only way to change things is to stand as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter has been path to the presidency.
Is it not turning our backs on those who have voted?
Always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate.
Later stated that if elected senator, submit my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the role; the role is the tool that I can make my own ideas.
Why do I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive down to anyone who wants to start a change.
The situation is compounded by the media, which will discredit and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom of lying.
For me it is said to have bribed to journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
We are going to talk about their ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial and thesis criminal accountability of politicians and the declaration of ownership over 20 million.
This should change the law.
As president does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How to resolve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure for the office of Guide recognized as independent work, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: If someone comes with a good proposal, either from the right or left, refused to purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have the greatest potential to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without encasillamientos or dogmas of party, I have the ability to choose something of each party that is best for our country and its implementation.
Is rather a man from the right or left?
From the Czech standpoint, I have the impression that the people I considered more leftist.
For me it is not important, whether it is a bit of a little left or right.
What matters to me is that we are successful.
I do not care if someone is on the right or the left, I would like to add to the people.
Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or DOS and, in the same way, I am against the bad ideas.
A joke when it says that it is capable of populist.
But it is not proving with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you have also certain goals and ideals.
And try to go to them.
There will be those who call populism, but all the proposals that I speak are already operating in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament only remain slogans.
And thus cannot survive in the long term policy.
Or do you believe that if he is going to people and talk to them, will succeed, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other option.
Persuading politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my part to achieve this.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live webcast on television in which would appeal to the leaders of the parliamentary parties that give the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why do not want them.
If there is a strong character that notes the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Consider the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I am just a fan, I am neither a genius or an intellectual.
For my views and ideals attempt seek allies.
I start in politics and attempt to secure the broadest possible support for my programme.
Attempt to take things forward myself, but in the event that it goes well within six years I will leave and return to the private sector.
Sounds a bit as if Okamura out to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that a person does not do anything, that is why I visited a number of known personalities, for if you encouraging present his candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because I had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed frauds with light oils heating.
I tabled on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted to representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to bring about change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Looking to form his own party?
I have not yet considered because I do not have time to do so, to check the unblemished past of each of the potential members of the party, nor have money.
I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my account transparent only CZK 20,000.
Would it not have money?
Talk of statements of the property, how is it?
I think my private property in some 60 million.
In Prague I have a ground worth 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another floor appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, he was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against the wickedness and injustices.
Do Conduce an Aston Martin, their property is worth 60 million and has no money to the campaign?
You said that you want to change the republic but is not to put too much money on their side.
It is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to endeudarme?
In the campaign have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that has no sponsor demonstrates that there is not much interest in my program.
And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money in my pocket.
The cost of the campaign covered in essence what will I receive salary of senator.
But could not live. For example, could not pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroons a month.
If I just want to make money, then I would.
So that will continue with its business in order to live?
Surely has said before that was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with higher pay.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in spring.
People want to be the Samaritan that saving the republic.
But I also need to live of something.
How much usually win monthly as entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still gaining.
If he were president, then would leave the business.

The architectural firm MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only on the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think that the building is fun, futuristic looks, and finally there is something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a bystander that passes through the streets.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, said: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and electronic books.
No one comes to taste these libraries outmoded, right?
Spijkenisse, a city bedroom located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having risen to a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the lowest literacy rate of the Netherlands.
To counter this situation so shameful, some years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general culture and copy the seven bridges that are represented in the fictitious euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated.
The success of the offensive education was limited.
And so it was as political leaders decided that there was only a chance to improve statistics: Had to build a library!
Winy Maas, the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV, a teacher in the art of the bar diagrams and responsible for buildings funny as well as cynical, took the issue with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around it and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the words: "My dear fellow citizens!
Here you have, my proposal to the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'. "
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million stands on the runway.
It is part of the project of revitalization, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and attached.
In early November, the mountain of books second prize was awarded the "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is also nominated to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012."
In this way, the small town without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian zone postmodern and a council unbelievably ugly after whose white facade one intuiría rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first cultural public building in its history.
The long road until the book
The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is a lift that transports us right at the centre of the massif, but the true lovers of space and reading does not use it, preferring merged with topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The interior completely glazed is bright and easy to appreciate at a glance, the brick floor annealing and the elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public library.
The urban environment is perfect.
To raise the view you can get to visualize the banks of the park, dogs and children playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and the centre opens an enormous dark room that generally tends to be something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is upside down the classic spatial configuration and draw the reading of the interior abroad.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: In the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, the centre of environmental education and the maintenance.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves lining the duties and balustrade parapet wall, at the same time.
The look, the feel and smell are strangers.
Even the architects and engineers more civilians a day shake their heads when they hear about this material unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, on a farm Friesland, we come up against the byproduct suitable from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands plastic fabric used a few millimetres thick as a basis to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded.
For the library that fabric prensó, for the first time in such numbers, to get plates of four centimetres thick.
With the heat and pressure, the agricultural (plastic chair) changes colour and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and collectible sport.
After 105 steps you get to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 metres around the mountain awaits us the reward: From the cafeteria is not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy tasty croquettes and their Dutch ficus planted in enormous pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere to the couple who have the atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations to a new soul
"Believe it or not given their large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books is situated under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden cerchas located in respect across the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorbed most of the rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a thing of electric blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker of IT, already has dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, she describes the "Boekenberg" soul "as the late" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration held a couple of weeks ago, he invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of his private collection.
In this way is to fill the gaps, for the moment, optical a library that still does not have its complete archive; currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has a meaning.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have some link to this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although only there to decorate.
In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in this discipline that reigns in the specialized jargon is known as "creation of an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young and uneducated that can be.
Finally a starting point for shaping their identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a leading role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, US relations expert UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany intimated that he would vote against the proposal to give the Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.
However, finally Berlin abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware.
But at the same time I believe that it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the question was to establish a zone of prohibition of flight.
This has been declared finally by NATO.
Do you find it difficult to Germany take a clear stand when major international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because at the moment is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And making it even more difficult things is that Europeans do not have a coherent policy and uniform.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think we are still feeling what its role, but have already on the road to a foreign policy "normal".
A foreign policy similar to the countries like France or Britain.
What does specifically a foreign policy "normal" from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is ready to defend different positions in the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany should protect their interests.
Are these economic interests have influenced the position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf.
For this reason has to be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not lead to any such importance because it is not a wholly unilateral relationship.
However, it played a key role in German considerations.
Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a large degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps this Germany managed to win a certain respect.
After all, this has only show that is a country that taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US has shown clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities owing to US domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding for the European position.
But, because of the political situation that live here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public that position.
I believe that the real divergence of views is not actually the scale attached to it.
If we look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops.
Do you find it difficult to Germany to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major partners in the EU, on the other?
I believe that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a consistent and coherent European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, do not have the possibility of being part of an upper body, but should also promote things from its own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether simply for the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a thorny issue.
But I believe that the Germans have clear that should play the role of independent figure.
Could we cite Germany itself in the role of important international player? Does in fact Germany assume a leading role?
Or perhaps still finds it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet accustomed, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as a key player, occur certain feelings flat hierarchies.
It is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies.
Seen this way, Germany is in a much more difficult for the United States.
It must show a receptive to the different neighbours and opinions and that it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics ever dwindling, but the EU does not cover of time that gap, who is then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a leading role.
Even if they do not like, if it is unpleasant or if you become a people even more unpopular, c 'est la vie!

"Protection" brand in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known globally and Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the real epónimos fail to file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will give the right.
"To foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.
Each week comes to my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada is Prada-Kny.
German companies also copied legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive in which keeps seats of the office of brands of Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company requested register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that artificial also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that copying and violating the rights of intellectual property is well known.
In the big cities there are department stores of several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting.
However, cases of Pattloch are other. On behalf of his clients, he fight against the fact that the office of brands officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or brand.
The word originates in the Chinese term "Bang," Dakuan
That refers to women who have "fish" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is bad for business, we must combat it," requires Pattloch.
"The brand makes waters, the monopoly position disappears and the harm suffered by the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors affected millionaires, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data of the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is in size, the third market for luxury items and the growing faster.
However, to achieve the cancellation of registration of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and there is a lot of money.
The processes can extend up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because he had spent so much time that the name of the demand had already become a reality "market".
"If the claimant is bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to plagiador because the process has harmed the brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery maker SANY, the company that has been taken over recently by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese may continue to use an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes.
The buyer for Volvo, Geely, used initially a blue and white logo that he remembered largely to BMW; the matter was litigated in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The lost Lacoste clothing manufacturer in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The office of brands CTMO in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the emergency work reverted to normal."
In this way, the number of processes of claim without process has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fight it costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third higher than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads for the tenth consecutive year, the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the office of brands.
It seems that this also applies to the number of logos valid, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011 were bagging 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fight it costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group fighting in court against a copier Chinese.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of car parts of imitation,
The copier has succeeded in securing rights on the Chinese brand Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The office of brands CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the Münchners.
In the following two bodies have given the right to Freudenberg, but the opposing party is fighting today.
We must be extremely cautious
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where he is still pending.
Wentzler hoped to resolved the issue and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, also claims that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the file business has had to revise files up to 100 years old to give evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a six figure sum "euro" with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East threatens to affect Europe,
Specifically whether the imitators ensured there unprotected trademark rights.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
Some time ago that the group left the commercial sphere, but managed to prevent the registration.
"We have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies to be extremely careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international human rights law brand, but what we have to do is register "also in China anything that might be capable of protection", as Wentzler.
Otherwise, the topic may be much more expensive than a simple registration.
Indeed, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay the other party licence fees for its own name, as explains Wentzler.
That or in the segment in question we would be removed from the market.
World day for the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg tested the choir Imbongi and in Swaziland rejoice AIDS orphans
The story of a link capable of overcoming a lot more than 8.733 kilometres away.
First starts for the dance: Cowboy boots, shoes, basketball shoes had heels and seek the compass on the parquet floors, and find them quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (bass, tenor, alto and soprano), arremolinándose, entorpeciéndose and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, almost threatening to pull out of their cells in trying to bring order with his energetic and gestures.
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi tested a new song.
They have also reached the 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the master of the house.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: The Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some areas.
Aid for
According to an estimate of UNAIDS, the United Nations programme for combating AIDS, worldwide, approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245.000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents to 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
By 15 or 20 euros a month can sponsor a child.
This provision will cover the enrolment of school, the uniform and guarantees one hot meal per day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirista."
In this room nobody knows speak fluently this Bantu language, but sing do.
For ten years, this chorus tested songs in this smooth foreign language sometimes achieves jumping to their place of origin: Southern Africa.
To 8.733 miles away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty per cent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 already have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: The infection rate of AIDS higher and the hopes of living lowest worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population struggled with circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.
More than 40 per cent of the inhabitants of Swaziland are bearers of human immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered this hidden population, but what they saw especially were many children in the streets that were not only of the protection of their parents, but the main thing: Food, clothes and training.
School without title, the possibilities in a poor country are slim.
Initially was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child to school and to enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year after the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" that has since worked professionally of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Between STDs are bacterial origin of syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of origin are the AIDS virus, the human papilloma virus, herpes or hepatitis.
The lice infestation and scabies are among STD transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of adults heterosexual sexually transmitted diseases are commonly used chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, thrush (mushroom) and gonorrhoea.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively limited; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to surveys in Europe, three quarters of all infections occur in young people between 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the human papilloma virus also adds to the most common diseases among youth.
How has evolved the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infections by syphilis doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 for 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
It is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often do not cause cause pain and other symptoms, and therefore was not detected.
How can you protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases also can be transmitted through infected with dirt and by physical contact.
For this reason, the experts recommend regularly medical examinations, especially if it changes with frequency of sexual partner.
If they are diagnosed early, the majority of STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any consequence late.
Through partnerships, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the chorus for his performances throughout Germany, come to raise enough money.
"Overall we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni proud," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the own people Zodwa Dlamini a woman confident and with leadership manages money sent from Germany.
Deals with that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of grandmothers.
The "gogos", as it is called to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof live and ensure that children go to school every day on time and in uniform.
Those who do not have anyone are under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, earning a wage of the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a school of sewing, has built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American ISP health organization, has had many of the inhabitants of the people undergo an HIV test.
This is not something obvious, since, despite the apparent that is this disease throughout the country, usually do not speak openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolute taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of the Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This way of life not formally accepted is largely responsible for the spread so rapid that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless individuals who travel the country from one side to the other and carried wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner free condoms can be achieved, but these are hardly used.
It is another culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. "
To promote cultural exchange, the choir Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember of the apartheid era.
A bus full of white sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but has also succeeded in extracting a couple of tears to some rabid border.
The journey leads them to always Esitjeni, where the singers visit children sponsored.
Despite this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there shines the light", says the people of the place.
And after touring the 8.733 km as the crow flies back to Heidelberg until the rehearsal of the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine the light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Probably the ice cap has a thickness of up to 20 metres.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also ice water, as indicated by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science "."
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently shaded has formed a layer of ice.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick.
The water is presumably of comets or, most likely, of asteroids that in its day clashed against Mercury.
Nobody relates the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help to clarify how have reached the water and other components of the lives of other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
Occasionally send images to Earth: Small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an image taken by the infrared Spitzer telescope shows a family portrait "" in which appear endless generations of stars: The oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the color pink stars "babies."
This region of formation of stars, known as a romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This image of a star tornasolada in extinction was taken by the NASA Spitzer telescope.

The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows attack Trífida located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word "Trífida trifidus" (divided into three), as a dark lines of dust burning divide the heart of this area of stellar formation in three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic Billiards: 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merger was abalanzan one another to complete colliding.
The formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like of abbreviations techniques may refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the attack, Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten to a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that can be found in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiography made by different telescopes.

This group of galaxies known as Arp 273, served by a moment of model for the Hubble Space Telescope of NASA.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This area of stellar formation produces constantly new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Earth, Rosette also arise continuously new star; to 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy as bright with a small black hole still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe could be found on any hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: The most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei use it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer are increasingly depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
This reveals the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Great Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, reaches a diameter of approximately 11 metres.
The disadvantage of this construction is more economical than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas also has an elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively smaller, such capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
"In the" Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that is worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope also can illuminate the infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the E-ELT (European it Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These include two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 metres.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea is planning to build a new telescope with a daunting and diameter mirror of 30 metres.
This is an image of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since the 24 April 1990 sends images of distant galaxies.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 NASA announced that since the start of its mission had been located 1.235 candidate planets.
In the picture are the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of the telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.
Researchers suspect that in the south pole of Mercury also ice.
However, there is no evidence, because the Messenger probe revolves around the globe in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that is the case.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
To the south of Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search of footprints in a country in which the people of 97 years are still considered young.
To the south of Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search of footprints in a country in which the people of 97 years are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves loud noise through the winding road that goes by wooded hills, rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the most southern point of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here are the "talyshi", a town of which it is not that much, apart from the Persian and the Azeri and which are very durable.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a solid perhaps too architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit entirely in a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
For touring the 323 kilometres that separate the two urban centres, there is a need for eight hours because the road is a single direction.
The staggering wealth enjoyed by the country through the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this hidden region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what we need to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we celebrate the Feast of older persons in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of the ILC, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented life of eight dozen talyshis of place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva notes an image in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A child died at the age of 136 years
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate which certifies.
And if we consider that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"Was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to devise a daughter more at the age of 136 years.
Is it wrong then Şirali Müslümov in their age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very elderly people," said Scholz, "even in Sardinia many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age; especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, in a surprisingly common, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why live here in the south, so many elderly?
The tour guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the genes of the special talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause resides in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not appear logical that a diet high in calories of the talyshi, who love the meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, moreover, drink a glass of melted butter, so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the form of natural life which keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
Their 97 years is relatively young to standards for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, moved tirelessly a huge vat of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
Also brincan from one side to the other two children.
In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea serving in a typical vessels with a curved.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the headscarf hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son we discover proud.
I have always wash hair with milk, which is why I never has fallen and has maintained its color.
"I never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
Of has always eaten only what was in their own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life I have not gone ever to make the purchase in a supermarket.
Then we spoke of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the period following the Second World War.
However, all returned to track when the "wanted" father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan on religious affiliation to the figure of the nation, who heads his country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
It remained in power until 2003, when he handed the baton to his son Ilham.
At least older people of Azerbaijan does not know what is poverty.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manats (roughly the same amount in euros) in concept of monthly pension, an amount that can live well, considering the situation here.
And perhaps the son of graying Mirzayeva is right: "In our culture are the most highly respected."
Living in a large family, are beloved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this were not sufficient reason to stay alive many years...
In the Constitution lack the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competing protests in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in the country.
The future constitution, with Sharia law as a basis, it is highly controversial.
Egyptian President indulge in pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, to the people and to God, "said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, Muslims illustrated and the secular.
All of them, until now hopelessly mired in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As explains Mohammed beauty, almost asking forgiveness, has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand theirs "to save the revolution."
However, neither Egyptians or the whole world know very well what this engineer of 61 years with a PhD from the University of Southern California really want to save.
Do you intend to deprived of its power to the judiciary?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a night at 15 hours, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also said that the jurisprudence "is based on the principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean of "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take this vague wording, as well as the margin for manoeuvre that legal, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
This is at least suggesting a new article added: In all matters relating to the sharia check with the University Al-Ashar Islamic institution, the most important of the country with a great power in all Sunni Islam.
It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State had to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote morals and values."
It is a formulation so vague in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of film and literature.
Let me make it clear it is not anything other than censure.
By the way that no article provides explicitly equality between men and women.
However another prohibits offend or defaming the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.
However, it is not clear what is an offence and how must be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits the "insult to the people"
Is it enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to beauty for signature and which, their words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution has become"
Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to defeat the Minutes before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, the third in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and these of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."
Through Twitter followers accused the beauty of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When holding the referendum will go to his palace and derrocaremos", says the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiada", was quoted in the media Egyptians to opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
For its part, the Muslim community well organised appealed to celebrate a counter-demonstration; for if not in Tahrir Square, but after a sentence at the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafis took part in the same to the cry of: "The people demand the implementation of the divine law."
Required to clean up the country "beauty", at the same time that proclaimed: "The Quran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have resulted in a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the supporters of beauty did not want to risk that something like this to happen.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide in the polls what direction should follow the country.
In this regard, it seems that the draft Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced which should actually have lasted until February and including all social forces.
This lawyer for 48 years specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when being held in prison or had to face trial for the dictatorship of Mubarak.
Not because share its ideology, but because for him the Human Rights are indivisible.
For this reason was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' even appears in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."
The expansion of the powers of beauty to the three branches of State made this lawyer resign itself.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, which has made the president is abolishing it," laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
Saeda, also feel abandoned by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are crafting a monster that ye cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: More smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has something to do with his appetite for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of cheese excessively cured.
Put in the midst of a mountain of soccer clothes wet and dirty.
Leave it there a week.
You can then smell the aroma of crippling rakfisk, one of the specialties of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.
Is snowed. The landscape is spectacular and the smell, always present, floats in the air.
The trout in salty rakfisk is that allowed to ferment in water, depending on the smelly that you prefer, until a year.
As obscures and becoming more cold, Norwegians flocking to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to the delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"Eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit of a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the "General of Rakfisk", which is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish is stored in small cubes and sipping a drink large quantities of drink.
"Some people like more than the aquavit rakfisk Havard," says.
The drink can kill the smell.
Pruebo some pieces.
If you can avoid pass near the nose, not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has come a few km by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty ravaged Norway and in which, before the cooling, fish are kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, removed and, obviously with the senses inactive because of the alcohol, eats.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a comprehensive system of social services.
A flow of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until a not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered important, an essential part, although quite smelly, last of Norway.
Dishes are among the most expensive that you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer or a cane sandwich will cost a whopping 10 €($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and most Norwegians like that.
Here people is still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist extreme right that acribilló shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July."
The Norwegians have trouble very much believe that in its quiet country one of theirs was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of the wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970s, one of the oil and gas industries largest in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason that we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while moving trays of rakfisk and that, with his long hair blonde and its striking blue eyes, it depicts the welfare Norwegian.
"We are as you people prudent."
His English, as most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We do not like to boast, we do not like the ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except for a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was dissipating money lacking during the years preceding the financial crisis across the world, Norway maintained the wallet well closed.
"While we can skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk casual," she adds with a laugh.
I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burgers is certainly something quite different and succulent palate.
But by night, this smelly fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many restaurants that marks a dinner of rakfisk where diners voted the best fish, or perhaps the most tests the nostrils.
A live has connected TV presenter who leads with a crane and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It seems the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls of the chair, perhaps defeated by aquavit.
Or perhaps the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of its population.
Trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already in itself has been installed, congested since Monday a siege of steel that cuts several of the main roads leading to the town and which is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not prevent workers to arrive at their place of work, but avoid protesters may come to the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will take over the management of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is in a war against the narcotráfco that has already killed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal."
Prior to rub shoulders with the president of the USA, the prior political experience of Mr. Peña was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A populous state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
An honest man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he remembers fondly.
Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city can be lead by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, a huge improvement compared with cracked roads and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.
You can also see name plates at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope the interesting and real change to our country so desperately needs."
After a continuous period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unseated by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years of age outside the presidential palace at Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations to Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also rejects the characterisation that the opposition is of lack of essence of the new president.
"It is a very honest, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
It is a fantastic man of state and, above all, is a person who knows listen. "
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has many people on his former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as City Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be higher.
Hidden under sections of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the borough are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, have been abandoned in just the past two years the bodies of dozens of women murdered.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the State of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for their violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr Peña Nieto say, at best, which failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critics accuse the administration of turning a blind eye.
In a house of concrete, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buendía must make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes that her partner the murdered.
"When I arrived home, it seemed as if he had cleared the body," recalls Ms Buendía.
"There were signs that had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross which reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family said that he has been denied.
"I state authorities have treated as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica.
What they want is that you simply accept what they say and street. "
"But that may not be the case where there have been so many irregularities and neglect," he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the past six years and the new president has pledged to give them priority during his mandate.
"I hope that this is the same kind of president who was when he was governor," said Congressman PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of victims of Ciudad Neza more fear.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, according to state prosecutors
Prosecutors seek to address the allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning in prison
The trial focuses on the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
The defence wants the case dismissed on the basis that the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The soldier in the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to report maltreatment which now claims that he suffered while in military custody.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning in a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment she received.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted in response to the request of the defence to dismiss the case, given that his detention was hard and that it had been sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he considered suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed ever that Manning was the source of information.
In view of the Friday, Fein revised with Manning forms that officers pad after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was detained in maximum detention regime since July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers have carried out questions to Manning and annotated their answers.
When the Friday Fein enquired about the forms, Manning acknowledged that she had described the treatment given to her by warders as "excellent" and treatment facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no denunciation of mistreatment, although officials asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and indicated that would be addressed, but that they not recorded in the register of these issues.
"Writing 'smooth' (after having spoken of problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked why not Manning had denounced the treatment she received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to discuss the intentions of suicide that had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of "injury prevention" under which he was.
The military said that he had been put under that restrictive regime, which is a level below the surveillance possible suicide, to ensure their protection and safety of other people.
"I wanted the staff knew that I was well and (I) under injury prevention... to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison, located at the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait and that once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that she was not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to the cage," explained Manning on Thursday.
"I thought he was going to die in the cage."
Manning stated that, once transferred from Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said that only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was prohibited to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said that always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said that if guards could not see the face when it gave the return at night, raised him to return to turn round.
The lawyer of Manning presented in January 2011 a formal complaint about the treatment to Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, they forced him during a morning count to stand in front of desdnudo guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never given the opportunity to be filled with the blanket during the recount.
During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said that deducted by the order that gave him the inspector who should drop the blanket with which could have been filled, but acknowledged that nobody had ordered the dropped.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to show an officer that he posed a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that could have used the elastic of his underwear or their flip flops for self harm but did not do so.
Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell their underwear, his flip flops and his glasses.
Their lawyers have the hope that the judge has at least into account experiences that happened during your stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if convicted in the court martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said that plans to do that Manning was found guilty of minor offences and defend other allegations considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and it is expected that prosecutors argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules apply to all detainees under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, provoke illegally the publication of information on the Internet, leakage of information of national defence and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, could face life imprisonment.
My identity crisis Mexican-American
Claims that many were forced to flee Mexico owing to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticise those who left; said reminiscent of Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had fallen on the esplanade and reached the area of processing of immigration and was already totally confused.
Posters showed the way to two lines: One for "Mexican" and one for "Aliens".
I was there a few seconds without being sure where should go.
Having grown up in Central California, all my life I have called "Mexican".
It is shorthand ethnic, in the same way that my friends of Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends of New York define themselves "Italian".
Later I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not needed.
American was simply.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to salir during an interview in this language.
But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and I cannot get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I stood in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at the time this week in which the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always to meet the leaders of these two countries, comprised: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was willing to speak also the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why now is as likely to a Mexican remain in Mexico as they venture to go to the United States.
Wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trading bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue the fight against drug cartels in Mexico, but did not elaborate.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.
Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to assign half its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who believe in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that I recall are everywhere.
So, in the moment in which a United States official said anything involving the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the elite, about how Mexican Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma are up in arms.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that it really is quite a challenge is the with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking of rancour?
There is much.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, persons to whom the country provides opportunities for the other and that is not so.
The only reason that so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, the father or the mother or any of the grandparents, to which he closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to move towards the north.
And most of the time that person fits in with a certain profile: Dark skin, a level of study under, from a poor people, etc.
We are their downward and they are loyal.
Mexico does not.
And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we cannot never lose sight of that what we are seeing is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but it is our loyalty.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class people dislike us.
The feeling is mutual.
We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over his shoulder as if we were of a lower level that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not been gone.
And we would not be caught behind the curtain of silk, living well in the United States but, even so, as solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when she was a girl, I remember that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more who they are and the seconds this resent.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of any of the two.
We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things, so I have heard during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want the work as Mexican-Americans "ambassadors of Mexico" improvised, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our American colleagues awesome visit that country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That is not going to happen.
There is too much rancour.
And, with the wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you are going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still bitter about how his family was treated for a lot less time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps be more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a base unlikely for peace
Can he be some day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that suggests that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in its ongoing conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything made pieces like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that its deadly impasse could desencallarse.
A war that neither is lost or earns
At first glance, the optimism is now very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened the hawks in both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say have forced Israel to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good kicking.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and to pressure the 1.7 million Gaza residents in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to stop Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its unrelenting rival Palestinian faction Fatah, the more moderate.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas could conclude that time is working in their favour.
Since the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power which had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. So has Qatar, one of the richest states and dynamic of the Gulf.
The jubilant members of Hamas say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, where dominates the party-militia Hezbollah and Syria, where the rebels in an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Particularly in the south of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its demise in 2011, was not too long to Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas emerge as protagonist who cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hardliner wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As regards the issue of Hamas military, have put in place.
The Iron Dome missile system of Israel has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
Israelis most peaceful sleep... for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas has initiated the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
While the rockets fired from Gaza killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory contender to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite that, according to international law, are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, the Likud party has joined a group of an even tougher led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period before the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians with their own state?
If you really would govern in the West Bank, as rockets would not have done their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better to have them after this wall and give them a good blow if raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliner wing, while the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Although Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere have too much appreciation to Israel, its priority will be to address the internal difficulties.
The defence budget of Israel is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Start a war with the superpower of the area is unlikely to help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.
The Israelis should think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, deprive Palestinians of their right to self determination involves creating a powder keg that one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a boost of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the sensible people who preach from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which should start to curb the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role with regard to make Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term failed to file its own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, it seems just as reluctant to devote attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases look on green packets of a shutdown, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australian law on smoking and packaging generic, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replacing the logos and colors of markings for a wrapper of a shutdown olive green, a horrifying images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick as children of parents who smoke.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small.
It is the stricter regime of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco.
The federal government of Australia affirms that the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking through the elimination of the traits that make this habit has glamour.
She hoped that studies show that if a person has not started smoking before the 26 years, there is a 99 percent chance that it never will.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, include the message that the company is trying to sell through their brand," said the Federal Minister of Health, domestic violence and homelessness 116 Protecting Indigenous women citing studies that showed, for example, how girls connected the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Despite that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes do not affect too to the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said that the law would encourage the black market of tobacco, cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have severe unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco, in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited following the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for the typical and covered with silicone to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and retailers that was waiting for more stock.
"For us is a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the population sector to which the plan.
After a series of laws that prohibit the Australian television advertising and sponsorship of sports and forcing the majority of vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of tobacco has to be made online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local websites, but cannot restrict cater.
"If comercializas tobacco and only you have this small window to promote your products, the online space more convincing is the place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase of reviews on brands from "ordinary people" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing company is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on which implies a new policy that in marketing.
The industry has even pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recused themselves the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization which is restricting trade unfairly, though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO a decision by mid 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In the year 2001, Canada became the first country to introduced the requirement to include images in the packs.
 Currently are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering applying tougher laws.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs do not affect me.
I simply not case. "
"You take the cigar and guards the package," said Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Frankly, there is only one reason that would stop smoking: For my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack shop in downtown Sydney, indicates that the uniform packets make it more difficult to place them on the shelves.
"Usually took an hour in a desenvalar four slow delivery; now," says Yu.
"The government should be banned completely tobacco and then, is already, it is, is over and we closed the shop", said as she raises his hands upwards.
In a world constantly connected, is not so bad a bit bored
During the festivities in Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I will not lie.
Half day stuck in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there is growing academics and experts in child development that praise the virtues of boredom.
According to them, it is good that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time.
Bored obliges the brain to find interesting options and can encourage creativity.
Given that most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experienced the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept in good spirits boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But, as we will talk about that later.
Firstly, like many people, assumed that, now that we have more time to leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, a vibrant history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of the boredom is very long," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there is graffiti in Latin on boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D.
We also need to consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and raise the idea to a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "hope, but not power, participating in an activity that fills you."
Affirms that the difference between the boredom and apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so.
Notes that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The experience of boredom, says, is "the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."
Boredom may sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are boring tend to see the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed considered that the problem is with them.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, when what is happening in reality is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person who read the article in a magazine.
Some groups heard in the adjacent room a television programme at top volume, unconnected, others heard with the volume low, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear the audio in no time.
The group that heard the program with the volume under showed more boredom than the other two groups; they cost focus, but were not sure why and how attributed to the boredom.
"When trying to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a line of manufacture, a music that distract you can help you do not get bored."
"In fact, we know today that move or scribbles, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help to combat it, as do that person is physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and more information than those on which they are forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is bored at some point: The delay of a plane, a speaker monotonous, a film especially boring.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of trend of boredom."
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, alleges that, using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is bored fairly easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human development and community of the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which contacted 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 per cent of adolescents said that while he was at school or doing their homework, while 23 percent said that when he was not in school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom current, 21 years later, would be above or below.
But he said that what we knew was that "adolescence is a period in which the boredom is at its highest point," largely because both children and adolescents are given a great control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my question the principle: Is good bored?
Sometimes it is not, because taken to extremes, can do that we expose physical risks absurd, as do bets or fall in consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as evidenced by the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between the boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way that the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate.
If you ’ re bored and using that energy to playing the guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you.
But if you see television, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but in the long term.
"So, if your child is boring and you give an iPad, it may no longer be bored, but will not have learned to entertain themselves or dosificarse", says Professor Fenske.
And "this capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations," he says.
Your son not only learn to chew itself, but learns how to be better controlled in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to commend the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him.
Our objective should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of the constant hum of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need more tiresome issue, but boredom is a very distressing and worrying desire to link it with something worth," he says.
Notes that what people really are looking for a way to unwind and enjoy a downtime.
"In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados," says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: Without instructions to the new law on consumption of marijuana
Anthony Orozco, a student of 19 years in an institute community and footballer in southeast Colorado, is facing criminal proceedings for something that will soon be legal in all state: Possession of stones of marijuana and a pipe that used to fumarla.
Orozco said that a day of September, he and some friends led by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related articles (minor offences involving each fined $100 Americans) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco said.
What are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of cases minors for possession of drugs depends less on the law of the location.
Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are cancelling both here and in the state of Washington, where they adopted a similar measure.
Police departments have ceased to bring charges against the older than 21 years for possession on a small scale, that will be adopted legally once the Act has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors of more conservative districts of Colorado has pledged to continue the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent opened shops of marijuana, recently authorized, in their communities.
"All this is changing so rapidly that I do not know what is to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington are also dwelling on the matter.
And continue to seek advice to establish a system of licences of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline, 1 December 2013.
Say that, for better or for worse, Colorado goes ahead of most of the states in the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so this is a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Commission for the control of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions as to what might work.
"There is a real precedent that we serve as a model," he says.
The law of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which is nadará between two stools, as the system of licences in the state still do not exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some mechanical sensitive issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer a "access" to marijuana authorized and its prohibition of doing business of cannabis situated less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds for children or nurseries.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorized in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for cannabis legal, a research group created recently.
On 21 November, Oates, the Chief Constable of Aurora, sent an email to their police officers in the informing them that the prosecutor of the city would bring proceedings for minor offences for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years and that the police would bring charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
The Chief Constable Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the regulations of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute and sellers of drug traffickers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, said that his office would continue to pursue the cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 persons face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, even though many of them have other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to prosecute those offences at the time were crime occurred," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated, even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the county, no longer quotes adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, County district attorney, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I do not think it is wasting time to continue to enforce the law to change," he said.
Despite that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, never considered that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judiciary system would be easy.
Contradictory reactions emerging throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among the staff of the great experiment environmentalist in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with prosecutors of the district," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused for possession of marijuana and that is local voice of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana.
"They have spent so much time taking people before the courts that, in fact, still cannot accept that is legal," he said.
As the first states that they consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become cases of test at the national level with regard to the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and officials of the state have a new frontier of legal sale, also are looking forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still requires consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hopeful that the Department of Justice will subside.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed mostly any business of selling marijuana for such purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 states more.
"Although it is likely that the drug agents not to pull down doors to confiscate a bag of drug small, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, as permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of drug policies of the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado will not wait for acting federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them may open.
Last week, the western town of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and it is likely that the approval of next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what voted in favour of community responses to vote in favour of what voted the state. "
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: "I had to go to Oxford as a Tory"
Do not strike at the university by their views only now
I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming in my seat at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the modern era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: The free thinking and tolerance.
However, the two weeks of taking my place in the Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, had already made the bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and she broke down in tears.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper The Evening Standard said that I had left because he did not tolerate that some fellow university kept sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because they forced me to drink in cups shucked.
The truth was less enjoyable.
I fled there.
Yes, I fled, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my bizarre name, nor the fact that came from a private school.
I harassed by a single reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Perhaps wonder about that now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights of homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students in grade) of Corpus Christi College claim that are often "seriously sections, personally attacked and treated as persona non grata" by their political ideas.
Want to create a post in the committee of equal opportunities of his college to ensure able to express their views freely.
Their situation was prompted by a recent documentary of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: Young, bright, and on the right) on the policy of students and presenting to the Tories as eccentric and neonazi.
It showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the grip of silver.
In other universities, students conservatives say they are treated as "scapegoats" by the introduction of tuition fees higher.
Luke Black, of 20 years and Vice President of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of the left in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know. "
Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi that presented the motion for greater protection, argues that this atmosphere is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 and elected president of OUCA, argues that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of members," she says.
During my first weeks in Oxford was more single that one.
I entered college in September 1986, was a young of 18 terribly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted refuse to Margaret Thatcher, former pupil, an honorary title "after" cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any horror to shudder of Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when new students are known and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I discovered that the professors not only did the blind eye to the mockery of academics conservatives, but participating in it.
The policy of the miners ’ strike, privatization and the government ’ s opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the halls of the seminar.
The first thing that I should be translated into English French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (late), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not di nor a.
Pitt, a man shorty with a face that looked like sponge, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Do the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that are simply stupid?" She asked.
The other is a university.
I burning eyes of tears that sought to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in his free time, provided that it is not too busy knowing people," gruñó Pitt.
I returned to my room like a banshee.
That night I sat alone for dinner at university; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a student of English second year called James presented as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," told me politely.
"I am afraid that this is how it goes the thing.
They pick on anyone suspected of being Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers seeming to be Labour. "
Later, in a local pub, I tried to disguise cowardly.
I emphasized that he did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This trick proved worthless.
A student of first year of Philosophy, Politics and Economics which, paradoxically, she studied at Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of a pig fascist.
You are contaminated. "
Other students took this ditty.
I became the dirty perverted.
"How do have sex the Tories?" Asked one.
"There are beaten, right?"
I felt the same way that should have been homosexuals before the law liberal of the 1960s.
Could one day lead normal lives in Oxford?
Am I obliged to meet people who think like me just after nightfall?
Would that make me Labour and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I hoped were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
Is this to be not only of the Conservative Party, but also an adviser to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
Barely was there.
Hated the place by being parochial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy," I said.
I began to travel daily from Oxford home of my parents in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan mindset more open.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
I am not believed.
When he was a student there in the 1940s, was accepted all political viewpoints.
"But if it is the best place in the world," said with sadness.
"They would never do this, not there between my beloved dreaming spires.
To my friends always had an impeccable Communist attitude. "
Their achy eyes started nublarse.
"Dale another chance.
I am sure that have done so only for joke.
I would split the heart if they desire. "
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had waived his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another Professor of History had intimated, speaking quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Cross shame inside, admití that my parents I had been "brainwashed" and called them "old stupid."
The truce did not last long.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my academic career in Oxford.
Then my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was in interest nestled of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors declined.
When they did the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Perhaps I call weak llorona.
But no one of 18 should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that was Oxford, which not only has trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, behind a deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to the notoriety"
On the occasion of the sample "Valentino: Master of Couture", which has opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host a presentation on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by their "house" over the past 50 years.
"I adore this palace," says with its distinctive Italian accent.
This shows is the culmination of a long history with the sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without honourable clients.
Valentino has always fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, private letters and pictures with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of their upward mobility: From humble city dressmaker Yosef, northern Italy, idol of the "international jet-set".
To be in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least not to shut down the butts of their joints on your magnificent carpet as do some beautiful celebrities of pop music", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a host spectacular and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmujer of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
And yet, is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his flat.
We were twenty people, including were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the flat, decoration, food, music, everything looked and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and kind", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week, in 1995.
"Never goes out of style because their designs are works of art," cap.
Parade of lineage
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but loves well matched.
He loves people with good education and titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty metres long proposed a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models and must paraded through the gateway to accommodate a "dream" hearing that feature masterpieces of Valentino, as clothing that chose Jackie Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool coat and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In that audience of mannequins shimmer names such as cave of Luxembourg, Gloria von German und Taxis, he-Marit of Norway, Rosario Sofia of Bulgaria or Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the dressmaker, in 2006
Many of these clients claim that the first Valentino is as the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "Gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection, 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that I made him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"We prefer to him above others for their femininity, for his great love women, because enhances our beauty," added the former duchess of Fair.
I like the colors that uses, have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and prescriptora fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d 'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time I visited a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, dreamed of getting to the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of their costumes at night...
Finally it came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for use at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirt of blowing, "corsage" drapery and décolleté word of honour.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d 'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D 'Arenberg keeps his clothes "party of the dressmaker with care... because a dress is not only a dress, also is the set of memories that entails."
The "king" fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in your wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as calls the dressmaker to their seamstresses) to develop the ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four and a half metres.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, titular of the specialised press that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
For years with the "Obnubilado moved-être" of the elite, Valentino is your best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Ms. Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.
"I have been struck by the refinement, its calm, its aspect spotlessly clean and perfect," acknowledges D 'Arenberg.
The last time I saw was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was in the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"I was impeccable, the time is not for him."
If it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: The human mules of Kawah Ijen
By four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano is risking their life and health carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur through steep trails of stone
There are people for his job is hell and another that literally works in hell.
In the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living taking Kawah Ijen volcano sulphur, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to download each day until the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies to come into contact with air.
After booting large rocks of sulphur, which in total come despite some 70 kilograms, mould in two baskets of bamboo that burden on your shoulders through steep trails of stone.
Are just 250 meters until the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes in promotion at a snail ’ s pace, keeping the balance and measuring their tracks to be careful and not resbalarse fall over the precipice.
They know that any traspié could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist despeñó years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
Miners Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur mining
Once up, alongside the tourists that the photograph as if they were monkeys, circus and charging fatigosamente heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, to 1,850 meters of height.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits the volcano since 1960 this time their workers, who pays 662 Rupiah (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Later sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder the sugar.
"As usual is load 70 kilograms, 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) in each trip," explains Anto, who usually three doors per day.
It takes three hours in each and just ground, but allow you to combine 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, is triple what would gain in the field.
"The hire of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the coalface was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is just as forceful as sulphur: "I married with a young woman of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java for that will convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously and irritate the eyes by toxic gases
To his 27 years, Anto takes three playing his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pass bill despite wearing a mask and special glasses.
Has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously and irritate the eyes by toxic gases that oozes the volcano.
Is the price to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work two years because I want to open a store or studying Spanish or French," promised in an English more acceptable.
Punished by life, this young intelligent and agreeable could be tour guide, waiter or a hotel receptionist, but rather that was the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wood cabin with carriers, gets up every day to the two a.m. because sulphur is flowing at night, when its characteristic blue and yellow becomes shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto drops to crater alumbrándose with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he has bought with their money.
Some 400 porters load baskets of sulphur on his shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite their enormous profits, the mining company has not mechanized mining of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to carriers, working on their own and to both the weight.
Indeed, even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of surcharge for camera that, next to the entrance of Rs 15,000 (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for people," protest Madrusin, a burly carrier of 42 years of his Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that abide working "everything" because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years.
I am not retire, I will die a here because the volcano has been all my life
Although sulphur burning throat and rankles the eyes when the wind changed unexpectedly and traps miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, are so tough that none complains of suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, of its usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knee and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balanceando the basket on her back, Unainik already can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years.
Every day, he and his fellow start 15 tonnes of sulphur to the volcano, three trucks moved to Tamansari warehouse, 18 miles away on a path of goats in the bush.
"I retire, I will die a here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where lacks several teeth.
Of their five children, the largest, 30, is also carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but the misery perpetuated from generation to generation, one of the harshest in the world: The human mules that make the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks to babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a husband patriotic, you are my wife patriotic, we fulfil our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an announcement of pills of mint, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references as "We will put a Bao (bun) in the oven for" laugh at the birth rate of Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement to draw attention to the problem of a fun.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of the music to the people complies with "his national duty."
This is purely Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that had to be addressed.
We knew that the government had tried to many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings of appointments (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not do the most creative effort to resolve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
That would not do so lightly is the Government of Singapore.
Spent $1,300 per year in policies to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government to marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was above 2 - known as reposición- rate was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans have no more children?
So Wei Ming, Director of Policy on Marriage and Family of the National Population Division, said that is because of a "better education" and "a broader range of opportunities for career."
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals, priorities and beyond to marry and start a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase of spinsterhood, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to dramatically increase immigration to deal with the decrease in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites with abundant xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical for maintaining low wages and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the governing party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with fees and levies higher for foreign workers.
Unintended consequences
While the fall in the birth rate is known in economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also taking some unintended consequences.
The government is trying not to be built so many maisonettes.
For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authority of urban development has grown to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box," could be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of celibacy and discourage developers who want to build big houses, family.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, said that its "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the larger units.
Are more popular in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the birth rate, to speak with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of central seems that will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing", said a young executive.
Others may have children.
"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to make babies, Singaporeans are those who have the last word.
The private off line is private online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy is the quality of private or "the scope of private life that has the right to protect any interference."
What is privately for a child under 16 years?
How true this definition in their daily lives and in social networks?
Does the dangers faced by venting on the Internet situations that surely not shared outside line?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years for the network.
In four cases, with the term "something very own", on a personal level, and "in the key and user name", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets not to a post," said Jorge, of ten years, when you try to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which has accounts for two years.
"They are very secrets secret, my mom can meet them, but not everybody," she says.
FB I go in beautiful images or games.
I also I with my acquaintances.
"Not shared a photo that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that is wrong publish obscene photographs of naked people, of crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures meet the 35 friends in FB and its nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to speak and write tweets interesting.
"I do not know if I answered, I only get," she adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly," he says.
Do not hesitate to say that would never accept a request for an unknown person.
Nor would case someone to recommend to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, of 14 years, is different.
The teenager has accounts with Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last admits not meet 20 people added in its list of friends.
"I am not afraid of, because we have something in common, music by example," says.
According to the boy, neither he nor has hinted he has asked the address of your home or your telephone number.
"If I press or as required by simply the sack of my mind," acknowledges.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy he is no stranger to the experiences of what today is known as ciberbullying.
To an acquaintance of a my friend were extorting in a social network.
Threatened him and demanded money.
"Never knew who I was," he says.
The victim, according to José, not closed the account.
He was only "privacy".
Then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike George, this guy would drive up photos of known in awkward situations or embarrassing.
It would, if I fall ill or his desire.
"Although I know that that is ciberbullying," she says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and graduated in Education and Learning, considers that to guide to children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is reporting.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game," mentioned.
Batons notes that the academic Marc Prensky, Master of Arts in Education at Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined the terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we need to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
Says that the issue is complex, "because we are calling for them to have a definite attitude about what or not distribute, publish or tell an age that maturity does not provide for that."
"That are also targeted when what matters is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do so is not," he added.
Below, Porras enumerates options: There are things that are not contarías to a stranger, why you do on the Internet?
Or, do you want to publish a photo of yourself as you published a friend?
Do you know what the other published on you?
When labels photos of parties, would permit Quinceañera style to the others to label them?
And one more, do all they need to know what you ’ re doing every moment?
Another point is signalling that should act as they do online off line.
Are the same rules.
"One outside Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be in social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor and consultant, professor of primary education, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly policies of social networks.
To understand each of subparagraphs they have solid foundations to talk with your children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guard, is key to remind children from "do not talk to strangers."
Ends summit of the Unasur without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without issued the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven trustees assistants.
EFE tried repeatedly access the document signed in the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and President stated at the outset that they were going to deliver after the closure, but later claimed that at some point will be posted on the website of the Peruvian Government.
To be consulted by the text, noted that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press.
Access to information by journalists of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only aired in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private meeting, audio restricted."
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the spokespersons of the press of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the event, but not the Peruvian.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents assistants, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for further information.
Subsequently, the President of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
In October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being required insistently by the press, nor the also called Declaration of Lima that had previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the paper was published on Tuesday.
In both international events, the Peruvian authorities had endeavoured to which insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited the maximum benefit from information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court at The Hague to settle a dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional and affirmed that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to listen to the arguments on both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We shall abide by and execute the judgment that defines the differences that today we are taking this international court," said Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that is respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, of treaties and international courts," added Piñera, and saluted with a handshake to Humala, together with the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of both presidents that shall be put to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week the Pact of Bogotá for which had agreed to submit to the findings of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua considered seriously wrong.
The summit was conducted with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, Bolivia; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay suspended from Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and close the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The trustee read the final document in which he reported that adopted 16 agreements and set the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted mentioned that the UNASUR countries will "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending agreements on residence."
Reported that promote actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to facilitate access to medicines, the internet access at low prices in every corner of South America, and care together and efficient natural hazards."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not be a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand Our productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our people," added Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... joining our countries and generating new economic networks," said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among these projects, mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the underlying themes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a closer connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details.
Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country for its return to the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America remains as a region of peace and prosperity, integrated, and of good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before embarking on their participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with its pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat with respect the maritime controversy after a judgement of the ICJ, challenged by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these roads, are not mutually exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be on Saturday in Mexico where plans to attend taking command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Ministers of Defence bloc met previously to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrated UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru has the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship:" Rafael Correa
The president, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now are practically a homeland."
Defended the project to establish the citizens of South America that encourage countries members of the Unasur.
"We must get the free movement of citizens and workers by any servants, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the states Anglo Saxons and taking into account those who have signed the pact of San José on human rights.
The Chair who never undertake to nothing and, instead, we all signed the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Commission Interamericana de Derechos Humanos in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said that is not repented of that decision because it has not betrayed their principles, but has respected its "profound democratic values and human rights."
He added that, in its time, "had suspected that Assange was extradited to a third country and does not respect for his process."
He criticized, moreover, to the Swedish justice by demand submitted in its territory the questioning by an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation allows met through videoconference, that could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk of a deterioration in the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since that is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that I had a small problem lung, nothing serious," said the representative of Ecuador.
There is a danger that deteriorates your physical and mental health to be confined in a small space, without being able to do outdoor exercise.
"It complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been discussions with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with rights, that word does not use it in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because counsel of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European bodies," said.
And suggested that "if Britain is just the pass this morning."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitting its legislation and as he has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interviewing via Skype tomorrow just this problem.
Correa used to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and emphasized that it is "not tolerate mediocrity, the bad faith and lies, that detract from the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians evil and evil but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard was pleased that are no longer these journalists "or bankers or hegemonic countries and bourgeois which dominate in Ecuador," and said it "to be reelected refining revolution to continue the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, to argue that the agency "must be firm and does not tolerate opportunism and the legality of coated" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, perfectly "relevant" to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now maritime boundary between the two countries after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment is not to comply with the judgement.
It is a problem between a South American country and one in Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to come together.
We must try them broadly to overcome them and move forward.
Also relied on a successful conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept that it is hard for judgement."
In reference to the possibility that stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term noted that sees that possibility "with optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."
Correa said that if it loses the elections of February 2013 will be removed from public life.
Personally I have never interested power, but in situations as unfair as the socioeconomic of Ecuador that poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My movement (believed it was I who ensured that likely victory, because we must accept that disconnected players regardless," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and hence we go out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It is a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of health of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that travelled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"Does not mean a return to the state of health of President Chávez," he said.
The head of State of Ecuador participate today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio had 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I was a bomb", refers to relive the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to do "more suavecito", without clear success.
The boy he hid his family.
Decided to take only of his illness and began to enquire about it; with such an endeavour that already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest of the patients HIV Unit Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Until then, the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided bidding him because he had a "cut".
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, still many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least for the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at the moment that the survival of a patient who began treatment in a timely and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
Infectólogo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system of patients to initiate the diagnosis, with better anticipation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years ago, when provide 500 CD4.
In simple terms, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive to the 25 years of age, under these terms "while kept under control can live without problems until the 75 years," explained the interviewee.
To measure this development, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
 - Why deaths remain?
 - I think that the problem is not of access to treatment.
They view, this has happened in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years have not been desabasto of medicine the problem is that patients are well advanced because they are unaware of their condition of infection, or, in the latter stages of the disease.
Gave a striking statistic: "Nine out of ten patients when they are already an opportunistic infection, what you have to do to have a greater impact on mortality is global, more diagnoses early and, therefore, we have to offer testing massively, to all persons who apply."
In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who turned out to be tested in a laboratory particular only motivated because it had a friend and, despite their young age, was already in stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi ’ s sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is a common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going to die and are not interested.
"If I am going to die, better I reviento three times a week, say" not in my case.
The change was to improve, I food well, I exercise, I take medicines.
To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone.
"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have a sexually active, but shares, I care to me and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with GOALS WORK to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
Testing, if had risk, that between soon know whether they are HIV positive, and it is best if they already have the diagnosis, learn that can live as anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarized the motto of battle AIDS this 2012.
Condoms after the counter
Great are the gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, journalist Tapatío who has taken the case about HIV.
And the greatest is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is fine but there are those who today, yet, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What the you?" Asked is common, with derision and value judgements of social workers, counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, which does not want to expose adolescents, assured the communicator.
Proposed redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only after the counters and those 100 are in our public baths of sites frequented by young people.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
Nor it is paying the chelas and the motel, as did the governor Emilio Gonzalez, to ask whether distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, the best thing is to bring the condoms to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is fourth place nationally in new cases and 13 ° cumulative AIDS and HIV.
92 per cent of infections corresponds to the sexually, 6 per cent to the blood and 2 per cent to the perinatal transmission.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV as by a case registered about 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by an appeals court in the United States a ruling that he is unaware of the restructuring of the debt of the Grupo Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the stage is a harmful precedent for any company national ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would seem, therefore, that the procedures in support of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
At a practical level, the boost to the judgement issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies in the northern district of Texas, left helpless to Mexican signatures for the seizure of their property in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main manufacturer of glass in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
For a start, while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the Bankruptcy Law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings is the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would ignore the procedural cooperation in international insolvency cases of companies with transnational profile.
Indeed, towards this end, created the United Nations Model Law to Uniformity of International Trade Law, and arbitrator the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling states that without the vote inter-company, recognized in the critical mass of commercial debts owed to its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, was not reached the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility the recognize Mexican laws.
Indeed, the Vitro has not been the first case in which accepts the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts inter-company endorsed the Federal Institute of Insolvency.
The truth is, moreover, that subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have been majority.
The vote was 45 percent to 37.
The figure omits the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, it blames Vitro of the difficult situation faced by from 2008 to circumvention of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, where the barbs the country.
For one, the signing of the family Gonzalez Sada lodged an application for reconsideration before the court of appeals to the vote comes to full of it, that is to say the five judges, given that only voted three.
He does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the process of review by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the court ignored a document submitted by the Government of Mexico in the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Ley de Concursos Mercantiles, noting that this case involving in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to match it with Chapter 15 of the Law of bankruptcies of the United States.
Moreover, it states that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for transboundary cases of insolvency, guaranteeing fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two French bands: They attack Vitro and hit them to the country.
Balance Sheet
Asleep for several months complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación exdueño against the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association mondiale aviators has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau just presented a criminal suit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has steadfastly refused to provide reports to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation by the employer to extract of the trust F / 589 IXE Bank, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.

As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the chain of hotels Posadas.
Nearby, the Dragon Mart
Gathered at the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of environmentalists and foreign nationals, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Dragon Mart Chinese in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, a colossal centre for sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with an area of housing at the bottom for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the area of southeast to oppose the monumental subjects that swept through part of protected areas and is the mother of all the threats against the industry.
Died ACTA
Circumvented by the government a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances, the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its initials in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has passed the file.
As you know, the action came despite the Senate had disqualified the possibility as statements of freedom of expression in social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
After years of basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of local basketball history as broad as the is Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And is that before a stroke so confining a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of 28th, player of the National, proxy and leader in the BSN with Gorchakov of Bayamón or Basketball Federation president.
"I got many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Puerto Rico, where he resides with Elizabeth, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes no exaggeration to make such a claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias, reflecting his long career.
Fines in the heart
Of all, which holds more emotion are those that recall his passage through Gorchakov since the fifties as player until 1982, when it was 15 years serving as coapoderado or proxy of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the more I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships Gorchakov since 1967, either as a proxy, coapoderado or leader.
Many years of satisfaction, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy BSN.
Thereafter assumed "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham), told me: "You have a good player, of 6" 7 "of stature.
You want? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players of Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, which was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.
I remember Mincy said that if he had given a championship in Bayamon, Gausse would help bring a more.
The championship with Gorchakov Gausse enjoyed it, but to the distance, since 1988 was already contained in federal kingpin.
For that time preferred to enjoy their records and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when he wins for the first time to the United States during the 1989 Preolímpico in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World, where we came fourth place and should have been brass were it not for the Canadian arbiter that made us repeat the final hand for the second time, Reyes said.
The group is that 1990 World is the best National Team that thou hast seen?
Is among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a pela the United States team, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze in the world.
The team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young people, to the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been in the 1990s due to a knee injury.
A team that it was perhaps the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the del Preolímpico of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players from role as "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, wins gold against all odds.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín.
And that is without counting his career in different leagues played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had until 17 teams in a season.
What you got to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, as the regionalization of the 28th.
For example, boys in Ponce only playing in your area and only facing teams of other corners of the island in playoffs nationals.
Now children travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of certifications and compulsory course for leaders, officials and arbitrators.
I am pleased about that.
What do now?
The most I do is to listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally going to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, was made famous by its central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J. R.." In the television series "Dallas", embodying a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., house producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role that most liked", said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who performed the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when died in a hospital in Dallas, said the publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
Taking joy to anyone who knew.
I was creative, generous and affectionate fun, funny, talented and much extrañaré.
"It was a person original and lived life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with cirrhosis of the liver and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995 he found a malignant tumour in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous in television as a decent in light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
It understood the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is disrupted when is an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and delivers to live with him to his home.
It was also protagonist of two comedies that were little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Their work in film roles included well received by the criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Fool" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the gracefully loathsome J.R. that brought Hagman to its maximum overdrive.
The drama of the CBS on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was the air April 1978 in May 1991.
The promotional phrase "who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman nearly is killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars in risky bets houses.
It also helped to give the set a record for hearing at that time.
When it was revealed the answer in a chapter in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched him and converted to "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which took 50 million viewers.
Was the wife of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. the only and then threatened to characterise it as a prostitute unless it is outside the city, but others also had reason to attack it.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a smile charismatic: A businessman cheat and a cheating husband that it attempted to his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was interned.
"I know what I want in the tombstone of J. R.." Said Hagman, in 1988.
I should say: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiated that lost.
Chief victory, in the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "huge, inside and outside the screen."
Is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of people in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were lucky.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
I had already completed the recording of five chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, reported the chain.
Immediately there was no pronouncement of Warner and TNT on how to handle the series loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when I was in 1931 during her marriage to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
Luck tested theatre in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While he was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities.
In 2001 titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Such about My Life."
"Did not put nothing there that I thought that would hurt someone or affect them somehow," he told Associated Press at that time.
After liver transplant became promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients fearful.
"The advise, I value, I meet them when they come to their surgeries, and then", indicated in 1996.
I try to offer some consolation, as "may be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they will be well."
It was also campaigner against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Initiated course that explores the "End of the world"
Each week, students explore topics like nuclear war, apocalyptic zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the teacher in religion Stuart excellent Ep decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that had a hook irresistible: An end to the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on 21 December, which stuck many people as proof that is the end of the world.
But excellent Ep had no idea what I expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where theorists Christians of the end of times believe that will start the Apocalypse.
"I realized that this was going to be the half more apocalyptic than has been excellent Ep," said this week to students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, the Associate Professor Barry Vacker is conducting the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore topics like nuclear war, apocalyptic zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas are proliferating in time", he said, and the way in which offer some hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, may ignite a war.
This month students discussed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how it compares with examples of real life.
"I have tried to educate students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have done team to teach a course entitled only "The end of the world".
"We do not add any '2012' for always having the option of providing the course again, in the event that the world is not over," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generating projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students forced to work "to the same night that it is assumed that the world ends," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturates in two hours," said Restall on his course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We receive messages via email for weeks and weeks prior to the semester of people who were asking if there was still a place.
Students, for its part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what they do people to be consoled themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," she said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of 21 December.
"Our first project focused on the Mayan prophecy and in some ways it denigrates," said Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Temple, 21, of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a boom in these speculations.
"Elsewhere people do not think about this," he said.
In mostly in the anglophone world.
Joseph Gregory, a professor of religion at the University La Salle offering courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew on a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon by the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years has been spoken of many days of reckoning, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin to think immediately in the next stage" or to philosophise that on 21 December is the start of a period of seven years after the end of the world.
Students and teachers were being taken lightly date.
Several said they think go to parties "of the end of the world".
"Maybe call some friends to riamos together," said Samira Ford, student of communications for 20 years.
