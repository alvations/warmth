So what happens? CSSD not or Voldemort or baking in Prague.
The new elected CSSD to the capital's mayor will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand the level of council with their old and new collegues DOS.
The daily Actualne.: " tested " the new members of the council belonging to CSSD treaties, whether they are argôt born during the dernieres years to City Hall, when the current coalition partners led to Prague.
The coded language that the cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
I was surprised it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not include trés well known terms.
At least the say.
" Who is Valdemort ."
" I am really not. "
" I am a jeunôt in the political Concept responded Lukas Kaucky, elected to the culture testing of vocabulary of " godfather ."
And as regards the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina responded the same way.
For example the " hole in golf. "
" This is the only expression as I propose that I use "
Otherwise, I am not the argôt.
From vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne 1605 published expressions in June of this year before the congrés pré-éĺectoral DOS, has chosen 6 examples, particularly those associated with the mayoralty of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of " Voldemort ," " the biggest hole of golf to Prague, go to the patisserie ," " nerve of beef ," " betrayal of the capital " and " entôler ."
Three of elected agreed for the quiz show, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, which must lead education to Prague in the future - has promised to begin a maintenance but then did not phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has refused the test.
" I am not at all these things lá and how to enjoy the representatives of democratic citizenship: I will not give my opinion. "
" I am currently dealing with how we understand in the framework of our programmes, we have responded.
as we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky does not recognize apparently in the above legend, that it is of the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the right Roman Bem.
" Voldemort " says nothing á'Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is " the biggest hole of golf to Prague.
" It is tunnel Blanka " said Kaucky and immediately added: " But I know newspapers ."
" I will have to pay a language course ," pleasant t it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, elected to the environment, know that the hole in golf is the tunnel Blanko.
The two Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the man - he believes in the sense of " go to the shop.
" It is, I think, in a company, Plachy is ready to guess that it was the headquarters of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalled that he draws its knowledge rather than newspapers and not a vocabulary that he would use.
According to the tests no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
" I have taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we have not really something of this kind ."
" It is quite the names some time using abbreviations and symbols ," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, the party members call Hulda.
" I called Briza to school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like this, admit Karel Brezina about the surnoms.
The daily Actuel] has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly old Petit, the representative Miroslav Poche, which attracted the attention on him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed " the small joujou ."
The surnoms are also the only allow use of the party Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky is not much hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel] has been another nickname for the President of Prague.
" Doctor batons " recalls appeared Petr Hulinsky won his Juris Doctor JUDr. academy police bratislava.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of witches, has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the women reported witches have common features.
They are part of the older generation, not by example for health reasons, are free and have no children.

The accusations of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had doused.
This is the BBC server that sent this information.
Criminals said it was bad.
According to their version the oil which is used for onctions ritual was emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil has spiralled apparently when the team wanted to " dispel the bad spirit " of the woman.
The isolation of witches is approved by people of all levels of education.
daily newspaper Der Standard cited a contractor 42 years of Burkina Faso: " The eating human minds have always represented a danger ," said he.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia no later than last year has seen the President himself participate.

The tenant of Bakal: The poèles heat, it has signed a high rent.
A man imposing went out the door of the centre of RPG Byty of Baron of coal Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
was under his arm a dossier with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son who is currently serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent to the three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the son must resolve from next year to an apartment 2+1 second class 4100.
" And there is no hot water and heating works in solid fuel, singled out on the new contract of his son who has the power to signature.
" But I signed " explains t it to motié angry and half resigned.
The civic association apartments BytyOKD 1605 who described the nouelles rental arrangements as " immoral and indecent ," advises tenants sign and wait until 7 December, which will be issued a notice to explain how to claim.
But responding to this by a gesture of the hand.
" One said, another said something else " they eyebrows.
The region Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
after the New Year, it expects most of the apartment in the Czech Republic, which rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne] has for that reason decided to visit the facility.
The waiting room of RPG in the street Havirovska is one of four the Ostrava and it is already full Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next door is a custody of a society with a device to draw customers.
A special button, " rent 2011 ," is displayed on the screen tactile.
One pressure and a paper with a lot of the aircraft.
You do not have the time to read your number 157 that your number is already struck on the big screen in the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second it is your turn.
After a short time, an old couple is for rent, but the new rent does not seem to apply to people in the room.
Most people had come to resolve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, events on insurance and others.
In Ostrava, the people of 44000 apartments of portfolio of RPG receive correspondence with the new leases in their post office since about mid-November.
RPG Byty their proposed rent increases of 3 to 38 percent.
Special window for the new rent is open to the public since the 18 November.
" it works for nearly a week, it is still testing ," after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client is as journalist.
The déragulation and former apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The Vice-President of Parliament and come from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of Social Democrats reported fairly sustained before the elections and this is now the local newspapers.
" 20 years after them, I want a new floor ."
" They did not have even changed a put. .. n windsurfing in the wc, is introducing the rights mentioned.
, however, it is, according to the employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent if they sign up now as RPG had promised in a special offer.
This is a cut of half the amount of rent that will be the other loctaires which have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the window deregulation of the street Havirovaska is not weighed down by the issues.
" Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent, " said the employee in the window.
Yet RPG porpose both on its website that the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties could not agree on the rent is an independent tribunal that makes the decision.
' every one is not threats, but only to inform on the single and legitimate way to act lawfully ," said RPG on its website.
" Here nobody will go to court believe one of the RPG used Byty and the man in the street in the centre of customers agree.
" I have 13000 wreaths and I have 5,000 to eat, I do not have enough to go to court, said.
The employee was suddenly ill at ease.
" We will see ."
" Mr. Zaoralek media request that nobody sign and therefore the people expect, " said t it.
rent regulation ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
," the current rents are still not the level necessary for the maintenance of funds for housing, " said Pavel Klimes, director of residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of funds for housing that makes the tenant angry is the primary reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG has been with the rent invest in apartments 4 billion in four years 2011 has 2014 should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung from the ceiling in the face of cushioned seats in the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, repeat, however, some information incorporated in red.
'L'augmentation rent in 2011 is 15% and no fewer than 31200 apartments over 90 percent of the apartments RPG ."
" And this will always be the most 7.50 CZK the square metres per month ," said the screen.
The increase of 38% does that 400 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
" In such cases, it is an increase of a very low 19.66 CZK to square metres ," adds RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase of 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money rent increases (cf. the connected graph) to apartments in the form of economies of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign up to the agreement on the higher rent have priority.
The nursery school, too, have understood the architects.

No one could have expected that it is also a mini nursery school with everything - walls of colours, imaginative furniture, toys and a playground miniature on the terrace.
Since October last year, can make the children of employees of Arch. design.
society projets-architectonique Arch. Design. workshops have produced a number of buildings in Brno thought its mini nursery school of business since the start of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, especially to children and it was important that women architects and managers can quickly return to work.
With contract of employment decreased time, the school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by Arch. Design in the framework of the social agenda.
Manufacturers and architects have the opportunity to combine a work with the care for the children.
These are employees of Arch. Design. themselves have imagined this nursery school and with the support of the leadership they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

The parents use their time working the most productive way.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of trust between the employee and the employer.
Arch. Design was included among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and this reinforces the marketing of RH.
The house in bones is mesmerizing, even after 100 years. Take a look in the inner to sit.
The toît looks like the back of a saurien prehistoric, the staircase to a backbone of dinosaur and the balconies to gueules of fish.
to the Casa house Battlo to Barcelona architect Antoni sit.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname House.
organic forms, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, façade recalling scales and present curves, this is everything ypique for the New Art of Antoni sit.
The frontal facade of the house place its dream, its pleasant colours and textures that recall the nature and animals.
During a more detailed comment on the geometry, the pace and the thought with precision.
In the night the front of the house becomes even more dramatic and showed that the impression of brightness colours is strengthened.
The winding and the torsion occurs of forms is also reflected in the inner with the same measure.
Wood copy in waves the windows, the balustrades, decorative elements of doors, the oeilleton and gills.
house Battlo which looms in the Eixample street market Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born of a house of 1877 the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was made for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich businessman, was first highlighted the demolition of the vieile construction and building another any new but accepted early idea to sit an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But idea of Casa Battlo as the house to multiple homes was not thought by sit alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its proposed that the decorations are born to an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque window-dressing.
For the facade had also worked for other artists and creators.
The Group for the house Casa Battlo began with cooperation succés between Jujol and sit down.
Jujol participated in the construction of the homes sit Casa Mila and park Guell in which there are other works to sit.
The premises have dubbed the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms House in bones ."
Others, given the specific mechanism opening windows called " the house that decaying ."
It is said that the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain religious hidden.
sit thought to house a single in his time of central heating system, with air vents and typical chimneys.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the establishment sit did not comply with the guidelines of construction then and has not left hamstrung by them.
At the beginning of the construction had been part of the city the permits, as we know, of course that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after for finishing the council was horrified and asked for changes.
It is all wrong, for example, to members of the city council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the public pavement.
There was never change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo demanded (and got satisfaction) permitted to rent the top two floors.
The owner déménagea to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common and the third chamber and a closed part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery.
The whole house six floors is shared by a staircase in which access to a terrace of toît independent.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by walls curves.
sit travailla also the modern concept of liaison.
The party may be completely connected by opening the doors and the high society was comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction to sit has received new fronts a toîture non-traditional and two floors.
The game to sit with the light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which is decorated the courtyard and with light wells.
The game two colours give a maximum light in all stages of the house.
enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than the dark who absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa house Battlo registered in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund UNESCO perhaps visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the more spacious apartment and the most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners were determined to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150ème anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They have continued visits because they have seen that this is a lucrative business and have broadened the scope of visits to the common spaces and the attic including terraces of toît.
The ticket in the monument is not really expensive, costing € 36.01; students, pensioners, and holders of tourist maps have 20 per cent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings sit in the city.
If you want to feel the atmosphere of the house, with its fantastic bunkers, you quickly find a friend among the residents of the house and completely visit the house.
How can choose a mattress and a sommier: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious framework, but the quality of the surface just bedrooms, and therefore the mattress and the sommier provide a basis for a good read.
They must naturally complement smoothly to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are crucial: weight, size, age, health and the sex of the owner.
The type of procedure which will put the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the cottage where we never sleeps continually latex mattresses are inadequate because they " warm " slowly.
They have, moreover, on mattresses in polyurethane standards.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If there is also enough channels of distribution in the heart and if they remain, on a solid, they retain moisture. In the fungus can also form.
The habit is also crucial in the choice.
Anyone who is the clear time abroad that often very thick mattress with a layer rammollissante, will feel hard on a low and hard surface.
" All the hokeyistes returning NHL complain that they cannot sleep.
" For their tired shoulders, legs and the coast, they need mattresses with a layer rammollisante foam lazy ."
" Such mattresses are recommended for people who suffer from diabetes have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore acted " information " and the ," said Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in furniture suites.
That is why a few years the mattresses with foam lazy won the hokeyistes and other clients.
" Today all went well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Growers example mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL for a lazy foam.
The " miracle " simply.
It maximizes the rigidity and his form in the heat absorbed or adapt to the heat of your body.
There is pressure on you and you go back not in the night and after a difficult match.
You sleep just better.
foam lazy also works as a protection against the esquarres.
The choice of mattresses, depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman from a size 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed in two places should be 90 cm in all 180 cm.
For beds in one place, the singles, for example, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
It is easy to visit.
'Cependant it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on their backs you should ask the hands so comfortable with the shoulder slightly accepted Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators devoted to the issue of a healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture and taught in the schools.
For a bed in two places everyone needs its own sommier and mattresses, therefore, however, during the achât of selecting the height of mattresses.
Otherwise you would not remain in the sommier at different heights and this is not feasible in all settings.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattresses to jurisdictions at least 15 cm, this count for the layer of form and ventilation at least three centimetres.
" In or while seated on the mattress you should not feel ," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattresses request a quite determined sommier.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and the sommier united as sisters Siamese, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
mattresses are aèrent very wrong; it should not wash, which is commonly auhourd'hui.
And because during the night exudes normally 0.2 to 0.75 litre of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattresses begins to recall a great (and blocked) sieve.
For the experts dismiss the claims on a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life.
But to her but.
And for a board of experience of sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, do not, on the surface of mattresses, sanitation or washing but add a protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and washing.
And although today it is often produce surfaces with closure to slide for the whole, it is to say that, after the opening was two parties (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) if not manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when cut off a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
You are in your bed a rigid instead of a sommier?
Never!
Up to a bed for visitors for one night only.
However équipez do (if there has not) ventilation holes and use the mattresses to jurisdictions with a minimum of 15cm with springs in packets (Germany Taschenfederken) and a ventilation.
A mattresses in polyurethane should not be part of such a bed.
For sommiers gills to position with 14/18 gills, the mattresses latex or so-called sandwichs (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut -RRB - are the ideal but it would be much better for you to have a mattress with gills, 28 and above, where the gills are doubled in the part of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattresses at several positions should not take mattresses to jurisdictions because it does not change of position.
A side setting the rigidity of gills either also so-called a cradle.
It is a special link the gills to pressure or even acknowledge the lamelle on the shoulder of dormeur " is " well.
For men who have " shoulders as wide as the back " is really something important.
This is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses that " male " began using a zone rammollissante of shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer a more soft surface in the hips.
For the more difficult customer there are sommiers wings or booklets with so-called a suspension multiforce.
The pressure destroyed in more and diinue tension.
Of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (and inflated) on good mattresses and sommier, the " more " should be replaced.
The basic rule is a pillow simple: the pillow must support the head and its peaks must meet only the shoulders, to muscles shoulders can relax.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When one is lying on the side, the pillow needs to level (with the cradle of shoulder sommier or the area rammollie in the mattresses) the height of shoulders.
mattresses modern still have something in common with the first of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers are still using natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also on organic mattresses.
raw materials to pétrôle, from which it produces the polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use the soya.
" The Bio qualifier for the mattresses means that the heart is manufactured using natural products, " said Petr vasicek of Growers Plus.
natural materials are also used in the linings of mattresses; the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that perfumes the forest or lavande.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracted from plants of birch to that of mattresses absorbs heat and cool down, " hardening ," coating ' heat " women.
A red pepper the bloodstream and is therefore more hot for the weaker sex.
The current favourites?
The mattress made from foam cold (it has more pores with a cellular disrupted therefore more respirante that the standard polyurethane and has more strength.
rigidities of foam combination cold now mattresses polyzones who know exactly where the head, the lower back and foot.
You will pay a mattress of quality from 7,000 kroner and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters are less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the top.
Economiser on mattresses and the sommier is not easy.
It may from time to time in special actions on the part of manufacturers and producers two mattresses for the price of one.
As such the society Magniflex which proposes mattresses Duofreeze with memory foam Memory feeble in lining 11990.
can of course take the second free.
The era of foam lazy or viscoélastiques with a cellular open and a great wall has been launched with the Tempur to a cosmic pace.
It started as for NASA parceque astronauts were to start load factors.
The Tempur is rammollit heat and is hardening, on the contrary, in the cold.
It is therefore perfectly to the human body hot and distributed under pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
mosses viscoélastiques are used not only for the mattress, but also for the health products, such as the special cushion for the feet to alleviate the legs and the system veineux.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or similar.
The aircraft to monitor people are increasingly sought by the parents to monitor their children.
The fear for their child brings more people to think about the monitor through a GPS.
system, introduced at the beginning to find cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such exmple that of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently too great a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the small Anicka moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
. " We are trying to tell everyone that it is not spying but only an alternative to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy, " said Petr Pilin society MAcro Weil is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the market.
" I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases ."
" The majority of people are clients who really buy the product for security reasons, said Pilin.
According to the children should always knowing what is used " box " and how the emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, drew attention if the child does not want to be on something of this type, débarassera.
'Et even the smallest can demonstrate a great creativity when it comes to rid express something when they do not want to be in control.
" The phones, which can be cut as they trace, have already led parents to long delays, " says Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of system can assist in case of aggression is very questionable.
" If it is a kidnapping prepared, the author will ensure that the child has no electronic device which could locate ."
" Today, it is the phone ."
" Once will develop devices, they (criminals) will seek them because the sale will be supported by advertising campaign ."
" In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police, " said psychologist.
She admits that such aircraft can help during an attack not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers trace both cars and people, claims to have this type of device can help, even if it was destroyed in the case of an attack.
" The aircraft can be paramétré so it emission régulière after a period of time ."
" In the case where the aircraft is destroyed, it remains the final position of the person concerned ."
' more expensive aircraft were also a inclinomètre immediately reported the position of the person who had slipped and in the position extended nothing ', said Cech.
According to the phones so-called intelligent are equipped with a navigation system can propose a similar service after formatting with a prologiciel Special.
tracking systems problem today is that it is either a system similar to those in pendentif the size of a box of matches or the smaller telephones.
It may still lose.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, which is why the tests are being conducted to make aircraft which resemble common digital watches.
" will be the advantage that the potential aggressor cannot recognize tracing system ."
" Or he realizes after some time, given the police more time ," he adds.
What tracing system is developed in the form of bracelet or pendentif, it utilisiera always the same technology to trace of cars.
It is a combination of acquisition systems to a position of GPS (which is currently used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone to alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army of cordeaux detonating it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with. But it can take two years.
The Army has purchased for 445 km of cordeaux used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of cordeaux is two to four years.
The army bought cordeaux detonating the company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the achât a huge amount of cordeaux detonating at MF DNES that soldiers used 60 km per year.
According to reserve calculations to detain made by the pyrotechniciens army, that MF DNES contacted, it shows that even the generals, the officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual exercise explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of cordeaux detonating.
A distance is 25 000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army could meet for 10 years.
If instead would be the basis of new training professionals it to 2 m cordeaux explosive, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase assured - and the use of special units and engineering - reservations for 225 years mentioned.
Yet soldiers in the brigade of rapid intervention have recently complained to Minister Vondra they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that firing meetings are limited because of money.
On the lack of underwear is not.
" I am taking a lead they buy in a large quantity of cordeaux detonating ."
" And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing ."
" for the army is a good client that we strive as traders to please ," said the business manager of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, arguing the achât of hundreds of kilometres of cordeaux detonating by the fact that the army will take these ammunition in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reported, however, only four years of life cordeaux explosive and the pyrotechniciens of the police and army for only two years.
" if they are perfectly stored in deposits, it may go even four years ," said two who did not want his name published with regard to the criticism of the army.
The time of life past, each must be tested to see if it remains and posed no threat to the life of the soldier.
These tests are not free and cost more money.
The other argument is due to the quantity discounts for 445 km of cordeux detonating.
" They have cost 60 per cent less than the year of 245 km, said the spokesman Pejsek to be put to the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of cordeaux detonating the pyrotechniciens police control for the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed the 1500 metres.
And the police control not only the quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for security reasons of pyrotechniciens and to obtain more flexible types of cordeaux detonating more modern and more reliable.
the Ministry of Defence has major problems for the disposal of tens of tons of munitions from the time of Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak strong army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move on the Rhine.
The waiting in a few years the Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old cordeaux detonating it now buys " cheap ."
So today I take advantage of contacts that I have achieved thanks to the assistance.
The sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for winner of the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, contractor for 28 years.
His adventure to the succés is like a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved travel.

In his savings on what he had won when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan it has bought a small building five apartments half demolished.

" With those that I met with the help I began trading regularly.
According to him, the renowned linked to succés has had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
" I observed among them especially the loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been generally recognized ."
" by far the only result of my work, but the result of a good job for us all.
" Only my name is driven forward, " said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With the sense of winning Farmet has the worst behind.
Anyone who is for the price Slovansky dum for first place in the competition for the Firme year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury awarded the efforts with which he transformed a workshop tools to Ceska Skalice in a company sales of 100 million kroner.
'Je can say that the prize has encouraged not only me my also my staff and increased our confidence in itself to combat competition ," said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky renting a small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, it has not hesitated for a long time, has refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and created a society with a few peers in the entourage of his father for baths in plastic.
Not long after they have begun to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
It has become after 18 years the largest automatic presses in Central Europe.
Society has been known in the public audience after the succés obtained the support through the media.
" Not only our customers have started to really better known brand Farmet but also the foreign partners that have begun to realize that they were working with a company which won the most succés in his country of origin, " said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has e has not risen to Farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the society had been made from the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery of engineering.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected the citizens, the companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new equipment and technology.
" We have not escaped to this situation ."
" The turnover dropped 40% , and we dûmes limit our production and even fire ," said Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation properly and have retained results bénéficiares even if they were less than what they had before the crisis.
However in Farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
" We have built with holdings a training and research centre, have strengthened the presentation of the society in salons-expositions international and won the main awards shows, said Zdarsky.
While we believe that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires date back and with the number of employees also.
" In the new winner I wish this nice sense of victory but in a calm atmosphere ," said Karel Zdarsky.
The survey which deletes senseless regulations.
The survey on the Nonsense of the year for the fourth time a party elders cases.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The ugly winner this year on the Nonsense of the year was the requirement in the offices of documents that staff can seek on-line.
More than a third of 4,000 voters have voted for it.
. For example, the government of Social Affairs asked for a copy of the company while are the two mouse clicks.
change thanks to the investigation.
" The administration Czech insurance will require more extract of the commercial register for the controls of the insurance payments, said Jana Buranova, spokesman of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To reflect all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must meet in the Czech Republic and remove those absurd is the meaning of this the Nonsense of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a party elders Affairs held by Hospodarske noviny and has greater popularity.
If the year 3000 voters are shown, it is at least 4,000 this year have made their voices heard.
And Not surprisingly, there are in our countries the various legal obligations that hamper the company, and more and more.
" We are perhaps the number of documents to the tax declarations to the first places in the world, " said Karel Havlicek Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is a declared aim of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world situation in the Czech Republic does not improve.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is 74 4th place as regards the conditions for the company, or 8 places over the last year.
The examination of the Nonsense of the year has been established for the first time in 2006, and continues each year on the same scenario.
Anyone can report each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
reported it gets the website. firmaroku. . Then, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for " antiprix " and leaves the public vote for the month of October on the website. firmaroku/absurdita and. ihned. .
The Nonsense received the largest number of votes is declared winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is a 100, or more precisely 105 regulations and décrêts who lost their sense of existence.
remarks are sent by the contractors but also the trade unions and teachers.
Among the finalists, among the nominees is by example the obligation that the highway maintenance vehicles and rapid pay tolls, or that the contractors with 20 employees, repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins in early November on the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening which regularly figures from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized businesses in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'La economic prosperity cannot function when the state took âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and my goal is to remove each year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company, " said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to delete décrêts absurd is not a sword in water.
In 2007, which do not all wrong people was the obligation of entrepreneurs say three days before the room for individual firms to the whereabouts of the company, plans to move to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This obligation was removed with the ammendement of the individual.
The second most popular in 2007, which was to declare to the Office of the work a trip to a foreign employee on 30 days, was eliminated with the Act on so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session.
The Nonsense 2009 has been the décrêt for physiotherapists have a large mirror in their offices, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
That has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health the year dernière-l'obligation for a refrigerator has been deleted.

In the first year of this subset of the firm support of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, are on companies that do not have succés with one long-term objective for the company.

In Fund Land to Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Fund Land to Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
detectives have handcuffed to the local entrepreneur and businessman property Lubos.
The plate had tried to manipulate a tender for the settlement of a claim in such a way that the proposed ground is obtained by a candidate.
The plate to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
" At the moment I can only confirm that the police are still a person for insider dealing in the framework of a bid and a concour. stated for the journal Pravo the director of the Department of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
Police have released after 24 hours this contractor for 46 years.
For how it might affect a public competition, we can only speculate given the little official information.
A question of Pravo, the spokesman of the Land Lubomira Cerna reported that the police had really made an arrest in Plzen on a separate work and, during the public assistance.
" It has been a client and in any case of an employee, she noted.
The public Cerna as true " Appeal to propose to the transfer of land in the land " and is set up when occur several candidates beneficiaries of law.
" They offer, in the framework of the call, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be resolved before announced the value on the ground ."
" According to the proposed rights a classification of buyers is established and the Land then transfers the field to the person who has proposed the most senior, " said the spokesman.
Lubos G had, it is clear information on people who enrolled, and as it is, too, a person bénéficiare having bought a large number of refunds, it was proposed for ground not to participate in the competition.
And it encaissait likely to withdraw.
The explaining why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G had contacts far standards at FdT (Land Fund).
appeared in the case of the former chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing of land which had been edited the decision to set up a construction.
Just Lubos G had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place where the artery access to the industrial zone Borske Pole.
Later he échangea with the town hall to a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because it might put the construction in danger by a block of land.
The households will pay a supplement of 100 kroner monthly for housing.
The households will from January pay extra for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation supplies of heating and in some places rents will grow.
Families will from January from their wallets to a 100 kroner monthly more than now.
The grow by 4.6% , the gas of almost 2% more, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth of the provision of water and in many places the central heating supplies will be more expensive.
The increase in electricity expected to households in apartment the 100 kroner anuellement more than currently.
However all suppliers have reduced the price of electricity since the sensitive to encourage the production of renewable energy development, including batteries photovoltaÏques.
Gas increased moderately but of course when people most need to heat and have the biggest consumption.
can count also 100 kroner.
While electricity and gas increase in the Czech republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
mainly the most common plan.
For example, Pardubice or Hradec households Kraloce pay from January to the central heating almost 50 more kroner per month, the families of Libérec pay more than 1,000 kroner annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in the event that the city is increasing rents for infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a supplement of 6.8 per cent.
The price to Prague will again amongst the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest water and sanitation increase of 7.4 per cent.
The rent will increase by example significantly in the 450 000 rental apartments from January to the end of regulation.
For example the ICC society Byty Usti nad Labem has almost 2,500 apartments, has decided to increase to 100 per cent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increases would be brought before the courts by the society.
The rent regulated that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase 10% next year.
The Czech children is saoûlent on rum and fernet. The beer is mode and is slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptional also the best brand of whisky are stolen.
It is drinks that cause most often those saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
The children who were treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the experience of doctors who face similar cases to the admissions department children hospitals.
" The beers and wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be saoûl ."
'La trend is really spirits ," said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chief department of the hospital Horovice in Bohemia.
" When they manage to chiper a cylinder father in the cupboard, this is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka that prévalent'.
" The vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so not the ," said the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the hospital Motol, it also gives reason.
" In general, rum or fernet ."
" This is alcohol to the way schools ."
" In some cases, it was slivovice returned home ," added Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, see drunk children aged 13 to 14 years for hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before work to Horovice since last year, it was Motol where he worked 10 years in paediatrics ambulances were schoolchildren large around drunk.
" A girl was admitted to hospital, and four times
" It acommencé his career to twelve years when it decided with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol dansle blood with a mixture with the extasy ," described the doctor this case particularly important.
" It was Parc des Exhibitions of Holesovice to a party ."
" What is interesting is that it was not funny to the mother that her daughter was not included in 48 hours " said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the selflessness of parents or their tolerance outside the common face up to the fact that their reject the drink which are the root cause of the développment of alcohol abuse of children.
According to experts, not dependence, in the strict sense, for the children.
" Under the alcohol is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the attendant phenomena, but that is not among children.
" Among those who use the acool repeated, rather, it is a back-ground social significantly adverse ," was the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokesperson Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic at Motol.
are integrated into the stastistiques cases with a grâve poisoning requiring hospitalization.
The drunk children who are after emergency care sent home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
In addition to children who sit and drink a bottle of spirits after school, he exsite in Pélikan three seasonal waves with count: the day of witches, the Good Sylvester and the end of the school year.
" Either they drink despite after poor results in fact they are celebrating the beginning of summer.
" Of course I have lived to the day of witches an admission of 7 children drunk at a stroke, pointed Pélikan.
The child drunk who spent the night in hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than that went home and the aftermath of the " hangover ."
The headaches morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients whose body needs.
" They are better off because they spend a good evening and a mild awakening and nothing is evil ."
" They are just surprised the location ," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time that striker the good humour of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care bed up to tens of thousands.
" From time to time, I have applied as a means of education in cash to these children how their drinking claimed and that they could spend the summer in seasonal work to repay a single evening ," added Pélikan.
however, the insurance companies in their management in decline, which should recover from parents charges care, not children drunk.
Two aircraft L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159 five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain which the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS.
It is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad in exercises or demonstration flights.
It is versions of biplaces of L-159T1 which were until now in service in the Czech army and was flying.
Lestrois remaining aircraft are versions of monoplaces of L-159.
Those plate are stationed at the moment in Aéro Vodochody and through trading - the firm Omnipol - has taken into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure planes Vodochody is currently unknown.
' aircraft L-159 monoplaces planned to have been taken on aircraft stored for a long time without cause or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence.
" The biplaces L-159 T1 have been exchanged in the state, " said Pravo Pejsek.
It added that the army will not biplace since the ministry has signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody agreement worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four monoplaces L-159 unused in two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first plane in July, the second scheduled delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft in the capital of certain countries of the Alliance.
" In the contract it is clear that provides the aircraft L-159 account is EADS and that they will be used in the training of pilots of member countries of NATO ."
" This is therefore the case that which takes into account how to do this, " indicated Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army was not concerned by the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched tendering and contacted directly EADS.
the direction of the defence were arguments when the exchange is a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased at Aéro Vodochody 72 aircraft used in that 24, sell the rest.
The jets Casa is likely to have legal implications.
the European Commission had filed a complaint against the Czech defence ministry to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in the framework of a tender at European level and in any case directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa, the latter should arrive on the Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
An index than the ring is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index than the ring are exposed to a lower risk of cancer of the prostate.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British journal Cancer.
That may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
" Our findings show that the length of the finger serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly for men before 60 years ," declared the study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on the cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should take the test of prostate cancer, including combined with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants as the antécedents family health, added Eeles.
During the period of 1994-2009 it followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand shorter than the ring.
For them, as for 19 per cent of those who had the fingers of the same length, it was found the same likelihood of cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those who had the longest that ring the risk is, however, dropped to 33 percent for men before 60 years in the risk rose to 87 per cent.
The report length of two fingers - trained during the prenatal period - states of different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
A less testosterone is a index.
previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that development aid cancer of the prostate.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, généticien Czech renowned and former president of the National Academy of Sciences, said to KTC that he is aware of this study but does not, apparently, that the relationship between the length and the cancer is " completely demonstrated ."

For example, it is computers and servers to companies and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the region of Rhin-Main is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu account certainly much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, Bad Homburg to settle at Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries operating in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square metres have hired in the building Astro Park.
The old complex, whose name recalls his plan in the form of star, is between the headquarters of the Confederation of Industry and Electrotechnical.
Expulsion server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks it more difficult.
The ISP Amazon has expelled from its servers the auction site in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be political pressure suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently in England.
In the United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with more force.
The group cyber-activistes " Wikileaks has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now seeking a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent US Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, stays in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
" Wikileaks excluded from the server Amazon. "
" Freedom of expression in freedom, reported Wednesday (local time) cyber-activistes of revelations on the social network Twitter.
Shortly before that, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had deleted the documents of Wikileaks of its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes have resorted to Amazon Web (AWS) in order to reach the highest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: " Wonderful, our dollars are now spent on people in Europe. "
When freedom of expression is a problem to Amazon, " they should stop selling books ."
The television channel CNN, citing the office of Mr Liebermann, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks use its servers after the investigation by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott, told the British newspaper, The Guardian ."
" I would have liked that Amazon take this position earlier in relation to previous publications by Wikileaks classified information " claimed the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to deny the use of servers in the platform.
" Wikileaks is illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangering lives throughout the world, " according to a statement of independent senators.
" No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of documents stolen. "
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of wanted by Interpol.
According to information disseminated by the London newspaper " The Independent, the Australian 39 years lived in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activiste has consistently described intrigues orchestrated by its critics prosecutions against Sweden.
The spokesman Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats had been made against the site.
" There have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange. "
That is why Assange was particularly concerned for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson reacted clear statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks was tried and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Head of Government adviser Mr. stephen Harper said on television, in ironic, that Mr. Assange should be killed " and that Mr. Obama could use a Drone ."
Meanwhile, a controversy began between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, has described as " ridiculous and absurd " that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if the plate was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and released recently, engage in espionage.
" I do not know exactly why we must take the view of an individual owner of a Web site, " said Mr Gibbs.
" Our foreign policy and the interests of the country are much more important than the assertions of a website. "
The US government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a press release from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre of counter-terrorism, has been appointed for combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place the necessary structural reforms which after disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House has also will verify the means by which the administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US government announced that he wanted to address the safety of dissidents and activists if ever rent-free were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
" We have done everything possible to come into contact with them ," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
" We are ready to protect them if necessary. "
The University of the outer lens
At the university Gelato " of Bologna, preparing the confectioners of ice at best seasons of the year.
The induction of three days for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where the ice?
From Glacier and the ice machine.
The Glacier, i.e. in German producer of ice somewhat old-fashioned, manufactures the cream in all the rules of the Italian art in the ice.
The turbine ice takes the showcase ice cream chilled with a spatule, the states in the gaufre and then began to sell.
To find out, we did not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about the ice, cannot avoid " Gelato-University " of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the university in 2003 so that ice creams from its machines are across the Italian high ideals.
The induction of three days for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
are also offered special on the ice of chocolate and extending over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in the glacerie closed.
In full midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their strong desire on the ice smooth.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia from Hungary.
Jacky, Professor of artistic education come to California is a man of the Slow Food movement. It intends to propose a future European product quality in the outer lens.
Anke Berlin adviser business management and, after a few years, something strange profession, nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the cleaning lady Canadian come because his children love the ice cream Italian.
The owner of Luciano Ferrari primarily due to the ideal of perfect ice characteristics.
East determine not only the good taste, but also the flexibility soyeuse and the right consistency.
However, Luciano has not forgotten during training the icing on the cake of the superstructure and, in general, southern: " The Italian ice is simply the best and it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism. "
The first step in the production is quite simple.
Luciano provides the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixing that fuel to 85 degrees through an electronic programme, and cools immediately to four degrees.
It then held a valve installed on the machine: it is a basic white cream pasteurized, the foundation of all kinds of ice in milk.
The trainer was besieged with question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano cautioned against being mislead by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who does that ice made from natural ingredients, perhaps despite it used stabilisers: a natural product, for example flour bean guar obtained from the beans of guar.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using stabilizing, only must sell within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer does not croquera nothing other than pellets of ice.
Some changes of the estate are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
The Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that one gains in the radius fruit or sweets in the supermarket.
In addition, there is the powder and pasta.
" suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of ingredients flavoured. "
' However, you just try. "
In earnings sorbets fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in the ice cream produced from the mass of basic white, adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and is when you add the cocoa powder, all the possible in chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to produce four kinds of ice: to vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnuts with or without eggs in the estate, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice fruit is also subject to the same experience.
More than fragrances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely best.
The ice to hazelnuts are not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The ice the kiwi fruit, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizing.
" Only a balanced mixture is properly the taste of ice, " says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation: if the use of the chick with much of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the recipe.
An extra sugar is necessary for the lemon ice.
Luciano present a device with which it determines the sugar content of various types of fruit (producers use to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice requires more, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine automatic mass manufacture basic assistance.
There is also a system in which it is simultaneously the mixture of ice available to make it onctueux and reduced to below-zero temperatures.
In spite of all automatisations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barbouille of chick fruit from head to toe and, thus, éclabousse his comrades of studies when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes.
The Luciano believes that a similar incident may occur in every way: it is only a question of time. "
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry which is testing the cultivation of genetically modified crops has hijacked the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the group of experts Testbiotech which is regarded as an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
" It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we informed ," said on Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports that the chairman of the group of experts Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked a determining factor in the development of test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticism made by Mr. Then.
requirements developed are letter by paragraphs, the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and are thus marks of the industry which, basically, would be monitored by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech a conflict of interest.
A high-level official of the Efsa recently joined without condition or transitional period the Swiss food group Syngenta. In doing so, it has changed sides.
There is little time, even the German Central Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union supervisor and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion of the German Federal Agency for the environment that Members of the European Parliament.
However, the Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
A opinion indicates that is all reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of good quality work.
It does not prohibit experts working for the Efsa to establish contact with the industry.
But they should.
Mr. Kuiper admits that it works for the International Institute for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The agency sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr Then resent the fact that genetically modified crops would be accepted without any test food animals, and that it was not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
" We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize on scope " Mr Then.
The current practice is to test only proteins isolated and not the plant GM, which does not get reliable results.
" If there is not, then how can we find? " asked Mr. Then on an accusatory tone.
That is also the view of Mrs Hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic of Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly influenced and discredit the scientific criticism.
Therefore, it barely exists yet researchers are not linked to companies.
The enterprises, critical studies would not be issued.
Ms. Hilbeck asserts that " the industry control security research ."
The record stone
Uli Gsell has brought total 400 per kilogram.
Monday afternoon, she was in the Stuttgart with a tube station in the back.
There was manif.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, excavators moved and had begun demolishing a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart had the same: Several thousands of people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the Central station in Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the arrest of construction.
Brisée in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (limestone coquillier) Crailsheim, a move crass and poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years living in Ostfildern.
It has provided a few fragments.
" These stones are relics. "
" They must not disappear. "
He said with enthusiasm: " a modest rock and cheap, simple and land. "
It affirming that cutting saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what will this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell also.
traces of stones of Stuttgart in a former munitions depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire of stones.
The rights of 44 years old stones trade.
It has bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
" It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge said in his office in a hut, who was once a guard post.
It recounts how he was the subject of insults and threats when in September newspapers have reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But it has negotiated for days with opponents of the project S21.
And he explained that he could anything at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it is, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 subsequently won one rather boxy stone weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between $6.50 and 14 euros.
Some custody as memory in hoping also to make at a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still packed together in the forest, the rest being long since sold.
Owners of gardens, gardeners landscapers, Individuals.
They came across and have won everything that could in the boot and trailers.
The Stuttgart scandal stones have long " Mäuerle " or limitations of toes herbs.
," this is nothing particular said Mr. Rongen.
" eut-été this political component. "
It enters its coach-and-four, made the turn of its vast empire.
It law that it has abandoned. Later, had begun to study biology before turning to the computer and become a carrier.
And the stones.
The store 40000 tons.
It is hoarding is treasures throughout Germany.
IL claims that it is the largest market of ancient stones.
It is réfrène.
sand carved stones with art are posed on the snow.
" past, They were part of Marienbrücke in Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says enthusiastically.
" My favourite stone. "
takes the path that rises through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre red sand, previously part of the station Karlsruhe.
And so on.
" Joli travertin. "
The rather boxy used to belong to the podium Neckarstadion Stuttgart.
Across the snow stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the police district, the granite reddish colour from the cathedral Good Blasien, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what, what sweat.
When Mr. Rongen believe that once the stones were carved by hand and using palans simple and donkey carts drawn by horse, it becomes very respectful.
" It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in. "
It has not become rich, still less wealthy.
But the carrier currently employs 14 people. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass and a gardener bottlenose moved into the forest.
" We are working hard, but it is gratifying, " says the recycleur of waste.
soon, he must go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Action talent to win the senior potential
The counter is a strong demand.
16 students get to buy bread rolls salmon, tomato sauce and blancs-mangers.
the Technical University of Braunschweig and vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen invited students design and mechanical engineering workshop.
In the context of a kind of competing ideas, they should speak profession on the car of the future with the developers of VW, and, with the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to move the body to body in the competition to find best brains and engage, such as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in the halls before they enter the labour market and they are courted by the other.
And since universities did not issue statements on the performance of their students, trying to identify the exceptional talents in practical projects and to retain.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talent.
A young lady of staff shared the pens, sweets and cards bearing the logo of Volkswagen.
She spoke of the timetable internships and jobs students talent; it shows the railways for access to the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: " The students come into contact with industry and experience. "
" As the Volkswagen group, it can be students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play here. "
According to Mr. horse Such cooperation is unusual.
The again, it is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
" past, the emphasis was on the professional project, " says Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more bitter.
In property sectors, companies cannot recruit their staff through a screening on a host of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and especially the rapid highly skilled work force.
It is mainly graduates from the Engineering in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers are remained vacant in October.
And according to forecasts VDI, the vacuum for engineering expands yet.
Roman Dykta runs hunting skills for KPMG, auditing firm, accounting and consulting.
organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the race KPMG-Race, a kind of rallye-papier competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so they travel the United States.
Participants can also visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and the company.
Anyone who must participate decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates will fly to the United States.
Mr. Dykta, the means used to the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
" We want to emerge of the lot with the race. "
" For us, a simple cruise was too little "
For the hunter talent that is Mr. Dykta, seems to be.
" Until now, we have been in contact with all the people who took part last year in a similar action. "
" Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to extend soon their requests to our company. " he says.
Outside the amadouement direct the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are quite classic through job fairs where they are engaged in hunting drain.
" We are trying to achieve graduates participating fairs. "
" For example, in the lounge of solar technologies ," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources for Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company located in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the notes.
Currently, 35 posts are being competitive on the site of the company.
" At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies. "
" This is expensive and time-consuming has?
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Freiburg.
" The indicate that the student has the option of professionals or write his project to study at home. "
expensive advertising campaigns are among experts.
It is for this reason that the company is trying to make its advertising highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy and easy communication.
" Often, a large group cannot do that ," Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
long ago that money is no longer the main role in the search for employment.
The flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other key factors.
According to a study by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute is a picture of honour annual German employers.
To that end, he asked the staff on their level of satisfaction with their work and context while watching the framework conditions for employees.
The chief of staff Ms. Stübe hope that will enhance the image of the society of job seekers.
" I think the candidates rely mainly to external assessments regarding a potential employer, said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher Using Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies wishing to build a good reputation as an employer in a long-term strategy.
It advises clients to show more of authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means above all to take internal measures.
" The best way for an employer to make attractive is through its own staff ," he says.
That is, according to the jargon in the sector, the strategy of domestic image, i.e. the creation of the image of the employer within his own.
" satisfied employees are the best messengers. "
When addressing its employees and that they identify with the company, they are only advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
" It is as if we played in the orchestra, said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama is cracking down on new oil drilling
There will be no new drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, south-east of the United States, in the years to come.
The Government Washington delivered a ban equivalent, and permanently cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the drilling platform " Deepwater Horizon " is at the origin of this strict prohibition. Act must continue at least for the next five years.
Given this accident which claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, has indicated that it is willing to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
supporters of this solution attempt to reduce US dependence on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who is the responsibility of the oil slick devastating in golf is not, so far, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of several billion, is at the centre of allegations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the suspension of drilling declared after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications to new drilling projects.
With more stringent control measures and procedures more severe, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent authority of control, which was discredited after widespread allegations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced the eliminate lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
actors in this sector are now publicly warning that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than has been the case to date.
" The Government's intention is to curb the rapid growth of oil and gas in the current poll result achieved in the sector by the auditing firm BDO, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance is the uncertainty of this sector: " No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation. "
The investment made in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of the growth.
The Ogoni countries is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is functioning brown; it is a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: In a flight, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The men live theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
" Do you will eventually fall down exhausted ," the environmentalist journalists for the calm: " You today still enough mud of oil before the lens of water. "
The Nigerian 37 years has tried to photograph a young slipped into the water boueuse until the chest, as well as the fat trail around: The scene seems almost beautiful in the water to the colour of the rainbow.
I can 't see that the underground aquifers brown crude oil.
On the banks of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom tells that, once it had the whole shrimp by buckets here.
Meanwhile the calm waters have completely dried up.
It five years ago, a huge quantity of oil has bounced a pipeline explosion in the vast swamp.
Fishermen in the small town nearby Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The Ogoniland located at the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the most polluted in the world.
Any the extent of the devastation springs to mind when reading the mangrove swamps cross rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motorized craft heartrending brown water cradingue. Anyone with plunges his hand the rendered the covered with oil.
The roots of small mangrove emerged from the ground as stalks réglisse. The isolated palms are sadly hung their laurels.
sought in vain to the clouds of birds, as can be seen in the wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a bizarre silence is on this paradise of past resembles a gas station by the smell that it.
" What is happening here is war against the environment ," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari a sad: " Our life is characterized by a constant danger to health. "
The comparison of war is made.
The region where the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged for decades: There are more than 60 years, the first European explorers have entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. the plate was executed later. In 1993, the group Shell had to interrupt its production activities in this region because those plate had become very dangerous for its employees.
today, the return to Ogoniland is prohibited in this society: As more of 2 million barrels of oil daily pumped through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines across the vast region of Delta, three times as Switzerland, the oilfields of Ogoniland are, because the situation is too unstable for the oil.
All a few hundred metres stand in the water tréteaux in steel as bizarre sculptures: " business-like " Christmas trees " the heads of drilling holes.
They had up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion until benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling of this nature snaps from time to time in the piece, because a steady stream of crude oil flows through the water.
estimated experts, more than two billion gallons spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the quantity of oil equivalent to that period in the sea at the accident super-pétrolier " Exxon Valdez 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should be the responsibility of the persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question has divided the player.
For the group Shell, sabotage and the siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 per cent of the pollution. The environmentalists, for their part, see the explosions of drilling and oil punctured as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner criticized the group Shell in Nigeria mainly less stringent safety standards than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of defaults pipeline is " still far higher than alleures ."
Some forms emerging mangroves in a place that, given by far, resembles a workshop abandoned, full of work and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered work up to his neck.
A fire scintille under one of the many barrels which sometimes linked to pipes, sometimes scattered grounds on the site must be répérés: a small refinery illegal.
It is heating the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, said Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a receptacle through pipes, then, at the end of kerosene drops fall and are finally diesel.
Thus, Michael and his four colleagues daily four Diesel drums of 300 litres: " This reported 34 million Naira ," about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest producer of oil in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
refiners illegal can sell at a cheaper price than ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per litre of diesel: Because they are free.
the plate is offered by the patrons who put the network of pipelines in citoyen throughout the countries of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the raw temporarily stored illegally purified: The organized crime networks which are also among politicians and military, give the lion's share of the tankers and the dumping on the world market.
The militant Akpobari believes that the debate on the issue of whether the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax production is purely academic.
" If oil companies were not seen as intrusive and if the foundations of the lives of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries. "
, however, meantime, relations of the Ogoni especially to Shell were so deteriorated that it was only the withdrawal of the group. " perhaps the operators of other nationalities, as the Chinese, will prove better. "
So Michael is nervous.
" It is high time that you déguerpissiez " announced the robust oil worker.
" The soldiers can occur at any time. "
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not arrested, but at best they will offer bribes.
Even soldiers especially from the northern countries intend to use as all Nigerians raw.
" At any point of view, this rotten thing has reduced our country ," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discovered the construction defects in the reactors of the A380
The A380 is clearly a major security problem.
In considering an aircraft made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible defect that can lead to " catastrophic failure of the reactor. "
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
in early November, the passengers on the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had apparently been more fortunate: During the investigation, the Australian authority responsible for air safety noted that some A380 aircraft reactors were a serious security problem, and it warned of a possible lack of construction.
The potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of oil, been in a position published on Thursday by the ATSB.
It could lead to a " catastrophic failure of reactors.
This reactor manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus company Quantas, who had to land the 4 November in Singapore, is one of those.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint in a federal court Australian based in Sydney. This approach provides opportunities to take legal action against the company.
Quantas director, Alan Joyce, said that his company long damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Parts were parts and boost support has been damaged in a fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce is the ignition of oil which is responsible for the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that tests on security will be done on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors.
Council recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The problem is considered important enough to inform all the parties concerned.
After the emergency landing aircraft, the airline Quantas detaining to ground its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of its 11 A380.
The airline Lufthansa has replaced as a precautionary measure, the reactor of a A380.
The plane two floors is the largest airliner in the world.
The snow throughout causes chaos in the transport
Germany as a frame of white: In one night, the snow has fallen on almost all the countries.

Go to hell, warrior!
The film Splatter is an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of former sort through its film, " Valhalla Rising, " epic obstacle.
In which the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn was thought turning " Valhalla Rising "?
a Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) is having an eye is taken prisoner; it is free of his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, removes his opponents one after the other. It seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our heroes uses methods of brutal murder. When bad mood, it ripped from the intestines of its enemies without waiting for rent-free died.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed said no word on its real name. Even the other characters leak, at most, in one or two sentences some horrible screams of agony.
Otherwise, it says nothing and feasting on the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the universe Vikings, about a thousand years.
That would be the ideal more mature film-makers with an interest in the existentialisme and for the travellings excellent.
When a film is several target groups, it is a pity that rent-free are mutually exclusive.
The Winding director Refn is seen since " Pusher ," his trilogy on the drug smuggler fierce and full of style as a sort of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refuses to make a little more mood in the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality cinema cinemas.
Most supporters of art cinema must face the horror in the brain that is spreading throughout and intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed embarks, for reasons that can freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries in a ship of Jerusalem; they are calm and haze drowned during an eternity before the crew is in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising that " Valhalla Rising " has found no distributor of movies in Germany and he is in the DVD format.
It is mainly due to the beautiful images of poverty has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogue in the film, nor of a coherent, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn him barely a moment and it cut the throat with freezing images and a soundtrack grim, but especially with an elusive hatred which comes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, faithfully alongside the one-eyed, maintains a certain innocence, all the others are motivated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose mobile are never known, but who the hell at any time to combat enemies and provisionally allies as warrior, may be sent the devil himself.
It is the deterioration, but perhaps also, for those who are, in any case, rotten.
" Valhalla Rising " is an enigmatic film that can hating or admire, which is irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mystérieux earthwork
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides new insights on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone to submit to the oversight of the agency.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four fighter jets F-15 Israeli I have attacked a mysterious cubic form building on Syrian territory.
It is situated on the banks of the euphrate; the largest city near 30 kilometres is Dair as-Sur.
His name is contained in documents to the IAEA because it is a question of reactor that Syria had built appears with the aid of North Korea in rather boxy stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of power.
According to a briefing of United States intelligence, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the reactor, known as the neighbouring town, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would produce atomic weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation of satellite imagery blurred.
Through the desktop, it was the unlikely location of each reactor before the destruction of the Central is a miniature copy the model nord-Coréen of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, it presented the pictures showing the building located close to, if not within.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of service, but it is not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, it has barely more information at the time, and with time the mystery is épaissit.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor el-Kibar, but had peu'indices showing was " an active programme of nuclear weapons ."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more careful on this subject and speak only of a " alleged reactor, even if they see the presentation of the CIA as " plausible ."
They lack of evidence, and to the IAEA.
Asked how it ensures that it has to be a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations gave a terse response in summer by saying that the IAEA had " sufficient documents to ask questions ."
The Syrian have abducted with haste the rubble of unused military building and Columbia methodical.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, was discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received thanks to a Member State of commercial providers satellite images showing the moment that followed directly attack. it seems that they are more eloquent than those put forward by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired exclusive.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity of objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it had never made a secret nuclear programme and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus contends that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of particles in an incredible.
Since this time -là, damas refuses any discussion on this issue, as on the satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister current at the time of the attack, recently said: " We will never comments on this subject.
The investigation in this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and that it " is increasingly a serious problem of credibility of the Agency, as the recognizes a Western diplomat senior service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately, it is a serious violation of nuclear weapons.
IAEA finds that in order to make progress, we must clarify the existence of three other facilities to be " functional " with the alleged reactor.
Up to now, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities, or what their role or the suspect.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are known within the IAEA respectively in the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of the neighbouring cities.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) of Washington, has identified these communities and discovered on a complex satellite images nearly Masyaf which would most likely be one of the objects suspects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly at the plate; it is exactly why Syria refuses access three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, stating that the Syrians fear that the inspection unit is in fact spies sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
Frankly, it is an information provided by the American secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that the vehicles were made by the shuttle between the three sites and the rather boxy stone to transport drugs.
A Western diplomat senior said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be used in the production of the fuel.
It would have " no guidance on sensitive activities ," as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, which are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly working with the enriched uranium.
, however, it is the rigour of reasonable assumptions concerning the following fundamental questions: where would have had and where should we separate later plutonium for bombs.
The it was not clear whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land will disappear, nobody will have information on the storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has review in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located only a few miles of el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In analysing recently satellite pictures for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between those plate and the reactor.
photos taken by satellite, however, show that Syria has begun work terrace in the three suspects and moved to huge containers where the IAEA started to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but that has not helped to avoid suspicion.
In expressed in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections do. This plan should allow Syria to maintain any secrets. Only time invested shows how much interest the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
a year ago, though Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not reported in this case, states, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador of recent months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful of the International Atomic Energy Agency to implement its controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of an option to which I am open in the future ," but it is still reluctant.
This is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority to the Board of Governors of the IAEA and a good number of 35 countries represented had no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, as the diplomat who gives réflechir: " At this point, if in the end they are "
The love in time of war
It goes wrong since that Angelina Jolie made its debut in the summer as a film maker.
She wrote the script itself: this is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian rights.
It knows nothing about this story, but it is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumour suggests that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love his executioner Serbia during the war in Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some clips of film scheduled to Sarajevo were displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned in Hungary, but in post-production, protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a journal Bosnian, Bakira Hasecic organization of women victims of war has sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and it demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie is itself goodwill ambassador of the UNHCR.
It is not diplomat. A few weeks already, it has proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but those plate declined the offer.
" The meeting is due to be held in Bosnia, " says Hasecic.
There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie said enough about his attitude to the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently, recommended that the United Nations high commissioner to withdraw the quality of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
but, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie has written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, after some hesitation filming permission to Sarajevo, but we do not know why does not then come despite this authorization.
The young author is itself is not political goals with his film, that it is making great efforts that it is aware of the Yugoslav conflict. It supports it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all parties involved.
It remains vague about the content.
and a second synopsis of the film is running on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. It is again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim woman, was deported in the concentration camp Serb man working as guardian.
What constitutes a major difference with the version " a victim of rape is amourache his executioner.
What the film Jolie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, and expresses Jolie, is " unfair and based on information erronnées ."
The fanatical Hollywood can bring peace: The illegally this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let us!

The experts of the Institute of Economic and Social Research show that 100,000 Irish soon leave their countries.
They provide a number of 200 migrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts, it will be a migration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a great ease, grief is now the place.
The economic crisis, however, especially young people, well-trained, who have known so far that moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and the social deprivation seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, it is in excess money.
But, meanwhile, three out of ten people under the age of 30 years are unemployed.

For six months, Seán O 'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more they could do for this engineer for 29 years, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A house fashion fate precisely to (.
In January, it would continue to work on other projects Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O 'Donovan did not visit rarely his native country, because he is attending an additional work, in order to conclude to repay the credit contracted to build his house at home.
" The situation is already a bit daft ," says on the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
" I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost more. "
It breaks out of a laugh embarrassed by crossing the storerooms.
The house is located in a residential area with gardens to care, expensive cars leading brands are stationed on the roads.
Four years ago, O 'Donovan has bought the house in common with his sister for $380 000 euros, financed 100 per cent of the credit.
" It moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy ," he says.
Has fear of seeing any collapse because of credit?
O 'Donovan is a time, are getting hot tea and said: " I have no children and I am young; even so, I can start afresh. "
The engineer of the building does not like wailing that it often.
" Nobody should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as had once lived here in the island, supports it.
" for a time abroad, this is not what is worse, perhaps that is that we feel of all Irish.
He laughs and spoke to his father who went to England at the last great economic crisis.

The idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Leaving the future and discover how life is happening elsewhere.
In his record, already has a few years of working in London. That is why life is not as easy in New Zealand for him and his copine.
But there is still one thing he was concerned these last few days: in the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He feared that it could turn into evening farewell.
" Only, not many emotions ," he says with a long bursting beer.
" A goodbye, it seems even disturbing. "
" Call it rather an evening of farewell, any relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games. "
The democratic routine
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as to private enterprise.
The crime became greater concern that unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as influential as the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two elements in the poll results this year, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the enough sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support for democracy has risen significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the average (see chart 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region expressed satisfaction with the way in which democracy in their countries worked in practice; it was the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3)
Thirty-four percent said they had confidence in Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in significant increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have shaken the support to democracy.
If it stood during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a network of social security has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 per cent.)
But mood varies considerably from one country to another (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has resulted in a widespread feeling of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more harsh and violent crime has increased.
Only for the second time since the survey was started more than respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than the unemployment as the most important issue facing their countries (see chart 5).
About 31 per cent say that they or a close have been the victim of a crime over the past year; however, this figure is lower than the 38 per cent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise of support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for the development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58 per cent believed that the market economy is the only system that will make them developed countries, against 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62 per cent of respondents in Venezuela are of the opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many businesses closed.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent (up from 18 percent last year -RRB - followed by the USA (9% , unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9% , a decrease of 11% for the year)
but the United States is considered to be the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and throughout much of Central America, while Venezuela has this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote soiled
Nobody expected to have perfect general elections on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the " outsiders " who wanted to help the stricken country and plunged in fear.
The ballot boxes and a new election ballots scattered in the goutières, polling ransacked and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, roamed the neighbourhood to find where vote.
Some of them eventually abandon.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, have denounced the fraud and have called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official with the United Nations, said the event as " a pretty good in many respects election ."
observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean have carefully stated that they " believe that these irregularities, as serious, had necessarily invalidated the process ."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round expected is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be annulled.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, which has little or no visible support among voters, is said by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic, raging, and more than 1 million of the earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that the participation would.
Accordingly, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
About 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
The donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians are themselves.
The tip to the centre
weeks after becoming a suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, Argentine President, received a wave of public sympathy has improved its approval rate of 20 points, to over 50 per cent, its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet turn that into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, apparently in mourning, that it would abandon the intransigence of her late husband's predecessor, and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain unclear.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded as president, used to prepare budgets that underestimates the income tax, economic growth and inflation.
This gave the first couple to spend extra income at will.
The government of Ms. Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has collapsed in disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissident members of the movement péroniste in power have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a Parliamentary slapped in the face one of its peers and others have accused the government of corruption -RRB - the Congress does not have to approve the budget 2011.
" I will not argue, " said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President once more flexibility to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9 per cent this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1 per cent but many private estimates and wage demands of unions, see this figure close to 30% .
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic meltdown, has made a priority of growth and the reduction of poverty, rather than the control of inflation.
It has refused to deal with the IMF, it had harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, which had official falsifications of statistics on inflation.
Ms. Fernández can with moderate these policies?
It called for talks between the companies and union leaders.
And officials say they want to limit wage increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by high world prices for agricultural exports to Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
That is perhaps why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
. This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring of debt on which Argentina had not paid its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchner have always insisted that they could involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economics Minister, announced that the Fund would provide a " technical assistance " to develop a new national index of consumer prices; what appears to be a prelude to the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, including the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When Argentines are back from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have receded.
If it wants to win another election, it would have to decide whether to repudiate or not, quietly, many policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
The Taiwanese voters are geared towards a sort of closer links with the continent.
What is Taiwan think of her big brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters are presented on 27 November, 70% of people eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in the framework of what is regarded as a general evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. My itself became a substitute for the feelings of the continent, with links to innovative cases, including a free-trade pact, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five town halls, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the démocrate-progressiste (DPP -RRB - which has been tipped to full independence for Taiwan, has won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT 45 per cent.
If this had been a presidential ballot, Mr. My would be in difficulty.
since he was elected two years ago, by voting for his party has fallen by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event showed most of the main topics of Taiwan elections, including shadow campaign trucks and flags of mass rally with girls danced in minimum.
A mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, has done a tour for the KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. Lien, purely to the face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it has not been determined if the gunman was struggling to Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the murder has had an effect on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking the question of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have jouté with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan has usually independence and hate the military threat from China.
For example, the KMT tends to avoid parade, its ties with Beijing.
But this time plate, the DPP has also failed to fan the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, claimed a confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
can expect the Beijing Government continues to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan, to return home.
China has wasted no time to send a negotiator in Taipei to organize a summit on the protection of investments and the medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also see a political integration; but let the beginning.
Better to wait for it after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has in any case reinvented.
It two years ago, it was bad: its former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, it was a provocative in favour of independence.
But a new generation of moderate has emerged under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a candidate of the DPP to the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who has served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans to a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their discussions can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that his party present an alternative worthy of trust " by the hasty approach of Mr. My on China.
Mr. Chen is exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the DPP candidate would have achieved better results if they had stressed that Taiwan is a separate countries.
It has even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to seek the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP would find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT is introspection of oneself.
Assessments of Mr. My have been weak; despite a dramatic economic growth, the KMT candidate did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT said that his office and its local branches will be restructured.
the PDP good results suggest that the support of Taiwan for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese are economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, " the point of no return is already past. "
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the " best new artist
Endeavour at the request of a president, and people are required to take knowledge.
Esperanza Spalding, the bassiste jazz singer of 26 years picked by hand by President Obama to occur at the ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of best new artist ."
Considering that Spalding is a very well-known jazz scene since his 2008 album, " Esperanza, the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards in which an artist should not lift more than three albums before the recording, which was the identity of the artist. "
His ambitious album in 2010, " Chamber Music Society, was certainly a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly engaging, his hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding compared to the meteoric success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of Grammy Awards taking into account the production of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters of Grammy Awards have rightly honoured " Historicity " of Vijay Iyer Trio in " instrumental album, a transferred to a stirring invigorating record as one of the key favourite last year.

Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well deserved recognition in the large category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz Billy Childs Set and the eternal aventurier Dave Holland, whose album " Pathways " of its octet's live was a good example of the democratic control of this bassiste as head of group.

The draft of the mosque Temecula won the endorsement of the planning committee.
A draft mosque in Temecula has received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project, arguing that it was the promotion of terrorism that traffic congestion.
But the Commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious centre in local laws and that it would be esthétiquement impressive.
" A lot of people are to: Christians, Jews, Baha 'is, you say, " said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
" I am proud, as a US citizen. "
" This shows that justice prevails. "
" The opposition is really small, " he added.
" They just have very strong voice. "
" We have good people in this valley. "
The meeting started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with most of the time, people voting for or against the centre, the time to almost equally divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate has continued on the website of the newspaper.
" There was more of America, " wrote one speaker.
" It is another Planet of the Apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand. "
" America. "
Islamic centres planned have also prompted protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.

His congregation of 135 families co-existe without incident in the Riverside County for years but wanted a space more and better than the warehouse leased on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque 24.943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style consisting of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would be a 4.32 site acres on the road Nicolas about two miles east of the school Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this draft on the City Council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the scope to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered bacteria unusual here on Earth, they say it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been regarded as essential.
" This body has a dual capacity. "
" It can be developed with phosphorous, with arsenic. "
" That is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life really " foreign ," commented on Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday in the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to grow after replaced the phosphorus arsenic.
" One wonders what is still possible, " said Ariel Anbar D. University of Arizona State, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, about what life is, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
however, announced a press conference to discuss, who did not disclose details of the discovery, has led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of alien life.
This has not been the case.
The discovery shows that, in other global environments, the agencies might be able to use other elements to activate the biochemistry and that the whole " standard ," that we are absolutely necessary for life, could not be established ," commented on Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of scientific research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
" This work is again because it shows the substitution of a fundamental element to the other in biochemistry and the biochemical structure, added Cockell.
This was not an accidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon Institute of Astrologie NASA, which conducted the study, has chosen the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it has speculated that microbe exposed to two substances might be able to substitute.
" The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to that of phosphorus. "
" As a result, the agencies have difficult to separate these elements separately. "
" But arsenic is sufficiently different to that it is not working exactly as phosphorus; it cuts inside and, in a way, gum the biochemical machine, " said Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed to increased concentrations of arsenic that she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic to place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic may occur naturally, is also on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the earth, it says, researchers have speculated that the first forms of life could have used.
This suggests that there may be other ways of life, not just how life on Earth was formed early, " said Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two exhibition stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The other two dogs exhibition on four stolen from outside a motel to Bellflower were found, sheriffs in Los Angeles County have anoncé Thursday.

They were meeting on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at an animal shelter in the county to Downey.
The deputy sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a male of 3 years, and Didi, a female 10 months - were unharmed, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional support this week for the Japanese owners of dogs, were missing until they were discovered on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the championat national AKC/Eukanuba " of Long Beach, where they intended to present Trace.
other dogs were due to take part in competitions of other provisions in the days before the exhibition " AKC/Eukanuba ," said Peek in the Times on Wednesday.
The southern California is one of the travelling exhibition canine for almost a month.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and garent their van to the outside, next to the window of their house.
They took three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a épagneul Breton - who have stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, the thick fur, in the van when it would be more costs.
They have a little open windows, so that the dogs may have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van to 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward for anyone who could lead to corgis with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to be ashamed of, the restructuring of GMMs no longer expected that the final green light for the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, GMMs finally got the green light to begin to zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, was officially hired Thursday, the plan pré-emballés " by the creditors that approximately $5 billion of debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the entertainment business, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and TV shows.
With the decision Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the bankruptcy code of the United States, no legal obstacles remain before GMMs to stay afloat under the guardianship of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General of what will be a studio eased.
The staff will be reduced to approximately 320 on 400.
GMMs will not really Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase has not reached a credit facility of $500 million to finance the new operations and production of GMMs.
It is being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which has itself to $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis& Co. , has been committed to advise the direction on how to put its finances as it did not have the means to pay the interest amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, the director general, Harry he was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery, known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts to Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of GMMs and meet more than 140 creditors of studio have taken much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, by the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
however, the auction has attracted few bidders which none of them was willing to pay $2 billion more for creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, again while the GMMs team had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, has finally been approved by creditors at the end of October.
When GMMs fate officially bankruptcy in the following weeks, companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis& Co. , which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper enterprises, which raised $375 per month for their leadership of the company, will receive a bonus of success " of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account revive GMMs production, which is released only one movie this year, and put up a list of seven or eight films come from 2012.
They also intend to co-financing two movies based on " Hobbit ," with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan of $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be done by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which holds about 18 per cent of the debt of GMMs, has tried to achieve a merger of studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies had not led to an agreement.
Jouets Tech to maintain your budget in balance gifts
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed perhaps by the video game system from Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a significant hole in your budget gifts.
Look at that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five bikes BMX to $99 and a game Kinect cost the same price that 10 ropes to leapfrog classic pearls, or approximately 48 clubs Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance gifts.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys " R " Us and Wholesale Club BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more strength; and cost the same price if not a little less, compared with last year.
In addition, when there is typically less than new toys associated with Web sites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more.
And toys to button cells are increasing, and toys to rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys " R " Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are toys in the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press on the belly.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second is composed a song.
If you buy more, they sing in harmony.
Caution: once you start to support, you can you stop.
In order to combine the song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for two and more) is the best choice.
Guided by the technology of Elmo Live last year, the doll animatronique 14 inches plays games turn as Simon Says and can make the lunar dance through its innovative articulated feet with lock.
Children who have essyaé toy uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall of Alphie, one of the first automated educational toys.
It is return (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more -RRB - with a backpack filled with cards game questionnaire designed to transform a car outing in a session with a auto-correction and good valves.
If you are wary when your child is your smartphone, three alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech ($ 60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($ 70, for the 3 to 12 years -RRB - it is the first major revision of the range Leapster, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is consistent with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($ 90, for 3 to 7 years) uses a system like iTunes to provide electronic games and books and has an entry for SD card which allows to post photographs of the family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a box to match, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to train in placing online blocks before the time passes, it is ideal for a spelling unprepared.
Increasingly, toys have a sort of online connection.
In basis that their presence in the toy stores, the two biggest Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 " Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years) that includes a room marked a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough to store Club Penguin for two articles in the choice.
It may be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
slightly greater than the rifle at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10 for 5 years and more) is the last micro-robots cell button.
The false bestiole move quickly on 12 pasta implants alive in directions random.
It is amusing to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a temporary shift in our dog bite.
Providing more mild side order in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait a seat of the city as a sergeant urban training severely inspecting its nerve charges, with softly orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - big responsible public order in China, feared and scorned for their arbitrary punishment and their propensity for violence - send some impression in a set of spectators.
" Stand right! "
" Be perçantes! "
Show them, he says, " the beautiful girls! "
Four girls who barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and trousers of olive colour, is figeaient in nicely.
Four pairs of black shoes to heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly! summit hair attached by a wiped out in blue and white.
" Personally, I think they have an average appearance ," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
" The models are nice. "
More than a government tried to refresh the image of urban inspectors to China.
town has required that all new recruits have a degree of study.
The Guangdong province has exchanged the gris-vert uniforms against a blue supposedly more.
Wuhan in central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by the hard way: in 2009, the report noted that 50 officers surrounded a trolley to snack uncontrollable with black eyes, strongly for a half hour, until the colporteur remballe business and bottom-up.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a major operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its police street in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police dégrossie a side softer, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty in attracting the grey light on this urban brigade of China
And because, critics say.
Contrary to the police, officers are allowed to enforce the municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the new a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Hubei province have beaten to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
last year, a training manual for the inspectors of Beijing, stolen and posted online, outlines how defeat effectively offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a colporteur of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a scuffle with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online shows Chinese inspectors trained to street vendors.
" Chengguan marked the Government ," lamented the year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy on the tactics.
The newspaper claimed a " cleansing. "
Skeptics say the approach is far.
After the district spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, was asked if the women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The District required female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years, have a great figure and the five features face in the right order. "
They should be larger than the average, or 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The pension 26 years is compulsory.
officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
" It is their image is important ," said some district officer at Rednet. com, a Web site quasi-gouvernementale.
" First, qualities external candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, features face, etc. "
Then have the temperament and the " internal qualities. "
Women of Chengguan are as vessels, he said, adding: " In addition to be vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the office of the district of the city, does not subscribe to that description.
But he noted that the height were the norm standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the exigeance on features of the face.
What this means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Yes, people with disabilities or disfigured should not apply.
" We cannot allow a person who box or a bossu next serve ," said Mr. Zheng.
" It would not give a good image. "
Liu Yi, who patrol on the place Baoguang almost a monastery, is aged 22 and cheeks pommelées with a mouth finely incurvées.
It does not see the value of their appearance as sexist, at it.
" Do you think I look sexy in the uniform? ' she asked a disillusioned.
Xu Yang, his colleague in the fossettes aged 21 years, said: " Our job is to make the image of the city. "
They do not oppose that its mandate is limited, they said, because they have more career ambitions than simply drive sellers in the alleys where they are expected to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell the maximum bread rolls or bowls of tofu before flight.
" Master Wang, you must. "
" We you have already said several times! " said Ms. Xu while a seller had fled on foot, leaving temporarily its vélo-charrette to nouilles.
agents describe their functions rather monotonous that difficult.
" That is about the same thing every day, " said Huang Jing, aged 20 years studying the marketing after work.
" Great routine. "
One of the reasons is that women do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the assets of sellers.
They can only threaten violators to their superiors.
This tends to protect public exhibitions sudden animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread false rumours that officers chengguan had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of chengguan were injured, 14 of government vehicles were toppled or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of the quiescent place Baoguang, where female officers were patrolling this morning -là, over 50 people gathered around the corner.
agents confiscated a motorcycle which was being repaired on the pavement, rather than in a shop, as under the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle criait scandal.
A tug-of-war for 15 minutes followed before the police, face disaster, has to bend to their vehicle and left with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, committed to the male team coordinator, remained behind, his white returned to hide his name badge.
As the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - are purely a support role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain an image cirée.
" Sometimes we are fighting words. "
" Sometimes we fight physically ," said Mr Li said of a neutral tone.
" Most of the time, it is the public that begins. "
Prosecutors do not inculperont not Senator Ensign
The Ministry of Justice prosecutors have lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, arising out of a case linked to a assistant a former campaign and in its efforts to obtain a lobbying for the husband of the woman, have anoncé Wednesday, lawyers Senator.
The decision brings to a close the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican Nevada which was seen as a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential until the scandal surrounding his case to make headlines national last year and damage to his career.
Mr. room Ensign said he was " very pleased " with the decision, the result of a survey a year.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign stated that the Ministry of Justice had " informed that Senator Ensign was more investigation and that it did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case. "
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement has come as something of a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice that there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to earn the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in the case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer during a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of donors policies to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying for them; according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the lobby of his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence has been made public, " there seems to be a prima facie case of conspiracy to rape and serious violation of the law of the revolving door, " said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the Government.
Although the judge Ministry has refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the Ministry appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of setbacks cashed high-level its public integrity section, including the decision last year to dismiss the case against the former senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct prosecution.
federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie he, the Director-General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
" This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don 't apply to them, " she added.
Paul Coggins, principal of Mr. lawyer Ensign, said in an interview that he had received on Monday, a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and monitoring the following day, saying that the ministry did not seek charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the Senator, as his office has reaffirmed Wednesday, in a statement, " had acted in accordance with the law. "
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments it had made to the service.
" I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we believe that they took the right decision ," at.
last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an independent investigation following a complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96.000 by parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that it had insufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a Nevada who has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign assisted Mr. Hampton to find lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company hosted Mr Hampton as a lobbyist, the head of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, provided with Mr. Hampton and told her that he " martelait " the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer in Nevada, Allegiant Air, and it has asked the secretary of transport to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after hired Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When the new case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post of leader the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, has said that the senator had hoped that the ethics committee quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, said.
The appeal of Cheshire league table to Twitter
A handful of them were kick away in rows of the courtroom.
They send all minutes of reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a house was set on fire.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of a Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to a formal end where the judge imposed the death sentence passed by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already filed the court that outlines the appeal to the courts for years.
What is provocative, is that the intense reports on the trial - and the widespread use and extended by journalists of Twitter - have created an atmosphere of circus, a saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury was not influenced by the passions of the public.
The demand could push the appeal judges to discuss the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
" I experienced at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom violates human rights to a fair trial, " said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. blue Superior Court has their answers rejected the claims in the judgment last week, saying that the media were " carefully controlled " and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that does not appear to be the last word on the issue.
The appellate courts recognize for decades that the media coverage of the notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a trial of 1966, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a ostéopathe Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, in its decision that there was a " carnival atmosphere " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television and film " The fugitive.
Some lawyers have said that appellate courts to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the media courtroom, unimaginable to the case of Dr. Sheppard.
" There is a reason to worry about the impact of new media in the trial of major, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Law who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeal judges may be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the courtroom could lead to more fair trials.
Twitter case is only one of many described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed during the years; delaying the execution.
defence lawyers say also, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered injury when the judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reaction of potential jurors in lurid photos of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some jurors said they had been horrified by the photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years ago.
defence lawyers argue that they are also challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge wrongly deported one juror, which had been critical to prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual decision to persuade the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors had not been kidnapped.
But their arguments on the intense media coverage of the trials could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month that dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the post of governor and U.S. Senate.
They have maintained that the computer media continued to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
" The scramble daily tweets media, cameras and journalists to the palace of justice ," said lawyers, " not resembled nothing had been seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level. "
Their emphasis on the system Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the affirmation that the new instant were more incendiary that releases handed over more slowly, was a luddiste that much diminished the Court policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have said that the call étaitent often lured by arguments that the social and technological change required an adjustment by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard in media coverage of the trial and they indicated that they invoke the need of new rules for the new media.
" This case ," said they ," is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell in the 21st century. "
The civility can bring the divisions?
After a campaign marked by the invective and the negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation or an illusory time before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the session of " lame duck ."
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion on differences of both parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibility, rather than another episode where each side to score points. vacuum rating point supporter.
Wednesday public meeting of the committee on the deficit of President was equally civilized, despite political differences remain between the States.
It seems clear that the interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of testing and tested mutual for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a partisan war renewed.
That is why the meeting Tuesday and the subsequent comments of participants have unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the environment that existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, costs, health care or the rights, the two parties are miles away.
Yet, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
" There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone, " said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now in the Centre of ethical and public policy.
" It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections raise partisan passions and then they estomptent.
That is good. "
on certain issues, including those on the agenda of the " lame duck ," Republicans and Democrats had no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
The two parties want to find a way to preserve some or all, temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not least because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing the unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, more optimism over a possible agreement on issues raised during the session on the " lame duck ," with the ratification of the pact " New START.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warns that a successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session " blade duck " does not ménera not necessarily better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
" Once the things that need to be made for the psychology in the short term will be one of confrontation, " he said.
Wehner has also expressed scepticism widely shared view that civilisation would lead to genuine cooperation.
" I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event in 2012, at.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and voters who tea that contributed to its creation.
However Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they should try to live up to their promise to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the committee of the deficit which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes, raise the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
The co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles has chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and themselves, imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in committee, made up of 18 members, to make their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have been struggling to reach this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that it on tax issues, at least today, few grounds or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will next year in the form of clashes supporters, given that the Republican contest Obama budget, taxes and health care; and then be followed by a period of great bipartisan cooperation.
What is the cause of change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, when the two parties will observe carefully public reaction.
Anyone deemed in loss should change course and compromise.
But this would be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and the polarization are higher today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a more ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, militants from both parties see 2010 as a prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that divide them yet.
American documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
the city control is in the hands of a " Kleptocratie " and until Kremlin party bribes and protection of the money collected, reported the United States Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are enormous racketeering that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They have the money not only of legitimate companies but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the " vertical of power " - takes its share money ensue towards the top of the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington as the Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names have been removed.
It was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
It was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been few traces of cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won many defamation trial on those charges.
In September, it said a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: " This is crazy, it is to throw is anything. "
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
but it is unusual to find the information contained in a report embassy; and it is astounding that this would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to appoint " dysfunctional " and that the government was more like a kleptocracy, a government ," according to the notes of the embassy.
" criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " (a term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " roof or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB -RRB - the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
" The analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow. "
" Luzhkov is the summit. "
" The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level. "
" Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level. "
" It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide some services. "
The report states that the FSB has the money of the largest companies and that police targeted small.
A source, he said, " that the owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups), because they have more weapons, more resources and more power than the criminal groups but they are also protected by the law. "
" That is why the protection by criminal gangs is not as high. "
The note said that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times the fight against corruption but admitted the lack of progress.
note of the embassy transmits records of men who make bags, probably full of money, until the Kremlin.
" In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats ," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of think tank Indem ."
" But it is part of the bureaucracy. "
" It is not part of a political class because they do not Russia. "
Without the political opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount to Russia, to more than $300 billion a year.
has been ranked 154th in a recent poll on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are at least more corrupt).
note disclosure of the American embassy, which was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will leave no with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, to the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in solving the problem.
When interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin has suggested that the documents of WikiLeaks could be manufactured and reacted with anger to the point that US diplomats had disclosed in the Batman and Robin Medvedev.
" The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, important factor of domestic politics in this country, he said.
" but to be honest with you, we suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics. "
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly informed with concrete walls derelict sheds of poor quality, the director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng referred to the man who had built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
" Everyone here like Ta Mok. "
" It was a good leader; and he cared for his people, " said Sreng Kor My, aged 42.
Known as " the butcher " for its brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia where it has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
This year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the Government, the loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation has allowed victims to respond publicly to people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of his former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, made its first award on a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former leader of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
Faced with these developments, the anxiety has increased to veterans of the Khmer Rouge to Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate into society.
" resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything, " said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
" For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. "
" The situation creates divisions within families. "
Under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here, they launched an insurgency that has lasted until the last of the movements visit in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary ran the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
, however, in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters Khmer Rouge have begun to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulations Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, which had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most veterans of the Khmer Rouge have sunk in abject poverty, common in rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some officers elite Khmer Rouge have kept their posts of local leader in exchange for the weapons, it is not qualified farmers on low rank and file.
" These people have received very little follow-up after the capitulation, " said Sok Leang Centre for justice and reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
" They are soaked with environmentally ideology utopian land regime. "
" They were high in a framework in which to do business is a foreign concept. "
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
" The life under the Khmer Rouge was good, " he said.
" Ta Mok has everyone. "
But now, life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused concern here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the trial of Nuon Chea Khieu Samphan, and Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge.
The Court's mandate is to try senior leaders of the crimes but it has not said if he continued beyond these four cases.
It needed more to calm fears to Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation turned towards Im Chaem, aged 64, former head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers Documentation Centre of Cambodia that it had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of workers forced died.
recently at a torrid evening, Im Chaem amounted to field near its wooden house on poles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the grass desséchée, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, it says, it refuses to go.
" Cambodia is peaceful and stable " at it.
" If there was more to stay, there will be war. "
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability could happen if the court had several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
" Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past at.
But the past is all that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
" The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said.
" We must put the pieces together so that we can understand. "
The centre has produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, " A history of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages. "
It distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people Anlong Veng are only a few details of the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school Anlong Veng, said that the new book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
" My family rejected many parts of the handbook and the court, " he said.
" They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue. "
Such resistance has made the complex and difficult reconciliation process, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court is beginning to have an impact, at.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a atrait powerful here.
In the mountains of Dangrek, a road, invaded by weeds and littered with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, under a tin roof rouillée.
The body of Pol Pot was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, age 31, selling mobile phones in roadside, has said that she did not know very little about the man who has been cremated.
" But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to ask, said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day -là, it plans to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where it would leave a mature mix of bananas in the hope of providing the opportunity.
Belarus is prepared to give up its stock of uranium
the Belarus government has announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, a key ingredient to the nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on the Council.
The US government had tried for years to persuade the Belarus to renounce the highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But American officials have told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus in the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of uranium from a research centre of Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of about £ 500, according to an official who spoke about the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Safety Summit of 47 nations, held at the initiative of Obama; Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
" I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the summit of nuclear security of 2012 nuclear Council Summit. "
" It is evidence that this process works, " said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group of nuclear safety.
Clinton has called the agreement " very significant, important " by the Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
The Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
When Summit on the nuclear safety of Obama, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, stated that the nation would agree not to its uranium.
" We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially of uranium and low-enriched uranium ," he told Mr. Lukashenko.
" This is our product. .. We are not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone. "
" We are going to use for research purposes. "
Belarus is close to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implemented to eliminate uranium Belarus, in October, has been particularly complicated because the material had been slightly spent, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train who has travelled more than 1 300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second round was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The US government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace the research of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; inadequate for the weapons.
" A careful coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen the confidence "; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a department of energy specialist in the World Threat Reduction.
According to Study Centre estimates of Nonprolifération James Martin, the Belarus this year at least 88 pounds of uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
The Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
" While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens ," she said.
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights
The Government has no objection to the CIA flights with prisoners Taliban and Al Qaeda in leadership Guantanamo in Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks daily El País, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time -là, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Commission Spanish informed for " pouvoir'démontrer they had a proper vigilance on the foreign aircraft travelling through Spain ."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe who accused of complicity in contrary to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, there had been a meeting between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice-President has acknowledged that the report of the Council had surprised the Zapatero Government offside " and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
" The Vega stressed that Spain has no objection regarding intelligence flights by top Spanish territory. "
" They want to be informed " to avoid being " take unawares ," recounted Aguirre in a cable.
The Ministry of Externe this time -là, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador has reported that the Spanish executive wanted to give to this case is as low as possible, although, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence ."
In turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that it did not block the initiative of Judge of the declassification of documents of the Centre National Intelligence (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
" The reports do not contain any incriminating, no sensitive information, " said the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States showed when even their concern for the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors German " for the information déclassifiée of CNI o the Ministry of Defence.
" This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between the Governments, regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internes, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the plate he commented that " even if the Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence and what they consider appropriate ," he had instructed his staff to avoid the comments of an overheated rhetoric, trying to rebaisser temperature.
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the PP in this case.
" In spite of its thrust pro-American, our experience suggests that PP certainly will benefit from any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations -là have negative consequences for the Government of the United States ," said.
The parricide from confessions complained in " too became bored " to be mother
The girl spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: " Terror to the Galician "
Monica Juanatey Fernández is " Muki " in the network.

Members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in Congress, and CCS loses 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members in the last elections autonomous, the Catalan PP has already referred the general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, because the number of votes that this training in these Family Code double normally she receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 general, while the autonomous in 2006, they had 316.222.
On Sunday, past the CPP won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend, desired a diversion of CCS votes and the retention of the electorate the PP and the training analysts have calculated that, if there is general elections, the CPP could from 8 to 12 MEPs in the Congress, while CiU increase by four (it now has 10) and CCS loses no more and no less than nine (25).
These calcules would see that Catalan is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
analysis of popular ERC would lose a Member - it has three now - while COLI would keep a Member or gain a.
but if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for Family Code municipal, where popular can also be crucial at the end of the Socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations handling the budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that CCS could lose the mayor in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the Socialists would the majority the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and COLI.
In light of the Republican debacle, it is not fanciful that this training to lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5 per cent of votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to CCS, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
The popular recorded the progress in other municipes as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to lists in a maximum number of locations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
by seven prisoners in Barcelona in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian prisoners by agents of the station General Information Police Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaeda, which " The Tigers to the Earth Liberation Tamil " (LTTE) and " Laskar e Taiba " (Let -RRB - the latest being the author of the Mumbai terrorist attacks which have killed 103 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internes gave a great importance to these investigations, the fact that with the operation Kampai " has " been stupidity " the falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and " therefore, its capacity operative ."
investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it has been active in Catalonia, has been sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged and then distributed to groups that incorporated the galaxy criminal Al Qaeda for its fighters to the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled unit is the only that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, which is why in the investigations, part of Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be days following similar blows to the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (it has detained the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade -RRB - in Thailand was held another, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who led since Bangkok cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was flying mostly tourists passports who meet the conditions marked by the named " Front Islamic World ."
That perceivable documents should be to young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with valid for several years and without visas estampées.
investigators point out that so far there is no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, although the author of this attack, " Laskar e Taiba ," was one of the groups receiving stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
however it must be recalled that a few days before that this attack was committed, Catalonia are sent through an agency transfers a few miles from $" invested " to buy mobile maps have been used after the ingrained in the raid that killed 100 people.
Police seized numerous documents.
PP asked Mas suspend the complicity
PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to expose personal Artur Mas its conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philo-souverainistes as the economic complicity is that the nationalist leader wants to discuss half of its mandate.
The President of popular Catalan arrived in rendezvous with Artur Mas with security now having reached 18 MEPs at the elections Sunday, more than enough to love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training that the opposition will refrain in the voting for the inauguration.
In a possible agreement with the PP depend on future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are key Catalan.
And regarding the PP, to support an inauguration should be eliminating all speech separatists and independence ," and the complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converge wants to submit even in the referendum.
The two leaders share a common commitment to make weight loss policy administration autonomique very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied in succession and donations.
details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas will be part of PC, Jordi Comet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (CCS), which has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (CPI) and today it will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC -RRB - Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric contends that the deaths were not due to " lack of action "
centre owners of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that night nurse has killed 11 people
The geriatric The Caritat of Olot (Gerona) have offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution of criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 people for which he is responsible in the meantime he has worked.
residence director, Joan Sala, was accompanied by a lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that " the desire of The Caritat is to exercise the accusation against the responsible " for the deaths, but " the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the continuation of civilian officials ."
And part of the discredited social entity can suffer for not detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the greatest threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from this day -là it has not ceased to kill.
Judge mentioned in the award he ordered the exhumation of eight body - former patients of geriatric - care suspected in many cases no Dr. explored the deceased but, given the age and the health of patients, the event was held by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied yesterday that situation and mentioned that " the lack of measures may not have been the cause of what happened ."
lawyer The Caritat added that " in this case only an index of negligence on the part of anyone else that the accused.
The person already known as the Angel of Death confessed yesterday 11 murders and explained that he had committed the crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In that case, it caused the death in injecting a sobre-dose insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of tablets sedatives.
The director of The Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access center staff medicine.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism used in six of nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila is not lying in saying that it has sought for its first victims a less cruel death or contrary has burned in the giving laundry as it has already confessed that he has done with the three women killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, the number of murders confessed, they cannot eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after committing successfully eight killings.
That is why they say they will remain available justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday Trichet warned that " markets should not underestimate our ability to react. "
The differential of peripheral have closed for the force and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5 per cent.
, however, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to be wrong and the euro has barely registered a increment, which is a signal anxious.
What happened yesterday is typical of a market that in the same way that it collapses, it will recover, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor soon to lose the fear.
One month ago, ECB gave us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the acquisition plan of public debt because of inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that extends the current liquidity measures " at least until March and maintain the auction quarterly unlimited access to the rest of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the programme of obligations and even the signal to intensify.
If they fail the expectations generated, they will overturn with the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their meeting in May in which they said that they had not even considered purchasing and they have to fail the markets, history may repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it was announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday, said that he had already bought much, causing a collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of trafficking a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million 5.28% compared to 750 million 4.81% the previous auction.
Even so, types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points in the curve, and reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet words.
In Ireland it was published figures hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a delay until February to obtain private capital or they would be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not having discovered the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in the Plan of assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate tone of his speech to ease tensions before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise which demonstrates that we are a union and that we understand all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President took the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers agree on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment ring to ouïes investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains why the Spanish stock has suffered the 4.5 per cent, double the rest of EU grants.
At difference in February, the response from the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the surprise.
Today there is a enchère-clé an obligation to three years for debt by the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that the plate be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about the ability of refinancing.
For Spain request a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 000 million in available liquidity, the triple by March, very expensive types and they cut access sine die.
however, the strategy must continue to be one of the wife of Caesar ," the ."
Courage, we can leave!

Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull es entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of the speed has been marked by surprise and the success.
In a first time, nobody has taken into account the options of a new stable which had just happen, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without down the skill as pilot champion, the German Sebastien Vette, the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 legend spoke of the " secret weapon " that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful software simulation process that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of the top-class automobilistique.
Appointed PLM, this powerful instrument technology has been used to create networks of mounting manufacturing factories, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before the construction of a real, thereby avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi or more famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, said the fact that the use of this instrument in its plant in Formula 1 has helped Red Bull to create and execute " in for a few hours, almost in real time ," the changes, changes and improvements detected during racing and tests.
Russwurm explained that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team are now working 180 young professionals from high qualifications which, powerful computer equipment and are planning any sort of changes on the bolides.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of bolides of Red Bull except the engine, which is solely responsible for Renault.
We change the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security.
The can move from the virtual reality of reality simulator in less than 24 hours, through advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves high technology.
As single limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of 40 million dollars each team Formula 1 can spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the high technology to create and produce its bolides in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that is happening there is considered " top secret ."
The personnel for this duty account 580 people, ci-inclus two pilot, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 Red Bull, perhaps, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the tremendous technological resources that the energy drinks is at the service of its participation in the channels, there are other hidden actors, whose work is invaluable and zero visibility.
factory technology director, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago you could say that the progress of R+D in racing cars were the 50 per cent of victories and the pilot were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while the pilot make the 15% of the value added.
Nevey admit that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because " they are unpredictable gladiators.

Sabadell is betting on 'voler' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic that other leaders, the Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
notwithstanding, it provides a collapse of interest margins, that it will try to help offset with increments of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expect capture in three years a million individual customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit during the next three years and to be able to survive as well in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will march 2011 a new master plan which will hold an will labilité for three years.
The goal, in part to survive without the need to resort to public subsidies of FROB, winning a symbol of market by capturing a million new customers - 700,000 if into those who can break the bank - its great task, because the bank had spoiled the more PMEs and companies that particular client.
This year it has picked up 250,000 customers and 50,000 societies.
The symbol of individuals market is 3.5 per cent, while the companies it exceeds 10% .
A further plan 2011-2013 is a bet on productivity, or is the same thing, austerity with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations are explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks will now set goals and make public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise this year its master plan Optima, makes it gets four years ago, even though originally plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further year.
Customers, releasing the funds savings are its main objective.
During breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola has insisted that 2011 will be a " difficult and transcendental ."
The Executive, believe that the crisis in Spain " will be slow ."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be very difficult to create jobs ," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, has insisted.
And even if he thinks the war liabilities - which penalises margins - is the price of risk premiums that banks and funds to pay for emissions for liquidity move already price of credit to offset the fall of margins.
" The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit. "
" We have not closed the valve, but the differences are more senior has recognized Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 novembre-.
He confessed that the trend in the banking sector now is to increase the commissions ," but " there is a competitive framework ."
The master plan Sabadell based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
This is not in vain that in Spain " would seek larger dimensions. "
" Any will move next year, assured.
It affirms that the needs of capital increase drastically " and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And the FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the new recapitalization.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance that some bank predict already as a new liquidity crisis.
said that we cannot issue, but rather what happened in June, we can obtain financing in the short term at rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among funds
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and insisted the speed with which perform the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of Spanish savings funds began, there have been several entities that have assured us that they will not participate in this first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
However, director general of the Confederation Spanish of fund Épargnes (ECSC -RRB - José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday the possibility of this new wave of operations.
" I think most of the mergers has been achieved, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Civic is a second phase are adjustments. "
" Most has been completely; it is possible that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but the process has been made already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who worked much in this operation also stressed the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of leaders and Exécutifs of Aragón (ADEA -RRB - Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is " the greatest possible speed and we must be very pleased with the way it is in the time that we have in the past, not now, in the plans with the Bank of Spain ," has emphatisé.
" The passage of 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 per cent to much more in line with Basel ," said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that " there are a number of relatively little positive views on the slow process " to show " a lack of sérosité and ," because " that the Bank of Spain made recall that we must respect the time before the end of the year.
The CEO of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, provided yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system any Europe and " probably " of the world and it has applied to people who are in a " lack of knowledge ."
The leader mentioned that given the current economic conditions, " we can remain very quiet " with the situation of financial entities and boxes of savings, a system which began a process of concentration " very important " and " goes to the greatest possible speed ."
He reiterated that the Spanish banking sector has been well of stress tests that the ECB has done in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to stay with the euro, but it establishes the conditions throughout the Union.
Tensions markets have led to a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax cuts for the PMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of 426 aid for the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, airport management Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of Loteries of the State.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its forthcoming policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of his future, which shocked with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Given the European resistance, in Germany began to speculate on the three possible exit to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among others, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, although now it seems of science fiction, with a favourable opinion, almost a 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a new approach to the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater control macroeconomic budgetary rigour, fines on countries that infringe, possible suspensions of payments and the private sector expansion potential costs of adjustments.
The German position is clear and that is that it is therefore now there is no place for an apology.
First, in 2009, when the IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of difference between what Germany believed that we should make (plans fiscal rigour and stability of public finances and its European partners, ci-inclut France.
The second of Central was when Merkel has barely extended the decision saved Greece.
From the moment -là it was the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel reiterated a clear position, in calling for the reform of the European treaties in order to make possible the rescue of a country, and at the same time to private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This has been interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the crisis in Ireland and the rest.
But its proposal, although a toned down, has been approved and, the following month, we should attend the process of reform of the Union which is possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has charted a red line that she did not think cross.
And it said that, although now it must take measures with which we may not be too much agreement, from that date the former functioning of the euro would end.
2013 will mean the creation of a new currency area, in which the countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default and, in this case -là, the private sector will also cost advantage.
Germany we said that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and the construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as those who chaired the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The development is clear.
And it would be difficult not to hear.
It is not only to extend the budget deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And it must absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence are coming to us tranquillity.
And knowing seize the opportunity that has been given until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard this form and its dual statement (promised reforms after the meeting of the past Saturday with big business and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, opened the way to the thesis that it must be in the house.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is there, and they seem to move.
among the possibilities that, we cannot exclude that abandoning a monetary area too packed with less serious.
And in this case -là, Germany we can always say that we had warned.
Sport and fraud law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not escape punishment.
The expulsion hatched in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) for the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused much ink on the nature anti-sportif such behaviour and if the two players should be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, a few minutes before the conclusion of the match (that their team already earned clearly -RRB - the two players have deliberately lost the time when they have been negligent to determine the arbitrator of the second yellow card.
Thus, and as Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players with the regulatory sanction for the next match match barrage against Auxerre and can pass without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA has punished with two matches of the team coach, José Mourinho and are economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as plate or similar is not new, but rather in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of non-écrites, but followed, of the sport.
Part of the debate in the case reflected at the fact that this has been leading a team of Real Madrid's entity (which in its anthem is the nobility and the honour and that in the past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, which adds an episode of its dilatée history of technician histrionique and provocative.
In any event, the debate whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the settlement contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions have made a fraud; because, in effect, they are friendly with the sport, but seem to avoid.
will consider the type of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
A property that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions had not been put in danger, that is, there has not been a violent game.
Another property to be referred to the game right is the team of players offenders would an unjust for the team, which is not the case.
however, the absurd of players of Real Madrid is that it is not what is normally characterised as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of rules has not been conducted in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but has tried to be as clear as possible to receive the criminalization of the referee.
They were waiting and they have gladly accepted the punishment.
Another issue is the kind of advantage that the offenders are considered willful misconduct.
Here it seems necessary to note that we are not in a situation of disadvantage to rival and is an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action involves leaving their own team with players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without boxes that can threaten their participation in a future match.
but it is a long-term benefit, with a degree of uncertainty because the team could be eliminated to and from that, with this action the players are doing a match penalty and spend the second cycle of boxes, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of boxes with a less than in the first round.
So, ladder, it is not clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part strategic decision-making that promote the use of rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of fraud law -RRB - m otherwise they chose the moment in which they are subjected to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwart the penalty or flee the -là.
Even if the border between Engineering and fraud is, in this opportunity I think was a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, I believe, is because of two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and conveying the guidelines for the cause.
The harm to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.

The Pakistani nuclear programme generates a great concern in the United States
Islamabad product of atomic weapons at a more rapid pace than that other countries ."
The leaching of Wikileaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the United States State Department filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous concern in Washington the Pakistani nuclear programme.
In the enlightening and tasty that offer details on the content of conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents show that the cooperation between the two countries in the area of security, rather than increase, " falling " and that the volatile Asian countries producing nuclear weapons " at a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser James Jones: " The proximity of nuclear facilities of the country under Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials that short and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear materials.
The large number of people involved in nuclear weapons and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferate and a reason to maintain custody.
Pakistan was hiring staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear or missile programmes, " said the expert Yuri Korolyov, the Ministry of Externes Russian during a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is cooperation more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of production of nuclear armas.
A dispatch from the embassy in May, which qualifies as " frustrating " communication with Pakistan, argues that: " The transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated.
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, said that " despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produced nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
The Ambassador Patterson also asked in Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, to " understand very clearly to that " Pakistan Army must end with the tacit support to groups terrorists ."
In the hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for counter-terrorism to prevent infiltration.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and locate to Assange.
All aspects Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a " red alert " for " locate and monitor the movements of Assange.
however, it is not a traditional arrest.
In addition, the plate is not new, but it datte on 20 November.
And plate has nothing to even with the last filtration of more than a quarter million United States diplomatic documents but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, said that " the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange ."
The 20 police international headquarters in Lyon, France has dictated the request of Sweden, but it has not made public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, 188 countries Interpol received the information to identify and locate Assange " for its provisional arrest and extradition.
Although Interpol could not give the order to arrest a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a way for the arrest --que the national police bodies must realize, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where we believe that Assange.
The movement has outraged lawyers of Assange, yesterday issued a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has shown willingness to respond by video conference with the Swedish authorities.
They also reminded that Assange sought and obtained the out of Sweden's case, that the comparison to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the Council of Stalin.
" This appears to be a fighter, not a legal persecution, denounced the missive.
While the world seeks - and Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be in an undisclosed location, but ignoring.
On Monday, he gave at an unknown location an interview to Time magazine across Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
" If we can show that it has been responsible for ordering American graduates that they spying in the United Nations in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign ," said.
His opinion has been insulted yesterday by the press secretary to the White House, Robert Gibbs, who has described as " ridiculous and absurd " the resignation request.
" I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should look ," said to CNN.
Obama himself has a high responsibility for counter-terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent leakage.
test spokesman for President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators claimed these days.
Peter King, Congressman that from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the Department of State is exploring the possibility of incorporating Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations " to confiscate his funds and continue to anyone who provides contributions or assistance ."
More far went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has his statements after having said that Assange will have to be murdered.
" Obama should turn it into a goal and use an air crew or something similar.
A person who has not requested apology has been Mike Huckabee, Minister Baptist, ex-gouverneur of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
" Anyone who is in the Government, which has filtered the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not a be a punishment too kind ," said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks the ERC peace with clins at followers of Carod
The Republican leader will enable the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic Executive and the rest of the system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the formula to resolve the umpteenth internal revolt of ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time, he knows that the influence of the sector is now so diluted that its liar and that it cannot give the headaches he had with other current extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra try win its new criticism with clins of eye that enable shield to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not in your hand.
If the carodistes want convey a vote of penalising the President, they can do without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks to avoid the image of division and that of submission to the person.
In several interviews he said that he would not ratified with more than half the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, as a result of the Bulgarian " is good.
people close to Carod require the president a little more than the position of voice, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós control the maxim body between the congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force the resignations, they will accept a roadmap with the executive until May.
, hope to participate in the development of strategic shift that the leadership to the voting National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of the plate to schedule the Congress in the fall of 2011, what the leaders see as a course.
The leader of ERC confessed that the " chorus of many " affects the stability and that its objective is to once and for all, the organization is able to wash your laundry room in the family.
In this line, that the current adviser Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader is ratified " in exchange for various objectives " it is as if was.
And it has listed five, he stresses two.
The first, " mend " the Executive it represents at least 90% of voice, i.e., include new figures from the sector supporter of Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid to once and for all the assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it supports reform of statutes that allows the achievement of congress in delegates elected by suffrage.
To finish with the model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession with the team Puigcercós, who fought already in the last two.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 has on the direction of revising the assembly in a specific reform of statutes.
The meeting remains unfinished, because the tide of recent years did not recommend address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time may be right for the resume and closed forever.

His short message maintains a cyber link with a more comprehensive document which the public is asked to contact immediately senators, because the legislation is imminent.
" with a vote which is expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice ," said.
The message was released after 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of all legislation if the extension of tax cuts from the time of Bush and the financing of government continue.
Such an impasse, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

The Democrats, the majority of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote in against and only a Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for this reason that the supporters of the Dream Act require several Republicans vote if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among Republicans more courted the Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux, Florida, which has supplemented the mandate to Senator Mel Martinez.

With the literature is the nail on the head
The second stage of Plaisirs language has been a walk in which participants flaunted the storytelling
" Sex in the language, I understand that, but. .. the nail on the head? hope for me? ', asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited open the second stage of Plaisirs language, a cycle that famous literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for another Fair table has been dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained Does).
The nail on the head ." .. we are in a quandary " launched slowly the Argentine writer, most young people, who had gathered at the Fair International Paper Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to the panel moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has a dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a player who seeks the wound, a doctor to another, without a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
In the infectiologue it convinced: " patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my head ."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologue which were cut off by the blast in the middle of the row, but explained that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyste that reveals the mystery: " the wound is what is reality, the symbolic is the scar.
player soupirât relieved and concludes: " on the wound I only have known that it is open and that it does not exist ," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very connected.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a beautiful storytelling entitled Éloge to the invention, where the nail on the head was not nombré but at a given time is discovered.
With overtones of magic realism, he spoke of a famous ensorceleuse affecting the clouds was returning people who had gone or repair virtues that a damoiselle had lost a narrative that transfers to talk then America, the great news that has been from the beginning its own columnists and Bernal quoted Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of the story of capitans conquerors.
" Cervantes which we invented all (the writers) mocking of false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre way would never have conté American history with an imagination missing even assault ."
, however, has pointed out, " the mad and the liars have the best imagination and by the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to a gang or another, where the literature of fiction peaked.
It is called the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
" It is thanks to his legacy is what we story ."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by invitation of the FIL with its panel The must on the wound.
The Cubaine-portoricaine is the scourge of the social violence that his country is - and Latin America shares, disputes the trafique and sale of drugs.
" I think good literature, the good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment is not, of course, premeditated ," said, after just the reality of literature is the communication and the size of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a " chemical reaction " of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who has stressed " must on the head of the writer engaged ."
has seen that in a world living in high speed also with regard to the intellectual habits and the control of conscience which turns to the advantage of dogma, " behind each claim there is a small and behind each deny there is a small yes.
" To be masters of our own feelings and be the masters of the reality, we must qualify: and nuance means many times the nail on the head and upset the people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and nuance and disturb also powers who prefer a world in black and white ," has said, to recover the sense to write.
Romano in the hunt for his first
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in concluding it has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, there are two different styles which are, by their technicians, among them a marked contrast from the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the final, he had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not hit the mark and it is for that reason that this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina has finally take comfort with the medal sous-champion, it remained a step behind the winners and oddly with the same team he has played for concluding consecutive.
The strategist santiste reached his first final as entraineur in the Tournament of Opening 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 it happened in decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournament Commemoration 2010, against the Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, as his team made a match equal 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he obtained a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to obtain title and finally three of its players missed 11 metres and he suffered the leap at 4-3.
Rubén lost two final Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he is trying to ignore the curse to celebrate a title for the first time, although it says that the institution is more important.
" I want to be a champion, I do not want to break no statistics, it is for a club, not a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important, " commented on the helmsman when asked what its weak points in the final.
He remembers much of the final last, he said that he had learned a lot, " the single lesson we can draw is that until the arbitrator master whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate ."
knows that this series could be defined by penalties, concerned, because it places in its players: " It is ever to reach the round of penalties, trying to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have that we prepare the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of the title in our hands, but we escaped, it served as a lesson for the final and we hope that we have in this situation -là ."
Romano now has the opportunity to be a technician sous-champion and taste the glory for the first time under the titles.

It appears that spoke of a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, who lives in a ambient, thought too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsénique.
In any form, the creature uses the arsénique as a way of life and we think a similar life could exist on other planets that have not our atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologistes, whether they use the arsénique in their metabolism, proves that " there is another form of life, a second form of life, different to the one we know ."
The space agency will provide the true scope of discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
At the conference will participate géobiologie Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite Saturn -RRB - in the context of its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.

The illegal migration will continue without any problem
The Tories, who, according to the Government, should address the problem of vessels responsible for illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties reported Wednesday that they could not support.
" I strongly supported on the Charter. "
" I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet, " said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while surrounded by MPs after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the bill, which would own up to a year everyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the bloc of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that it could not support the bill, because it is the wrong target.
" We are against and it appears that all the opposition parties are against, then we shall see what the government will do, " said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected out of hand the criticism that his party is not tough enough for the illegal immigrants.
" The néo-démocrates agreed to take measures against the smuggling of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35 ," said Ms. Chow.
" We do not support the bill Conservative because the refugees and imprisons children for at least a year, " said Ms. Chow.
The Immigration Minister, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties of play in politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.
" Canadians say en masse to Members that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, criminal operations targeting Canada and address the country as a front garden. "
" They expect Canada take firm action ," responded the Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on the bill, which could lead the country to elections in its rejection.
A Conservative, however, has said the QMI that the government would seek a vote so that each Member who will oppose is due to its voters.
The new unit is not unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continues to call for the establishment of a committee of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not yesterday: Québec visited the Department of Investigation of New York on last January.
The metropolis has a unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet announced Tuesday has come as a surprise to many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council in Quebec, on 29 October, this has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It should not to make the critical péquiste in public security, Stéphane Bergeron, called the announcement " rabbit emerged from a hat " and " solution bricolée on the corner of a table.
The Minister Dutil had responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
" You are going to see the result when we will announce, simply to say. "
" It is aware of this problem -là. "
For President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
" More Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to set up the committee, the more people believe like you and me that he has something to hide, " says.
" The only way to have a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest ," said about him Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National Academy of Public Administration.
To break the impasse, it suggests to Quebec to give a mandate to the auditor to investigate the collusion and corruption.
" It must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor general, instalment.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a escouade Permanent is not the only project in boxes of government Charest.
Quebec would also in Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case was not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson, focuses on certain amendments relating to this matter.
At the Spring 2001, affecting the biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not suited 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Act gangsterism.

Dupont partially blamé
The radio broadcaster of Quebec Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setbacks before the Council of broadcasting standards (Central Commission) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians on his bad language in waves.
The Central Commission judge that he and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the information contained inaccurate on social assistance, negative Haitians and vulgar language which is not appropriate for broadcasts during the day.
The Council has also concluded that a debate on suicide, including the dissemination of two people who were killed themselves, have not violated codes on the radio.
The Central Commission had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.

450 million in contracts without bidding
Quebec Hydroelectric has given over-the-counter $450 million in contracts for engineering firms for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor has gained most important, the stewardship of the project, for a sum of $295 million without competitive bidding.
The consortium called Energy stewardship was formed in 2004 simultaneously in the choice of Quebec Hydroelectric to entrust the private sector its responsibility to manage this important project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy consortium managed were to pick up the lucrative contract without had a public tender.
For the Quebec, the use of consortia companies is a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and drive up the price.
" This is the new way to collusion and to competition. "
" In other words, people, instead of making it so secret, now are doing so called ," said yesterday the Member péquiste Sylvain Simard in press conference.
earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because it said see difficult to see how the public interest can be used in this way.
The minister of natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded by afternoon, denying strongly that there has been collusion in the contract.
" I am beginning to get my journey ," she where after complaining that the PQ had been " dishonest " and had " lacked rigour ."
It said that " this is the least of the things that the PQ apologizes.
The consortia formula is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a limited alliance in the time allowed two or more companies to consolidate their respective expertise to meet a tender for a complex project.
The project Eastmain contains a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The construction is under way and must take until 2012.
, however, the contract was awarded without competition terms; there were negotiations.
So, consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week The Duty, consortia in génie-conseil made the subject of an investigation in government.
A rapid overview of the register of Quebec allows count over 200 consortia, some of which are permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, back to a single entity, or Dessau.
For Energy consortium stewardship, the Minister Normandeau stressed that " the territory of James Bay was dynamic of labour and that Quebec Hydroelectric does so special since the 1970s.
The leader of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Society of energy James Bay (SEBJ -RRB - provided an explanation which has been hair on the fact that the concession contract was given over-the-counter.
" You in bidding and that there are few bidders, prices will be higher. "
" You have two choices: either you have the people who are in the market -là and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price. "
" but the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the responsibility of the people, " said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium managed Energy is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec.
The contracts have been awarded by Quebec Hydroelectric or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After The Duty were 109 contracts génie-conseil agreed between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, including laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has been rounded up 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, excluding its participation in Energy stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They account for 449 783 $344, including the Energy contract management 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor) are well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.
The Minister Normandeau left to the PQ is also linked to these companies that the " finance ," before that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The label " green " does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer very little trust in sustainable development community, but also fair marks and certifications écologisantes to guide its choice.
Worse, even if he basks in a media world where messages in favour of a more responsible abound, it is a lack of credible information, as even in its commitment, said the Barometer responsible consumption, the first of which was delivered yesterday.
Even if they increase the consumption of products known as socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers appear to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell.
Two thirds of them say indeed believe the environmental commitment to business as the Green of companies, reveals the tool developed by the responsible consumption of the University Sherbrooke.
It half of consumers questioned the reliability of the official qualifications on the so-called fair, but also the credibility of products and brands being as being écoresponsables, said the Barometer.
In the same vein, the words of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
The information responsible consumption appears essential to stimulate this part of the lively consumption by almost one third of the Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient restrain 46 per cent of consumers.
That is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of people say they are also suspicious performance alleged green products or services that are trying to put in the hands.
On another note, consumers have been nearly half in 2010 has changed their habit and especially changed brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61% , they have also promoted purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and privileged food grown in their region, said the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint with the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological conscience appears to remain outside his car, said the Barometer: in 2010, only 28 percent of people reported having used the transport or the carpooling to defend their interests.
The walking and cycling has also been supported by 39.1% of participants in the survey behavioral has its first cliché.
A loan from the State for the purchase of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who were asked to make financial commitments in the takeover of cinema complex eXcentris by Angus and the Parallèle, agree to cooperate, but up to a loan only.
The Development Company Angus and the Parallèle, who hoped a donation of $7 million of the Ministry of Culture to buy at Daniel Langlois the film eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Lawrence in reinstating its full role cinéphilique, do not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan in the amount would be lower than expectations, which could be a viable solution to soft, at least to the sources from shops of the State.
A first action plan and a 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec in the spring, but the petitions have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan has been sent to the minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society of business development cultural (SODEC -RRB - François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris.
It provided a final report about 10 days ago.
But the counterproposal cabinet came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the donation of the State should really be waived.
recalled that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinéparcs of Quebec objected to a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance housing projects, which it had not been for other cinemas.
But several community calling for a substantial economic assistance.

The veil lifted on Canada complexé. ..
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but they betray the feeling of superiority of them to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats that every Canadian voter has the relationship canado-américaines in voting and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to get its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, including the public place yesterday, provide more details croustillants that the substantial content to eat.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in full federal election campaign, recounted how the United States is not among the issues discussed by political leaders.
amazement to the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offer some explanations for this situation.
" A inferiority complex Canadian almost inherent is perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic challenges of everyday life rather than make this election in the United States (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade) ," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, it concludes, " the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk.
Ambassador understand this " deafening silence " that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
" Logically, he believes, the capacity of a candidate of a party and even more a party leader to manage this vital relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting. "
The expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent the 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d 'affaires in Ottawa, preparing for President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
" Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence beginning February on the federal budget, by which Canada posting its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars ," Mr Breese.
nowhere is it mentioned that the Government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report, dated January 2008 and signed the ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC refer the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, No-Fly-List " or kidnapping for interrogation from the CIA.
A cable states that, in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some of the prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of " case by case ."
At the end of the meeting, written, " submitted a paper to the Secretary of State of Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian. "
" The secretary has agreed to review the case.
Note that minds are running high on the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser to Stephen Harper, has said on the CBC that the head of this mass flight should be " killed ."
It was echoed by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday to Cancún a renovation plan of the domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries for a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which represents almost one third of the additional needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
The ambitious plan lies in the wake of major projects that the United Nations hopes in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
Under the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs to monopolize still 50 to 70 per cent of the market were replaced by bulbs fluocompactes or, better, by light bulbs light-emitting diode (LED or LED in English -RRB - the bulk of 1.8 billion tons (GT) of GHG issued on the planet to enlighten people be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
That is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of cars.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should increase aggregate GHG emissions of 53 gigatonnes by 49 gigatonnes.
But it from this assessment yet 5 Gt in order to stabilize by 2020 the rise of climate change to 2 degrees Celsius to avoid becoming out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is in the form of heat and the remaining 5% , of the light.
With bulbs fluocompactes, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs LED, reduces the energy of two again.
The bulbs fluocompactes lasting an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new bulbs LED, such as those that launched the manufacturing Philips this week - the company participated in the study - have a life expectancy of 25 000 and consume 80 percent less energy than a bulb smouldering fuse, which gives an idea of the economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
The new bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to making very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have posted reservations against bulbs fluocompactes because they contain mercury and that we must eliminate as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturing establish instructions.
, however, said the report, the main source of emissions of mercury on the planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in the incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would thanks to this programme.
For example, Indonesia sparing a billion dollars a year into electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 plants whose construction cost 2.5 billion.
The Côte d 'Ivoire in the nervousness the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has claimed the publication " without delay " the results of the presidential election in Côte d 'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadline.
" The secretary general stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce interim results without delay, said a spokesperson for the head of the United Nations. "
" It calls on all parties and institutions to act responsibly and refrain from any action until the announcement of preliminary results. "
Despite pressure from foreign governments, the Electoral Commission has missed the deadline Wednesday midnight without publishing the results three days after the ballot Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the chairman of the IEC had said on television that the continued to work " to announce the results.
appeals have multiplied in the world for the CIS finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of fraudulent votes in the north, held by the former rebels of New Forces (FN) since the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, campaign manager of the President, said that the intimidation of voters by the National Front in the north of the country had dissuaded the supporters of the outgoing president to vote.
Any election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are selected by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the North denies any link with the former rebels, considered " unacceptable ," the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo respect, but it is not gone so far as to claim the victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of results because he knows that he has lost and bring a case before the Constitutional Council, after prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential Sunday, was supposed to top the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the vote, compared with 32% to Alassane Ouattara, which has received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bedie (25% in the first round).

Case Clotilde Reiss: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months of July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran on spying, the opinion in France, diplomacy, and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
The everything under the watchful eyes of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace has explained his strategy to the Americans, their advice for the treatment of their own crises of hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been counterpart to the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the American justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place in a harsh light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
diplomatic cable drafted the 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled " Iran: French comments on how to deal with cases of hostages ."
The adviser of the Elysée Palace to the strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d 'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to repatriate their own nationals detained in Iran.
" noise ," they say, " martelez ever " in the media " human rights ," " innocence ," " immediate release.
It is to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
" Do it all the more that the Iranians you request not to do so ."
For past attempts to discussions channels, " the silence will not solve nothing ," the Iranians are " masters in delaying tactics ."
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is " an Iranian tactic familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail ."
announced that the release from jail of Clotilde Reiss (who will speak on 16 August, when it takes refuge in the French Embassy) " will require the payment to the Iranians for a large sum of money " (230 000 bond).
And it said that the Elysée Palace anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which " will worsen ."
Iranians could " in the near future arrest another some 1,800 people living in Iran ," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for 12 days, but remained blocked in Iran.
A information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose US demand the extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as many observers wondered about this disturbing coincidence.
In Washington, clamping down on the illegal networks Iranian acquisition of equipment for the nuclear programme, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has agreed a deal?
The release of the Iranian, against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, has not only been completely taken by surprise by the decision of the judge, but has sought to oppose it.
" There have been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the Attorney-General " (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie -RRB - but the French Government cannot revisit the decision " judicial, does it.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the " close monitoring of French intelligence.
The adviser of the Elysée Palace composed a telephone number, links, and then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian " is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée Palace is sparing no effort, through communicated and " leakage " in the media, to give the impression that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a role " important " and " influential " of Ombudsman.
Americans are watching this activity without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several press reflected the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the 'blitz' media official French ."
On the basis of gratitude expressed to Mr Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
" Despite their speeches full of praise, the French officials admit in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have really done ."
The document then looks at the reasons which led the Elysée Palace to make in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication aims to validate the policy of Sarkozy opening to Syria, analysis.
A launched in 2008, which " was seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and imméritée ."
In " exaggerating the Syrian role, Paris seeks to " demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract playing a constructive role in the region ."
The aim is also to " sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.
The US embassy knows of good source.
The 11 August, François Richier entrusted to it: " Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything. "
" But we thank you. "
" This should at least confusion among Iranians. "
Clotilde Reiss is in France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy takes to the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their " active role for the release of our compatriot.
No online games for the young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a " Cinderella " that will prohibit adolescents to play games online after midnight to block their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives from the ministries of culture and the family.
" Many children play in these games all night and then learning difficulties at school and have a normal life during the day. "
" We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep ," told the AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial responsibility for the bill.
The online games will again be available to 6 a.m.
companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games for young people whose parents request, added the responsible.
It will also be available to people who are calling for free software which limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the more " connected " and the newspapers reported regularly events related to extensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global competitions of online gambling.
In November, the South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, to 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: the Fifa means the organizers
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa means Thursday, the organizers of World Cups 2018 and 2022, a highly political battles and lobbying may take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 competition Queen of the Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of discipline (4: England, Russia, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, hoping to win new territories (Qatar, Australia -RRB - after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its settlement with the US and Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of leading delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Heads of Government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is a measure of economic and political challenges of a World.
The negotiations behind the scenes may last up to the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of the Fifa, English, 2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations will count for very heavy for 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu -RRB - could have undermined the chances of his country, home of football which has hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC has submitted a Monday, making a documentary which identifies three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What is upsetting the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who are engaged in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The Government hope repeat the coup managed by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won in 2005 to London the organization of JO-2012.
This activity is enough to restore the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Espagne-Portugal does not lack of assets with its stages already ready, his expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could showering their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are increasing the symbol of Russia, become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of his case (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced a " unfair competition in the preparations for the vote, " in a thinly veiled reference to the English press charges against members of the EC.
" It covers of mud, trying to compromise " launched Mr. Putin.
In 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, are seen as the favourite.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which built separately a wonderful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries worked the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of Mondial-2026 to China, eagerly welcomed by the Fifa, which would make lapse Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, who broke the game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries are more likely than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from weak TV rights fulfilled (because of the time difference) by European countries, the lifeblood of the war for the Fifa.
Second: clearly
De Gaulle really had hesitated.
Mitterrand said he was reluctant.
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate to the Elysée Palace is another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But clearly does not with mystery attached to the presidential office.
So it must act as if the doubt still exists.
In a sense.
In 2006, even without trust, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy to take its decision " somewhere in the autumn of 2011.
What he referred to in front of UMP, on Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of two mandates " has caused a bit of volatility.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was not.
The President was recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year terms.
It was an observation, not a announcement.
This is not the first time that presidential, humour, at such meetings.
" At worst, or at best, you have yet to seven and a half years with me ," launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: ' Do not believe that I am not in the next stage. "
statement on Monday makes it not more candidate that; they are no less.
If they raise comments, on a double reason.
The acceleration of the nomination race at PS.
but it is not the emergence of Ségolène Royal pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to come forward.
That is because its candidate in 2012 is clear that much at PS call for an order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% compared to 44% , according to BVA-L'Express).
" We have a candidate and there is no discussion of the UMP this " immediately and carefully reacted Premier.
" If it believes the defeat, it will not candidate, Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
" It would always be profits, corrected Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the exit of crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of operations unconventional monetary policy which must be achèver at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis, the institute of Frankfurt may not allow itself to be sweeping under penalty of worsen a situation more tense today on the European bond markets.
The cost would be higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of states in Europe.
She did not want to say whether they believed that the central bank should do more, increasing by example its programme of buying sovereign bond.
" I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...) ."
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown more reticent to its intentions, simply stating that the programme of buying securities State on the secondary market continues " and that " we will see what we decide " at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB is going to keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent, the lowest level on record since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of government bonds by the ECB have doubled last week, about 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish titles and Portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem purchased for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, the expectations of further purchases are clear (see page 29).
Economists either do not expect significant change of course.
operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the Commission still unlimited cash benefits according to generous conditions and for periods from a week to three months.
Economists are now expecting this device will be extended by a few months.
" I cannot imagine that it changes significantly its programme. "
" Otherwise it would take the risk of new tensions in the short term, said Michael Schubert, economist Commerzbank.
" progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely, anticipates its side Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On its interventions on the public debt market, " the ECB should maintain a volume of these obligations to lead a sluggish market, said Norbert Bräms.
In view of the importance of European banks to markets exhibitions of sovereign debts of the euro zone, the Institute of issuance has no other choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
" It must at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a soaring returns paid by the most fragile states ," an important bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates are high, the States will be more constrained to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
The Protection of the euro is the price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi Government made the round back
After an earlier this week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little relaxed yesterday, with the return of bond rate in 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the presidents region reported hearing Giulio Tremonti describe the situation " indecipherable nature " and expect a weekend " unpredictable ," that the person has subsequently denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the German gap with the long rate had reached the peak of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing a panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has pointed out that in Spain, the German gap with the rate was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was " deeply concerned " by the market turmoil and a possible spillover from Ireland.
" The good news is that Italy, third economy of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland. "
" The bad news is that it is as Portugal ," said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, his problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenue that goes with, making the state the risk of no longer being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the Government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012. .. while the budget under consideration in the Senate panel on respectively 1.3% and 2% .
In these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will still 4.3% of GDP next year, compared with 3.9 per cent forecast by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumour of a new collective budget could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
" If necessary, further austerity measures will be taken ," according to the Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
" The fundamentals of the economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat long has Karl Sadun, the Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in Italy at the IMF.
" There is no problem in the immediate, or the short or the long term, because despite its substantial debt (represented per cent of GDP in 2011, NDLR -RRB - requested stabilization efforts in Italy are lower than those proposed in other countries, " said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.

The 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi faces up to a motion of censure at the Chamber of Deputies, followed by elections could be held in late March.
With would open a period that decision-making in cases of serious crisis.

Christine Lagarde has been reaffirmed yesterday in a Paris press conference: " The Europeans, I believe that it has even shown Sunday in the day and the night are obviously solidarity, determined, pledged to defend their currencies and their monetary zone. "
Although relative, registered yesterday on the European level of government bonds provided grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot talk of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard& Poor's announced that they would degrade the debt of Portugal, the target most referred today by speculation.
" As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political profile, which weighs including banking systems ," believe economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Moreover that " the time is much slower than the time markets ."
aware of this gap and dangers, the European countries to intensify discussions to enhance the already existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers of the G20.
And this in view also of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.

Metro Grand Paris: first outlines financial
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in the Ile de France is in full swing, the billion rained down.
In the discussion.
It referred in particular to 23 billion for the subway Grand Paris that must build the Grand Paris.
To start the GSP, the state has announced a capital funding of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical framework, it is this which will then the GSP to borrow on the market share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, it is the first additions.
The budget-conscious 2010, discussed in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax plan and an increase in the tax offices in the Ile de France.
The first, do we read in the text of the draft law, 15, is " for the benefit of the public Society of Greater Paris.
It is said: " The proceeds of this tax is EUR 117 million a year ."
The second is a modification of a tax offices that already exists to modernise, increase the product and the increase in the Grand Paris.
That would do it?
there are no grounds for.
This is not specified in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
" It is said that the fiscal resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of equity funding which will be mobilised by the state and made to the Grand Paris as project ," in the explanatory statement.
A GSP, the system is not shocking.
" Once we created revenue (the two taxes, ndlr -RRB - could cover the studies on three years later bash in the 4 billion later, explains. "
" It will be entered in the budget and fired as ."
The GSP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This, in which the 4 billion promised are still on hold, may cause a parliamentary debate a little troubled.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers vengeful and diligence spies
The case WikiLeaks has a dual value.
On the one hand, it is a scandal, a scandal that is as scandal before the hypocrisy which governs relations between the Member States, citizens and the media.
On the other hand, it changes at international level, and suggests a future dominated by the regression.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each file by secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuttings.
" extraordinary " American revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only on what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns -RRB - and the profile eerily caricature of Gaddafi was a cabaret artists substance to skit.
The rule that the secret files should be compounds that new already known is essential to the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a bookshop of esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeat (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, followed or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was written in the previous books.
And not only because the author of hidden texts do not like the novel (or knows where to seek new on the non-existent -RRB - but because those involved in the occultisme believe what they already know, and reconfirms that they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit), the head of the secret service (otherwise, it might be, that I do not know, editor of Liberation -RRB - which is as true as this.
The top secret on Berlusconi information that the US embassy in Rome was sending to the Department of State were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these cases have made much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any person cultivated already know, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of States can telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few small exercises, turned into centres of espionage.
Any spectator film investigative knows very well that, and this is hypocrisy that one pretending to ignore.
However, repeat publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and put in a bad light American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that a hacker any can capture the secret more secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal does it not in crisis the victims and the perpetrators.
But the profound nature of what happened.
past, time of Orwell, could all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely been since, that can monitor each movement through telephone calls, each transaction, the hotel visited the motorway taken and the citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when, as now, that even the cryptes secrets of power cannot escape the clutches of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be unidirectional and is circular.
The power control each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as vindictive citizen - can hear all the secrets of power.
How can a power which has the possibility to maintain its own secret can be taken?
It is true, Georg Simmel the true secret is a secret (and secret vacuum can never be unveiled); it is true, too, that knowing everything about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret empty secret, because public; but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that the secret of Hillary Clinton were secret empty means it.
WikiLeaks has made no mistake to Sarkozy and Merkel, but has done too large to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that, in the future, states can no longer put online any privileged information - that would be to publish it on a poster on the street corner.
but it is equally clear that with the current technology, it is futile to hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state has shifted in aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future the private reports and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials moving quietly in effort to uncontrollable routes, had been carrying messages learnt by heart or, at most, in hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copy in drawers locked: basically, the attempt to espionage Watergate had less success that WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that the technology is now in crabe, i.e. backwards.
A century after the Telegraph has revolutionized communications, Internet re-established a telegram on son (telephone).
cassettes (analogue) had made it possible for researchers in cinema to explore a film, going forward and back and see all the secrets of mounting, whereas now the CD (digital) can jump of chapter by chapter, i.e. macroportions.
With high-speed trains will be from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas in aircraft, and that it includes requires three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary that the political and communications in the cars.
One last comment.
the past, the press was trying to understand what went in the secret of embassies.
A far embassies that are confidential information to the press.
Weather: how France bidouille its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the promises of funding disbursed (so-called funding fast start or early) made by the developed countries.
And the big bidouillages French proved.
In the Copenhagen agreement, the developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion (€ 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has lifted the great game to persuade its partners in the reality of his commitment to funding fast start: report detailing its Member States press conference, great side event, distributing pamphlets. ..
The operation transparency is important and valued: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU have emerged in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on the way to its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
That money should be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, " new and additional " to ensure that an extra effort is made without being at the expense of ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what " new and additional ."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some Member States, including France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits.
The European Commission has, for example, be considered reference year 2009: international funding are maintained, and it would add 150 million three-year funding fast start.
Other countries have similar references in terms of year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France believes that the funding of all new projects of the year 2010 are " new and additional ."
In other words, there is no reference to the previous years or at the global level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total support of France to developing countries can remain stable (or even reduce -RRB - it claims to respect its commitment to funding new and additional ." ..
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ paid amounts to 1€.
Of course, it is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies -RRB - it is a fallacy to submit a euro will recover as equivalent to a euro that. .. They should be counted under its commitments that the cost of the loan to the lender (the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has to do with such reasoning: " respects " its commitment of 420 million euros in 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use if massive loan.
Germany is required to 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is 1€ to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Joli sleight of hand.
In summary, in its financing fast start, France is a double fraud: on the action and the reality of the financial effort.
In spending that 36.1 million euros, it believe it spends 420 million new and additional " consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it is Bercy arbitration has done) could have a double negative impact, both in the EU (why the other Member States continue to give whether it is sufficient to pay?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled. ..
Chapter of early funding is only a small matter on short term, compared to the discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the vast machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of funding early.
First, France could announce a change in its policy for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could move the discussion on the issues of long-term financing (other crucial chapter currently being discussed: it will not escape the question of " additionality " or policy loans.
France could change its position to become progressive on these issues it is on others.
The hope is based on the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and on its vision of additionality and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary for progress in the discussions.
Alert pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child interfering in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday of the association Générations Futures (former Movement for Rights and respect for future generations).
The association, warned that its results were not significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples, but are illustrative of the issue addressed ," has purchased between July and September foods usually consumed in four meals and a encas in a day by a child of 10 years, in the Oise supermarkets and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day, and sweets, were considered by research laboratories of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The base is damning: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogens some and 37 substances that act as endocrine disruptors (PE -RRB - according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
" Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our survey that the reality of the exposure of consumers to possibly carcinogenic contaminants and/or EP is worrying ," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain alone more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as carcinogenic some and nearly 20 residue that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as encas by the study, present traces of six chemicals including a fungicide yet banned in France.
Even to the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful banned in the EU.
In addition, the burgers, the canned tuna, and even the wand of bread and the chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the " rich " with 34 chemical residues detected and even the base in plastic used to warm the food at the microwave was not free.
The final risk to consumers ' cocktails of contaminants " is probably underestimated ," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie The Greens (EE-LV -RRB, for its part, has proposed " faced with the urgency of the situation " a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop " the increase in diseases of civilisation ."
In July, a study of the European agency for food safety (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereals.
