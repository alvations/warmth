Lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owner
Scneelose runways are not only the giant mountains in the vicinity.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and guest houses.
So you can get in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to.
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "to see," will be led by the operators of the information portal spindl. info, Martin jandura.
Who the New Year's Eve - stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, no longer wants to be with the appointment of hesitation.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer - for the New Year's Eve day mostly just weeks residence.
I think that they will seek to sell them, but then they must also give in, and for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will be quickly, estimated estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always a travel agent in Ingtours Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents ingtours, Petr schiefert.
The New year's day in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi travel agent, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by the fact that in Giant always no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes within a week of snow, will also be sold off the Christmas Schiefert, says.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, manages to fill the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New year's Day and Christmas, we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in the janua, and in February, the business as well, the director of the best hotels Pec, Karel rada.
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also filled the Omnia Hotel in Central Park Square in Janske Lazne.
However, remains at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we are currently at around 60 percent.
A bit weaker is now the february, but at the moment, when the snow comes, is also the interest in the placements in giant, the director of the hotels omnia, Erik sporysch.
On a snow Mess waiting for the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it was cool and if it rains, the snow on the mountains.
But then again, a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec kralove.
United states: repetition is the mother of the wisdom of
It is almost comical, with which Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the afghanistan issue, which he considered himself for the dümmsten.
When he finally his gaze longingly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it emerged that he is on the Kopierpapier from the Bush Iraq scenario for three years ago.
Not only that, several times in the text itself, the phrase "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new way forward", used without hesitation.
He has three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq to send - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military lands that the only possible and has been very successful in that it is now in the news about iraq no longer.
The Bush's reputation has not improved, because he has an objective to his successor a much dankbarere starting position behind, as it was to be expected.
In afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent of troops have asked him again the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the subordination protecting habits the vacillating harshly criticized in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but no better idea, and he has betrayed the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From europe, he has the promise for a further 5,000, even if he was at least 10,000.
Highly problematic for The Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine has left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders pay tribute to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - you can rely on second and there are no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correct, remain just a veneer of buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions of the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "viable state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated further, and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cry about "the homecoming" broke out, create a miracle, can only a truly romantic soul who are not the facts.
From the political point of view, it is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians and their constituents want not explain how the security of Germany or Italy, with the war in the Hindu Kush mountain's country.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only sop for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election, and, therefore, there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls this would prove a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no bonuses in cash bonuses
The chief executives of the us bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year more in cash.
The company announced that it has responded to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but we can only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares the managers in the case, if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is in accordance with the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium of Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs, the target of criticism after it for the first three quarters of this year, nearly 17 billion dollars set aside for premium bonuses.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses during the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today, despite the measure likely exceed $20 billion.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to exceed the bonuses of bankers, the 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning, the Finance minister, Eduard Janota, considering his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form in which has been released by the Assembly on wednesday, disagrees.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting will be.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On another wants to remain in his post on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget bill, which is now Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals for money, and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal Party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic dispute, transformed the question mark over the future work of the fishermen officials cabinet, on which of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by parliament, the package of austerity measures, the fish 'government in the autumn, and that the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have been neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still rely on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ods chairman Mirek topolanek, said that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr necas, said the CTK that the concept of cabinet officials, with the support of the cssd, ODS and Green party seems no longer works.
Prime minister Fischer described in the editorial similar words as "strong worry."
The CSSD leader, Jiri paroubek, responded to the Topolanek said that the budget deficit is terrible that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday rated the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "invictus: the ungeschlagene" of the world shows that much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson mandela, is in his life history of the American oscar actor Morgan freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood- film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "if I play, I must take.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the East Wood drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby", was the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from the finish has become the slave owners, a fictional us president, and also in "evan Allmächtig", but only rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, it is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film recounts a true story, The Nelson Mandela his forces with The captain of The South African rugby team, Francois pienaar, leading to some of The country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically divided.
He believes that he can agree people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders in the world.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years, the Mandela history at the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role, this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he.
The actor said, if he and the world would be in the same country, he would try to meet with mandela to eat with him and, in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake hands.
I have noticed that when I say schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important to me to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the world rugby.
It was a great surprise for him, as he met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door bell that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: 'in the film, I see a lot more'.
Despite the apparent differences in the stature of the actor in comparison with their actual role models, he has headed by director East Wood" Invictus: ungeschlagen "received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.

Light norway: The Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian defense ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch was not successful and the type of "bulava" rocket, which was originally the pride of the Russian army should be, will slowly into a nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime minister, Vladimir putin.
His repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or were damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers about "bulava" than a "missile, which is not flies."
A missile, which flies, but
This 13th attempt came at the beginning of normal.
Until the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the rocket.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This allows for the type of rocket firing from the submarine.
It is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified fliegendes object on Northern ways the damaged "bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals, diesesmal challenged and claims that it is not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell affected by the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without error, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence, only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
Almost 50 per cent of the success that the generals met with optimism and so will continue to claim that the "Bulava" even without problems, and even fly to ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.

Fetisov, who finished his career with forty years ago, in 1998, is the current President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency quoted AP the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player is only a game.
I believe that this is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, players nemcinov.

We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on saturday, 19 december, proposed voluntary overtime for the reason that two working groups would be used, said vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company would have the staff that the Saturday shift work, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff also received for the class of 28 november.
According to the company has decided to change type of staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime pay or they can substitute for holidays on 28 December and extend the Christmas holidays, vanek.
In addition, all members of the Saturday section minibuses and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime the dearest and most burning issue with regard to the demands and complaints of trade unionists were suspended last week, the production had decided the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk led.
The staff of the automobile factory had been forced to work until last week, practically every day after the Achtstundenschicht 2 hours.
After signing the agreement, the strike will revoke willingness on the part of the trade unions.

Until this September here around 80,000 vehicles, the current manufacturing capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: A substance, which also works with Dell gestählt Dell HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the drawback is that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
But their income will be accompanied by a series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus, also has the sg development. resistentviren, against the medicines are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences cr, from the VSCHT (chemisch technological University) prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how we can deal with resistance to the virus.
They have shown that the substances on the protein known as Metalokarborane, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new "enhanced" compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor -, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and virus - resistant
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV virus caused by the HIV virus division would not Infektionsvirenpartikel mature.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients from, say the scientists in the press report, published by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences cr.
In the work in the Science paper was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the researchers describe a series of compounds, in which two couples of the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then continues systematically.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested, including their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective drugs against HIV research, says Pavlina rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute.
Dispute over budget. ODS went on fishermen are opposed to the lottery
The chairman of the ods, Mirek topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ods described the Prime minister as a "strong worry."
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy chairman, Petr necas, said that the concept of cabinet officials with the support of the cssd, ODS and Green party, does not appear.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be staying in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, pointed out.
Parliament has approved on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party has on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget provisional frase not clear.
Frustration and futility.
The Finance Minister, Eduard janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
In accordance with the Czech television has registered on Monday after the government business in the premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
This is his disappointment at the Verhandugn of the budget.
The extent to which fishermen for the fight with the Budget-Defizit, have, in accordance with the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do with that.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts deficit will enhance laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the service law should be changed.
Topolanek: The ODS is not nominated ministers
That is a matter for the Prime minister, fishermen and the government.
The ODS nominated ministers have made no mistake, Topolanek said in a text message from the United states.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function, who are trying to commit TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decided to abandon the fight against the level of deficit in public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament".
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of the people can count on Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said the citizens of the Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak journalists in parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister.
Necas said at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats would explicitly ask that you allow the adoption of the budget.
We shall not orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not.
I have not noticed that my vote would be.
Even when I dropped to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positive, would react, Topolanek itself.
After the new map of the CD (czech railways) will be fewer trains for roughly the same fare.
The Czech railways closed or restricted from 13 December some less full speed and local trains, other ties will be strengthened against it.
The whole transport volume from the day of the new road map compared with today at two percent.
Most of the tariffs incl. Basic and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several link opportunities in the capital, for example, the inhabitants of the work area, the railway is of the type Pendolino trains.
The bike will no longer go Bratislava (former).
Less fast trains will also be on the route Prague - Pisek - budweis, in principle, the direct flights from Prague to letohrad.
The biggest reduction plans the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (King Graz), for a total of eight per cent, against a rise in Prague and surrounding areas can be pleased.
Be lifted two night trains on the line Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on some days in the week of the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct routes from Milovice after Prague, currently, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem switch.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The long-distance routes in the capital will end in the target station Prague - main railway station.
The CD is more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and ostrava and the trains after Sumperk / Jesenik will drive in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional rail: Increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of transport, overall, the railway to reimburse the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion kronor, as well as this year. Local trains take care of the districts, overall pay them in the next year, eight billion kronor, the state three billion indemnifying.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains has completed the railway a ten-year contract, until now, the Treaty was only for a year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it is the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Among changes, it is only in one-day Netzfahrscheinen CD and in favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska Net.
For passengers without the customer card will increase the price CD net of 450 kroner to 600.
The price eLiska will depend on the stecke, until now, he was for travel between any district towns and cost 160 kroner.

Jancura sues for libel proceedings against three head of the cssd.
The owner of the student agency, Radim jancura today, criminal proceedings for libel against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district olomouc, Martin.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions, but at the end of the long-term contracts signed with the Czech railways.
All three head and say that we take the cherries, we have made the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, which were completed last week.
So, we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the society student Agency, said Jancura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection for the continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura him as free advertising for his company, as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I urge other head on.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge.
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now voices reported that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken.
The Institute of Medicine sets the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination.
Vaccines for children free of charge for August
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not yet received.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccine in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be taken between 3 and 5 living month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses are needed.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities from 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state has spent on all land vaccination of children around 500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination programme was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen died in hospital after investigation per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine requirements?
At the same time, said that the vaccine could be in the future.
From January to be paid by the insurance and voluntarily.
Said that the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association nahlas, Rudolf kalovsky.
His association with the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the International Conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way that we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health but will not change the vaccine trial Pneumokokken.
At this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
The chairman of the society of practical kinderärzten, Hana cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the possibility of reducing the repetition of vaccination, "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine launched a voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents their infants against Pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is also speaking, the first to land vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project should the vaccines have been purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some Members were, however, that the insurance, "the money from the health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait for the insurance to pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and thoughtful report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe - and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the last station of the author: "why the French no scarves love" (original title: "don ’ t Like the French Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, the country for over a year and a half decades and are employed and its impact even today.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in france, but what is really happening in the area.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which is now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in france, as it calls "islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)?
Young Muslims should be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman can marry a Muslim man?
It is permissible for a Muslim, a banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik ramadan, a Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, questioned the bowen, are usually at odds with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia - which is a small but influential presence among europe's muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
He queries whether the French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees more of a tightening of the screws "as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The bleak outlook for the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other region in the world.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and life that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice"), a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
Au fait with the complex history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich sea, fought only with his rifle butt Muskete, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young, who were caught when they are behind the bodies of their mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the twentieth century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today Zooanlagen typically still have a million thirtieth of The living area of a wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: The Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of The algae that grow in The hollow hair of his skin.

Although banned in norway, America and russia, the Erlegen in Greenland and canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sleigh mobile Inuit powerful storm guns, to express their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of the two nations the ice longest remain.
In his new book "after the ice" (the original title "after the ice") offers Alun anderson, a former editor of the science magazine new scientist, "a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight as to how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.

But, starting with the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened, once the summer ice, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.

Marines were among the 6,000, laid wreaths at the Arlington
The Obergefreite De'Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to lay a wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other marines, the journey from Camp Johnson in Jackson ville, North carolina, the national cemetery in arlington, to decorate graves, was the day a tribute to the men and women, in their footsteps.
In a few months, from where we are returned, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we do, I would hope that someone would do the same for me, so I am trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday mornings to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.

It is as if the visit of a family tomb.
Wrapped in areas best clothes of the volunteers across the vast grass land and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as an objective, since they are not as often as the newer graves visited the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while the fresh pine branches to the grey grave stones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, was strapped to the upper part.
The Section 60, which is located in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service organizations cheered 1,000 wreaths, this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars in this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names in stone, while others to small black and white place cards, which had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet ready.

The U. S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities.
The Cuban government has a contractor for the us government, mobile phones and Notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on saturday.
The contractor, has not yet been identified, working for Development Alternatives genetics, inc., with headquarters in bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the charge of "threat" can be arrested.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include an easy protests and critical writings, carries a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements will be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first proposed by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and note Books in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government employees $15 per month.
The Cuban government allowed only since this year, ordinary citizens, the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be for the sending of text messages, since a 15 - a telephone call would cost.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government departments, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect their names often the government.
Too many Web access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison, sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, press spokesman for the US representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that is legal in any other free society - the tax free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights watch, "which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title" new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as leader of the country, the ailing older brother fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that would probably be any solution politically, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United states, just at the time when both countries for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistan authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill us soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they obscure insurgents, known as saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to pakistan, after he had been found, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan, the leader of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the Al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and still tried to get the right advice to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists, and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US secret service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters as guardians of the organization, not letting those whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those who might be spies.
American al Qaeda will be tried by a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to U.S. goals and its propaganda value, but they are also viewed as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years has also become much more cautious in regard to whom to allow access, because the US intelligence experts are their recruitment methods.
If you try to anyone in these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model, which so many have followed?, said Kohl man.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate Action ".
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella conference centre in the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the city.
On a day when the promoted by the un climate talks little happened, thousands of activists carrying banners in english, "through the city, on which there is no Planet b" and one in spanish, the declared "earth says' enough '.
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena christensen, who said that the trips to peru, the country of their birth mother, her face with the heart-breaking problems the country on the basis of the already significant effects of climate change.
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to take part in the mass demonstration - pass to the floor and appeal to the world leaders, a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way more.
The police, the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either hooded or pocket pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned.
A viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the negotiations on climate change, setting dressed in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main canal, near where several ministries.
They threw them in the vicinity of the buildings, he said, and added that it was, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the conference centre, the people on television screens throughout the afternoon, the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration had a positive effect on the international considerations, he replied in english: "that is something that I was unbelievable."
He then drove in Mandarin and said: "Because the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He said that from the perspective of the individual is on whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The evidence on the mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington still far behind the schools of the country, the maximum benefits, the records show that the Viert and Achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - naep) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white pupils, both at local and National level.
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington, D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), the African-American peer groups, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the achievement gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture over a six year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the item number, the children of both groups have grown in that time span, has reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the southern last week expressed their concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in Washington D.C..
I will not for a span of two or three points and down, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course we would like to see the positive signs, which I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we are nowhere near the time and energy that we need to stand up for our middle school.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum that Wilson reading system to use aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their classes comrades.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to class for the sixth games and lebensechte experience in the foreground, under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP progress, were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils benefit from the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to provide the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit examined.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions, working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as in other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the city neighborhoods, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is in washington, the traditional public school year, which at 180 days to extend, in order to compete with charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a larger increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than prospects
The coach, the Gettysburg College with a loud pipes.
Graciela rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have just completed the High School in El salvador.
Until recently, had also Graciela in silver Spring has been recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Your attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, the cost was a ehrfurchtsvollen visitors, rather than an enthusiastic prospective students.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said, as the low Professor to student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, which visited the children on their three-day tour and now they have included the intended message altogether: The question is not whether it's going to College.
The question.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants do not end the High School or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of the college education is needed to aufzu in the middle class.
In truth is one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the College - which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents are immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Central america, completed in the United states, without the High school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the workforce of the country, show the way forward.
Those who study high-achieving children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and a powered to success.
Many of them have parents who send their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to come in college, especially if these efforts over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, it will be a single measure at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia gándara, a researcher at the University of California at davis, the hispanoamerikanische students.
We have to think about it, a support network for these children from kindergarten to the High school to provide.
The federal program, sponsored Gracielas College tour, is a useful example.
It is known as Gear up - a play - and more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college preparation programs to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the High school.
According to the us Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can lead to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that china, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only shares in two of the 10 auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for versteigerte fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of us companies, Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba husari, the editor of Iraq Oil forum, an online news service.
There will be no further bids in Iraq.
Security concerns by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably prevented, analysts said to get more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
Us firms were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies have been able to conclude contracts with the ministry.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which stood with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has called for more contracts, than any other companies with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big countries of the world economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern measure and fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the requirement to vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to address each Felds to increase beyond the current level.

Eide redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 us troops to afghanistan.
The un envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the us timetable for the military withdrawal, which will start in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political transition in afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.

He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-general Ban ki moon now, so that he had time for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, according to UN officials with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish - Italy - descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean - Marie Guéhenno, the previous UN peacekeeping operations has taken into account.
Oath draws position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to favor President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of galbraith, who was fired, "the mission have undoubtedly, because it is already a great deal of scepticism in relation to the international interference in the election".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the American-led forces in afghanistan.
He also urged that the un leadership of his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The un rules are designed so that I since may, he said, only one person.
This is disastrous and should not continue.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he is not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from iraq, the war own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and" is necessary, "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons," because "their people" will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White house, Robert gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences, if its nuclear programme is not to the demands of the un Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and a substantial part of its stores stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed would forgo nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran, however, since this time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to commit to the United States.
Iran, the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had already agreed in early october, simply left, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and chinese, brought together in a way, as it in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran have never, Gates said.
President Obama has the 31st Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue to follow.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday, "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of some Security Council members called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who should return last Friday to Washington, met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers with Kurdish authorities in Kirkuk and representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the us plans to reduce the American troops by the end of august from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought to use the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. US-Vertreter quoted Gates, Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will ensure their security, prosperity, and their autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave.
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them, that "mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "a baby means one more tomb".
These lessons they have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "in no case."
We already have all our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 - month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled individual children, who affectionately called "little emperors", has produced a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department for population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 per cent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with better educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 years of age and older nearly 22 percent of reported residents of Shanghai, identified during the birth rate of one child per couple was located.
Xie lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to "help to reduce the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the shortage in the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not so rich -- as the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual thaw
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy, arguably the most controversial injunction, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- triple up on her annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy, that the critical financial pressure on the country's natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples have had sex - selective abortions, a unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for people have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007, the tone of many hard slogans curbed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials have discussed recently even more radical changes to allow, for example, two children, couples in which one partner is Einzelkind.
Shanghai was in July for the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who for a second child, and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, in order to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing response.
Although officials from a rural town in the external sector of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognize is that after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported against any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, still only four or five requests per month.
Unrequited Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her the best, she said.
Yang jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and legally.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are assessing the one-child policy as the human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh month, is pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples are psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she would like to just one child, because it was also a einzelkind. "we were at the centre of the family and used that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 year-old, heard a translation company, said bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with dual careers, the birth rate is falling, he said, is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see such a life not for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother, her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a life for the best nursery schools have yet."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
The group is drafting a plan to reduce emissions
By wild posturing and mutual accusations by the un climate change conference - until now has set on Friday with the publication of a document, which is a priority for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future, the greatest burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special working group was silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term, so that they can deal with the global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how developed and major emerging countries their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increases should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit cutajar, the Only document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, in order to focus on what the leading climate protection representative come across de boer, the un has described as "the big picture.
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, the countries of the emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The talks on friday, the European Community has a boost by their assurances over the next three years, $3.6 billion per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the champions of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the administration a tougher line with china, as a representative of the Bush administration barely two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take action, stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion about an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he yafei, stating that the leading us climate negotiator either to "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week, that the United states, china, to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers, who bear the costs for the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have moved more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented early Friday morning, a 24 - page draft treaty.
Artur Runge small-scale butchery, the international climate negotiations for the European commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and india.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues must be resolved before the arrival of the government leaders in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Prime entstiegen their aircraft and around through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to be "during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night comedy shows, where they make fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft treaty will be passed from hand to hand rather than by E Mail - is already a challenge.
The intensity builds just: Almost all important ministers are now here on Wednesday and will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Super League, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h speed train defines the Monday feeling newly
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe through the darkness, to announce the departure of a train, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country during his lightning trip from ashfort, kent, to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord adonis, the transport minister, will go to Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter services from london.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the midlands, the north and Scotland to london.
The neglected province could become viable commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to the national carbon emissions and would reduce the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds needed for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British high - speed tracks are still applying the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government will present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, linking London with the West midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site if the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, leading northwards to produce high - speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which an individual high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a railway.
After the completion of the travel time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The draft would be offering the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, which the British rail network would be the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the line in London, Birmingham.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be dealt.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high - speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But even if he set the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains had to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of birmingham, which makes the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours.
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured, a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgages for 75,000 pounds on a Conservative Orangerie
Alan duncan, the leading Conservative member of the house of commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a Orangerie in which he in his house in his constituency build deported.

He was allowed to ask the taxpayer to additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons the applications were approved at the time and they were not challenged by Sir Thomas legg, of carrying out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night, Duncan said that the "not even cleaner or more comprehensible".
Duncan, one of the richest unterhausmitglieder, has a zweistöckiges House in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
In the vicinity of houses have a sale price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and esszimmer, but the Fees office, a spending control of the House of commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has cultivated a winter garden, described the plans as "Orangerie."
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges not to increase borrowing to comment.
The committee has him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules.

The interest rate of Duncans RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the overall increase in funding for the start of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stufenlose RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where he is still standing.
The latest published by the House of Commons documents show that Duncan in this May continue to be entitled to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his job in September as opposition leader of the House of commons, after a Undercover reporters filmed him, when he said after the expenses scandal that Members of Parliament "of meagre rations" would live.
"It basically says, if it works for the state that you live on meagre rations and treated like s * * * * * e."
He said: "i have spent my money for my garden and will be entitled to a tiny part, what is.
And I would call for the whole damn sum, but I do not do it. "
The parliament member, millionaire from his former career as Ölgroßhändler, was attacked because of its expenditure for the first time in may, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the Fees Office that it "could be considered excessive demand."
An activist, as a protest in Duncan pitch a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it became known that he was about three years 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) had demanded.
When he was interviewed last night on the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "this was both by the Fees office, as well as by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about branching out and Durchschlängeln or bend the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and is strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clean and clear. "

Late payments: angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of prison officials on Friday called for a general day of action in order to ensure that the bonuses and overtime, whose pay for budget reasons, postponed until January, before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), urged the staff who have no service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning before the detention center and to block this order to the "theft of what they are entitled" to draw attention.
The union 3. the correctional officers ("CGT Pénitentiaire"), "to a strong mobilisation in various prisons to unite," on which the payment of the overtime incurred in October night increments and Sundays and holidays increments in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable" will gebranntmarkt.
The first trade union of prison officials, the autonomous federal Strafanstaltsunion (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilisations (…) to show the discontent and anger."
The correctional center and the Ministry of Justice said that the overtime in 2009 have increased sharply and were not provided for in the budget. They guarantee, however, that the remaining claims will be paid in january.
As the Justice Department told the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie, the unions of the prison officials sent a letter, in what is guaranteed that the payment in the next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of staff, our prison system and to modernise," shares the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have instructed the leadership of the correctional center to take immediate measures to ensure that such a situation caused by lack of assessment of the overtime, not be repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot marie.

"The staff is not on Sundays and public holidays to work, if the hours of October in december, are not paid for their overtime," there is also the FO Rhone Alpes auvergne.

Continue to give you to bear in mind that this recklessness is poised to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, but in politics as in life would be better to make a name, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by fraudulently acquired a name on it has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt, Francois-Marie Banier, convicted of exploitation of weakness
The Court in Nanterre, on Friday decided to cancel the artists François-Marie Banier, in order to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt, claims that a weak moment of Achtzigjährigen has exploited in order to make a portion of their assets.
The 62 -year-old photographer, who is known for his Star photographs, on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a crime punishable with a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there is indeed a process in this case, the saga of one of the richest families in france, which is the mother and daughter's and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire, l 'hand.
However, the 15 court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-jährigen Liliane Bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the Public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
The doctors should be appointed on Friday before the 10 March 2010, submit a report, in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times are Liliane Bettencourt, in a state of weakness may have been found.
I think this will undergo tests.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer, Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (banier) this old lady, which must be protected, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt, a criminal complaint against François Jean-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler initiated, and accused him, the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings to erschleichen.
Liliane Bettencourt she had always been refuted by the photographers, to have been rigged, which it sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to assess the admissibility of Mrs beds Court-Meyers initiated legal action, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
So, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt to three of his Klientin on their notary were sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the husband of counterparties.
According to her lawyer added Liliane Bettencourt to the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I had fifteen years, one- or twice daily to Banier wrote.
Since she married Françoise, I was never able to speak any more. "
The state prosecutor's office in Nanterre is, once again, the view that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship in recent days, the judge rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane bettencourt "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection, and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "the representative of the Public Prosecutor Marie - Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt, Meyer has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the Strategic early detection?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the companies vis à vis consumer marketing revolution: it is to join the staff "values" determines the best, as it was on the consumer products of the technicians in the station to impose.
By the customer at the heart of the company's marketing revolution of the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place... Although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of f, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; they claimed by the staff to use, which the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a workplace revolution, which would be the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very conditional use of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his wage workers, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear.
- first, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many detours, finally, to do... What it has always done.
Also because of the growing authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders of a much simplified notion of human behaviour.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology of mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the us American "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, it suggests that it is possible to operate the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro.fr appeared poll by Ipsos executives confirmed in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilization of factors to identify and measure
Instead, presupposes a necessary occupational revolution for the smooth functioning of the modern enterprise for the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of steering a fundamental minutes: for the workers is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly as a means of a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Now only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set, which allows them through their widely-perceived picture of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can mobilise the executives of the companies' social services ", to predict and anticipate and their human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
The speech by Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right one
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United states has defended.
The conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 october, applauded this time of the speech by the president, the example of the former Vizepräsidentschafts candidate in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good job".
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of obama's.
In some parts of habeich this speech seen as historic, said said in the radio show "the takeaway" was interviewed.
The Member of Parliament by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased with a "President of the left" to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and not passing on a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former recorder of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to the fact that he is "cosmopolitan", as he always does, "he said," as an American President, "as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they themselves have created for their protection and do a lot, "Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos."
On the left of the President of the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
Packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles times, which is still of the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to obama, described the speech itself for a speaker, who is known for his talent, as a "monumental".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that obama, "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time.
Drivers: Three marathon for an agreement that ensures the supply at Christmas.

The conflict, "the company very much harm" and "it was feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"It is not very much, but we are starting small," Clos (fo).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers.
"It will probably always some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult to give this wage increases in the face of international competition. "
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said on "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the increase in the travel costs by 3% and the objectives of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, in particular, the issue of 13. monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that the drop in taxes on employers to the tune of 100 million euros, "the subject of an amendment was" the government on the bill of the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted on Thursday night on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and that they then applies in the event of an extension of the Minister for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in a very short period of time," assured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade", because the euro 100 million "were the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose eaters in the approaching Christmas days to avoid disgruntling, laments the unostra.
For the Association Otre threatens the agreement "to small and medium - sized companies in the sector in the next 12 months, a major digging."

The SNCF on the RER A or in the direction of Cergy - Le - skin - powered trains came and went on the Saint - Lazare train station, in order to guarantee the end of the Metros.

Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdish party Decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of a Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision on which immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to end the 25 years of conflict to an end.

The decision followed a in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdur Rahman Yalçinkaya operational procedures. He accused the dtp, the "command" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (pkk), which is viewed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase the PKK rebels.
The party, "no link" to the pkk, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the constitutional court transmits the government, which is trying to accommodate the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, support for the pkk, the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.

That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"this decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island.
"You can be a reaction from the pkk," he adds.
On thursday, the PKK to an attack in which three days earlier killed seven soldiers in the north of turkey. It was one of the most brutal attacks over the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded secret site for defence research.
Today, the town hall with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nano here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location location - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (fiz).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt and signed a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, to frankfurt, Planungsdezernent Edwin black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium - sized enterprises in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts travel for a seminar after Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed to take the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want Russian science firms jockeying for orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electrons technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The Municipality was founded in 1958 as a so - called "socialist planned city" for the defence research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") got its name from the forested hills landscape in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the deeper set of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in chaos ludicrously construction site.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time as verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19 th century, which acted as a modern rail transport, since it took a lot of time, umzuspannen locomotives from behind.
In short, drive - to go further ".
And that is why the stations: in Frankfurt and munich.
And in stuttgart: a passage at the half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that he and the Bavarian city is almost priceless, the low down.
Head stations have also, however, no entry and exit problem anymore, since there are modern turning trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local politicians.
The train, not least because the risks of the largest infrastructure Einzelprojekts of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
The project is still reasonably justified.
New city area, which, according to the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system is harmful.
The transit railway station and the route expansion are intended for the movement of the 1980s - typically, brought huge growth.
At that time, there were no competition from low - cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first go to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is not because of intense climbs for freight trains.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear is that in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 kilometre route across the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, will be built on the route in slow motion.
So desperately needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The race will be for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the airport.
The provincial government has left open the Wiesbadener Landtag, whether they will go against the judgment of the hessischen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights in revision.

It is hellishly difficult, if We must keep its word, said green chief Tareq Al Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep his word".
The minister refuted the accusation by the provincial government attempts to come to terms with "and" but their night flights.
A precise legal examination of their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition, are the statements of his group, the ban on night flights.

The troubled us banks their government shackles.

A snap election
It was then faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Governing Board, the acting editor Nicholas Brender had pushed out, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
As the favourite Peter frey, the head of the ZDF capital studios in berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it will also have played a role, the zdf-intendanten Markus Schächter should not further damage, this proposal to the board of directors will not be retained.
Frey, a candidate needs the support of nine of the 14.
The outcome of the vote was not in the print edition yet.
Two weeks ago, was Schächter with his proposal to extend the contract with Nicholas Brender for a further five years, failed on the board.
Only seven members of languages for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for Schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not wanting to confirm in office.
Organised by the opposition against the editor-in-chief of the Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF in ratings, has refused to accept another term of office of the highly-regarded chief journalist.
Until just before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Finally, 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the Koch entered as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
The person.
Peter Frey on 4 August was born in 1957 in Bing.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.
Afterward, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey changed the ZDF, first on the "Today", Journal.
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist; 1991 / 92 correspondent in washington; by 1998 head and moderator of "morning magazine"; by 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF capital studios.
The Greens after the dismissal brenders, announced on Wednesday by the journal medium industries was elected to the journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the Management Board, the Rhineland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF-state contract so that staff proposals of Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of the zdf, however, beck.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - the body immediately after the dismissal angrily criticised for doing so.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence could elect him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a partisan office.
In the will, in any case, the liberal left-wing Frey.
The study will be entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Ministers of the countries on Thursday finally: At a meeting of Ministers of Education and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to study conditions at the Bachelor and Master of wanting to improve.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
In particular, they agreed to in principle, to reduce the burden: each study module is only with a single test.
In addition to reviewing the workload of the students and "a realistic and reasonable level".
Politics and universities also want the recognition of audit services between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries should not be beyond them.
Fewer tests.
Since the beginning of the student protests in june, education and Uni vice-chancellors dictum of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of audits, in part: "each module, with only one test," it said in a 30 -page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part.
With the "significant reduction of the audit of proof," said the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted."
Moreover, the "Studierbarkeit" in the future, "the critical factor" in the design.
Modules are "rigorously checked to see" whether "unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of the
Events "would be avoided.
The students' right to maintain margins, and promote the initiative ".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "- which means that it will take until 2015, until all the reviewed studies.
Responsible for ten accreditation agencies, which are the accreditation, created by the countries of the council.
The Ministers had the countries in October "strongly urged" to put pressure on the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too stringent verification regime.
In individual Länder, universities and colleges with the Landesministerien already agreed to take appropriate measures.
So far as the only country in the Rhineland-Palatinate said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money to the universities, above all, set up and studies advice and audit and auslandsämter.
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the higher education law to parliament.
This will be necessary for the conclusion of a study model only one test.
The study design should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and access to the master.
By the end of next year all the courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit be reviewed.
The government and the opposition had argued on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of the Juso school groups, the design of the education policy should no longer "behind closed doors," the Minister and university chancellors.
After the latest educational strike should now also the students "have a say."
The future graduates received support from the President of the university Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The trade union education and science (gew) by the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim, each graduates with a Bachelor close access to a secondary Masters course.
On the other hand, must ensure the countries that for the current generation of students Bachelor tomorrow sufficiently Masters with the best possible conditions studies available, so GEW board member Andreas keller.
The countries need to hire more teachers.
To a freer access to the master, the Culture minister, however.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller.
In Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of a poem that includes the Lyrikers Werner söllner, in which this troubling Sprachfetzen experience the arrival of dissidents, who won the freedom, but has lost its language area.
The 1951 born in Romanian Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as teachers worked in a children's book publishers before it moves in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literary prize, 1993, the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Mousonturm Hessischen literary forum in Frankfurt.
For major außerliterarisches last Tuesday during a meeting in munich, in the "german literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files."
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Helmuth frauendorfer, his cooperation as im for the Romanian securitate.
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist, Werner Söllner is in the Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize homage to Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule is the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors originating from Romania shaken by a case of the spectators and the Dutch recognizable costume of a political system, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, after previous knowledge, not just perpetrators, but victims.
In his securitate-akte have played a role in Walter, said after the confession Söllners the literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel, for him, and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it in the sensitive points for him at the time, "markel."
It is a moral need to make comment.
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpectedly, surprise is the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service, however.
Germany was a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in july at the time, after having their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people concerned, so we must presume, speculation and in some case may also have known what plain name was behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the country is now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the Birthler agency founded the National Council for processing the Securitate-files (CNSAS) was not until 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the management of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief Temesvar dismissive about the Prize.
They have a psychosis, finally, they have interrogated only once.
The scandal of power, said quite openly in the shape of the freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case Söllner tie, as so often in connection with the need to blame the inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of The Zuhörenden Söllners commitment gives hope that The continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League
It was as if there is a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party, which had distributed a sporting goods manufacturers Goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class.
The man with the enormous shaven heads chauffieren left him because of the tourist city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive themselves - alcohol was not in the game and eventually besoffen before luck was the 55 year-old as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work.
Or just right away.
In the words of the first three days earlier pledged Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final, namely" in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be fooled by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then, in Mainz the royal class performance in the League - to life again.
And the once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots.
The eighth finals of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be chosen by lots as scrutineers in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of winning the commencement of the successor was.
Not only with the supposed saviours, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short term self-confidence, dedication and love of the game.
I am on the players and told them that they should consider their strengths, and have encouraged them to be brave souls plumber Gross, said the simple recipe for success, which had been under Therapeut Babbel but no effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel Jens lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, we would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after a verletzungspause thanks to his dynamism go straight to the best players on the place in the attempted "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind," and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had been lacking self - evident.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sports bureau Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but continuity.
As Gross herding players and managers, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely swamped and deal with the Romanian guests.
They have also won in glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 will wake up to bear in mind.
And sports bureau, Horst Heldt reminded that, although a season goal has been achieved, but it is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not expected, was on the events of the weekend in the form of a direct broadcast television interviews before games start by gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh revived.
There are decisions that other meetings and not the Jens, countered the Lehmanns Heldt harsh criticism.
The board of leadership had been accused of and have decided to change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after games had been deleted, Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "pure egotism," keilte Heldt, vowing serious consequences for the final man.
They will no longer friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all the others agree that without the preparatory work by the team of coach who replaced the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann all - and the man with the plastic bag, too.
In the heavyweight Fight in World Cup
Hitziges duel in Bern: continually provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy - weight title after version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains Box in the heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 119, 120, 108, 109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainians was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it has knocked out all expected to have not worked out.
Klitschko built his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he had twice beaten because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had suffered the first defeat in 24 fight.
Around 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena wanted to dictate the 2.02 metres tall Klitschko the fight, especially with his left hand.
Of the 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the duel before the end of the Klitschko-era, but always evade the blows of the champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights into the decisive goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and sought only through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely.
He is, after all, is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some furore.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly" zombie, "not right".
The mother-to-be was the champion then on Friday to provoke, Johnson the sun glasses of the nose, "in order to be able to see his eyes."
The fourth after the Klitschkos comeback victory.
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008 victory.
After almost four years time, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "his" recovered WBC belt, which he had previously made without a fight.
This year he defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September, Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only have a stroke in this fight, and I am physically very well in the form had justified the rapid return to the ring.
His dream, but the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is WBO and IBF world champion of the associations.
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye, after this in November the 2.13 meter Nikolai walujew.
Haye had earlier in the summer, cancelled a planned for September fight against Vitaly klitschko.
Supposedly, whose promotion company is now planning the fight against Klitschko in London Wembley stadium.
Kunduz case.
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair described as a liar.
The spd and Left sought clarification of the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the recent findings on the air attack by the opposition has Kunduz Defence Minister Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (csu) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol lorry in September "knowingly the falsehood," said Jürgen Trittin said Greens Group leader on Saturday in the ARD television news show "-" days.
It is called the popular: he lied.
The order to kill was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO, Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just a destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
Us air strikes were requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, according to report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
The SPD, Greens and Left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government of Afghanistan policy - and whether chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens Renate künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not refer to specific operations in the armed forces in afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tanklaster-anschlags.
Officially, it was told that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and the Minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Ministry of Defence even have pointed to several reports, including a bilateral document of small orders haves Colonel and a Feldjägerbericht.
Wichert is now in a letter asking for clarification of the facts, "the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sunday newspaper reported."
He had not yet received a Reply, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday to the allegations and pointed out that this will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the bundestag, who formed next wednesday.
Dream worlds.
Some people see in wachem state pictures and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurred the boundaries between reality and imagination.
As long as it happens in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should have exacerbated the wildest imagination and fantasy creations.
However, who guards his dream - like conditions experienced sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, mostly in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicts, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that will enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
Traumartig modified guard awareness, can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case.
Even if may differ cause and effect, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations, but similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin theme and the interaction of various parts of the brain.
Complex hallucinations and delusions thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and scientists since antiquity.
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861, a "great similarity of misleading one with dream", Sigmund Freud was the dream "a climate of fear, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is a multi - dimensional and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him saying vicious form with blood red, distorted Fratzen zähnefletschend,.
They chase him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet it a noose and strapped her in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and the noose around the neck.
The maid.
The noose is replacing.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning t. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, he is a maniac low, he takes medication, against the depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness for three years, he is married.
In the psychosis, I have seen the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals treated it as the second most common cancer after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are in a state of übererregten, the hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution.
The vote is particularly prevalent - order hearing voices, or comment on dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is important to distinguish between what is trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is being inundated with impressions.
As the dream also opens the psychosis of the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the psychosis is zentriert entity, says Professor Thomas fox, head doctor of the clinic for General Psychiatry in the university clinics Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the event, everything has been directed at him.
At the same time, in a passive role, he will, as the dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and cannot be actively.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality, is not possible, the medical images are cruel reality, it ends.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a Halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why is our brain researchers antics, is still a mystery.
Exceptional circumstances can lead in every person that he loses in the short term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain neuronal maturing at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fox explained.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, the first for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if that is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, as they entered the transmitter system.
If our brains
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money for drugs, in order to get, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich caste.
Whether related images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
It collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and related phenomena, last year, he has his results in The book "The unreal world in our head" evaluated.
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Border Line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, consists of contents, which would normally be withheld.
They arise if brain parts, which will be processed, initially or too little; if our brains hot or, if there is no challenge.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love mental distress or other emergency situations.
In recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in the life of hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl.
If not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
If he says, at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. dreams, it knows it.
She is awake, they see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank to see or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for Moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may hold the boys.
Am I crazy? she sometimes wonders.
But they know that this boy and the other medical images are real and disappear again.
At night, are the most frightening phenomena
The images are also often wore a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, it can sometimes do not follow the teaching materials, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new Mitschüler, while for all other hearing and visible from the blackboard mathematical equations explained.
At night, the most frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake, or whether the pictures, which sees them, the Fratzen or the girl to the arms and legs, with the bleeding before their eyes open or closed.
Let me in peace, the characters.
Parents and friends told them that they would be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah k. is now 20 years old.
Last year she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes has admitted that it knows well that it is not crazy.
Obsession is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or under appeal withdrawal, he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, they often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they called Papa, since they can think, not her biological father.
As visual and audio hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah k. difficult to distinguish related images and reality. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also late - night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in a position to recognize their medical images as unrealistic.
It advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state of affairs between dream and hallucinations
In our world too much bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience often, alas, says Michael Schmidt rapier hardware, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - cow is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt rapier hardware has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of the traumartig modified public awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed virtual dreams of Erlebende for real, and he also does not distinguish the awake state in hindsight.
The oneiroide mentality is in a state of trauma or illness caused by extreme situations, for example, Polyradikulitis patients in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
By continuing total impotence, for example, if a person is threatened by loss of self- and world, he replaced the real situation, through their own imaginary world, the reality is, says Schmidt rapier hard.
A kind of border state between dreams and hallucinations.
Since the completion of a situation in the reality is not possible, a global exchange, but the real situation in the Imagination.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and win in an intolerable situation, which allows people to design their own ability, not submerged in a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, later in the memory
Even the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body in the intensive care unit to Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen, one in a selbstgeschaffene world, is visiting alien times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot watchdog over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs from blood.
By the Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee trafficked in the Alps and hits a Korean mafioso.
He is completely in the imaginierten, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel to distinguish itself from any dream.
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys and even after years in the minor details.
And even more bemused than real experience.
The intensity of this goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience, says the psychiatrist.
At the end of the show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and Drogenrausch how fragile our internal given the external reality in the guards.
Any change of status, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be rewarding.
The snow can fall
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda his company in the hands of his two children, he said the spiegel.
The holding company will also in future to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children heirs with 27 years and have the firm desire to enter into the company, said the 69 year-old the mirror.
The details have been settled.
The question of whether they are active in the company, only.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
You can easily ask staff his children, if they are not enough.
This brings the children and the company.
Burda had on Thursday announced that he was withdrawing from January from the board chair, and Paul - Bernhard Kallen, appointed to his successor.
The 52 year-old Kallen in Burda is a member of the board since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later came with the treasury, the responsibility for the corporate wealth and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time is not a family member at the top of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also, "10 to 15 years," burda.
The Holding should continue to 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases and Schickedanz Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not above the sinking are safe: "It was always families who were infected by a capital addiction, which is completely verspekuliert and thought they could rise as the great player.
My strategy was unknown.
He had "never had dreams of world power," Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to be a player in the world league with "Time ', these shops have become too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can read only his E mails, without an opportunity to be able to see certain annexes or surf the internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is unlikely to see on the streets, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smart Phones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half the price of a flat rate of an iphone.
After the company has seen success, it has two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, in which we must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek Le Web was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to dispense with all the data, in order to be able to read his e-mails, once you cross the border or if you are desperately seeking a café with WIFI (or a combination possibility with fon).
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone operators already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read about all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always.
But half of their own country has always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
That is a small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing is that it has the name of fon, although it has no Wifi / wlan) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly but surely rethink and start to various options to consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in his prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I hope one day of FonPeek, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United states.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Michelle
Gelb is, without a doubt, the American First lady.
At the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and the same stuff, and it was something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that at the first sight seemed that the First Lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes in the cloth, from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and in Oslo from gemusterten velvet.
The accessories were different: the first time Green shoes with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair was different: the hair were put on this occasion as hair wreath, with the previous bore the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women to study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see curtailed their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity.
The study reveals that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who work outside the home, no other work only part-time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the drawing, a figure that has to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this and together and the first child until much later.
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of preparedness, "explains the csic, Margarita Margarita delgado.
The level of education is another factor that in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child is even higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women of the same age.

Cowardly aggression.
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our city last week in the town of Fuenlabrada, suddenly herliefen as a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog, our dog is a Mischling that we have taken from the animal sanctuary and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue she gave him two Fußtritte and injured so badly missed him.
Our indignation, one can never capture in words incomprehensible to us, because it is where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which is, of course, to the leash.
The attack, a woman who cosy top-ranking, these people as a result of the incident, they wanted to chastise; indeed, they feared for their own lives, because if a Wahnsinniger attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps also with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet town at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary tuesday.
The dog has spent all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nahgelegenen police service, however, we have grave doubts as to whether it will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were spaniards.
Our outrage at what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what is going on in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, to an animal, which we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and people.

The sale of small trucks is rising again slightly
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks are finally beginning to see light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months will decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with caution, because the comparison data become available in November 2008, which is a particularly bad with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the Gesamtzulassungen this 11 months is still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles sold in this number, but all vehicles, which is Kleintransporter market: Descendants of passenger cars, Pick ups, small trucks, small vans and light vans / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
So we need to these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten cries of credit institutions, other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this landscape, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little help.
This plan is intended not only for individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to a small trucks up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 ausstoss, must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, had Ganvam reminded us that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small trucks and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealers association predicted for the year 2010 a year, as the last, for which it with a loss of sales (in passenger cars and suvs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was the case with the ABS and how it is now with the ESP stability control, must be on the brakes in emergency situations in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles, a transition period until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, however, can help these systems on the basis of their operation to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers, the system on the basis of the drivers Bremsstärke carried out on the brake pedal.
However, this system is not pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned inquiry, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the toss, not more, on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the Bremszeit and thus also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even fewer accidents, it is estimated that every fourth accident with injury could be prevented, as soon as the so-called intelligent braking systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then, it helps the system to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the toss is unavoidable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January.
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (zaragoza) by Nick reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (gm) europe, have been informed that the production of the new will launch in the first week of april, probably on 8, according to Mr ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick reilly, the new chairman of GM europe, to ensure that the affected side their consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and postpone the governments of the countries in which it works, to be presented by the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen GM said that it will in the next few days, a decision on the sale of saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer, so that a decision as soon as possible.
Gm exists, with some potential new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be geely, which also would like to buy volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which the Russian group Conv later backing, more and more.
If none of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel was used by the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kilograms.
In order to create something, refrained from first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms, thanks to the aluminium used in this model, the GT3 "disappear" another 15; the removal of the air conditioning again in 13; it has also reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that were saved another 7 kilograms; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet seats again in 12 and with the slight 19 customs wheels back five.
Then there was even through the renunciation of the audio system CDR - 30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of doors grip from substance abuse by the lack of kilo achieved.
Although he was also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride in a car with a 6 - normal hand wheels carried out mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes, the very kurvig.
In his drive to give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but that does not mean he is now no longer so sure on the pitch.
Rather, the opposite is the case: we do not have long since probegefahren more a small and easy model, which is also a feeling of security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders, to lawn, too slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything that we do with our hands on The steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise.
And he makes it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes.
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and you can still raise it with the'sport' -Option and by means of a system that can change the engine sounds, which already on the Panamera was used for the first time.
The acceleration is unimaginable, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads, where the Boxster spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants on the whole route almost nothing at all to do; and that, although we found some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt in the morning.
In summary, we can say that there is a ultraleichtes car, a car, which has a Fahrspass indescribable, as it is rare, and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.

The Baskonia paying themselves a victory in Israel.
The Caja Laboral story, in spite of the many popular players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, a magnificent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex fuβballfeld of the Maccabi Electra and thus ends up in the first place in its group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple the best of his team was (29 in the evaluation).
The team from vitoria, the significant loss of Mr mann, oleson, Huertas or Micov replaced by a great sense of commitment and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end to its victory.
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue red, which from the beginning of the top of the ads.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came from the Perimeter, one could guess that they had come onto the pitch with good Handgelenken reheated.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava opted for a innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, which is home to extend their advantage further before the break (34 - 43).
Teletovic began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points, including the "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of the brazilian.
Despite the was the game despite the clear advantage in the recess is far from decided and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone wins on the pitch, and thanks to the "hand of elías" they came into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50 to 49).
Even more disadvantages.
The team of ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to regain the air and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that ads on the table again einberuhigender refrain from (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make.
The Alavesen last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) has already announced that it would allow anyone to them the victory they had earned in the first thirty minutes honest, taking away again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried to give their team by three points from the line (70 - 77).
Despite this, and although cluster because fouls being sidelined, the team of ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis nor in the last minute (80 - 85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter were the andalusians start to dream. a aggresive Defence and three consecutive times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12 - 18 in the 9 th minute.
Olympiacos, of the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a home match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22 / 20 in their favour, indicate the minute, following a campaign in which it almost to the brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and so would have both been disqualified.

Among their players in the domestic sphere, and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with his triple, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 to 32.

Thank you!
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which is certainly not surprising, since this is their natural state of affairs, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets, it was with the direct purchase of assets to pay the debt and indirectly the liquidity free rein in interest rates, the move to the zero, so that the banks' assets to the way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses will rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts they achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the eurozone countries in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
A degree of uncertainty on the other hand, the defenders of the moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects, to which the restriction of loans had led to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have adopted a new day thanks to action.
Nevertheless, what happened in dubai, a tribal war between the emiren, in order to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously forecast.
A government that the public debt, elections and a new government, which in the same hymn.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the external payments and therefore a euro member country, no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of außergewöhnlicchen measures in order to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are, as expected, in an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after some lending to large sums of money, and it would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of the debt with the same speed as the European Unternehmensboni increase.
If, however, the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn would further increase, it is a special Spanish risk.

The chairman of iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez galán, resigned as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the house, where the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural fenosa, Rafael Villaseca Galán, gave the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola of Spain needs to invest 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion by 2030 from that date, will depend on the fact that the current nuclear power stations to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020 will change the question and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to damp down the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he estimated that 18,000 megawatts more, under the will of course, by other "stützenergien."
Galán, is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say in no case against this law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, which is the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, clearly in this direction, despite some" individual "measures, such as the chairman of iberdrola.
It says galán, that the decisions on the investment, even if they are, in the long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.

The French company Bouygues and the German high plains are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona, in the country as a construction company and motorway operators.

The first company is one of the largest construction company australia, while the second, based in italy, is one of the best specialists in production.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is in a close election, called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn to ACS), which also includes local Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructures promises huge construction and privatisations, however, has a hurdle to overcome, because it is only through the purchase of a local invoice.
A strategy of the companies cited high deep or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian credentials, followed by the Spanish Baugiganten has yet to be prosecuted.
Even ACS to this market has only through his participation of 30 per cent in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton, gained entry.
