Congress gave way to: The US government can into the banks napumpovat 700 billion 
NEJVYŠŠÍ leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on the broad terms of the agreement on financial aid for the US financial system.

Goal, however, is not yet. 
Members of Congress, they must finish with some of the details of the agreement will be able to publish the final version of the bill, and a vote on it. 
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday. 
On Sunday, said that the agency Reuters the chairman of the Committee for the banking and financial services to the House of Barney Frank. 
In the Senate, would, according to sources, could vote on the plan seems to be first in the center. 
According to the economists should be the notification of the approval of the rescue plan, the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets. 
Then, however, the "being sobered" due to the complexity of the mechanisms, such as the help of markets to achieve even in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective

We grapple with our different views about how to look like a form of a package to stabilise the market, "stated for the agency Bloomberg democrat Nancy Pelosiová. 
According to her could come to a final vote on Sunday.

"We are on the brink of a definitive agreement plan, which will work and must be on the market as well as effective. 
It is to be in the restoration plan to continue, but I think we are there, "said Paulson. 
The signal for the Asian trading 
The global financial crisis has significantly on the stock markets, which have declined sharply. 
According to the nevadského democratic Senator Harry Reid chap, as policymakers try to ensure that Congress reached a definitive agreement on Sunday. 
The fact that they want to reassure investors before the trading on the Asian financial markets, which are in a time zone, first, that the decisions of Congress could affect pondělní trading. 
In the meantime, however, is not yet in the clear, when both chambers of the U.S. Congress to vote on the law, or whether they are in negotiations at the last minute uváznout for some of the problem. 
Policymakers hope that it will be approved in the next few days. 
The law, however, even from a series of changes. 
CELKOVÁ amount for the assistance of the system should be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion to be available as soon as possible, as demanded by President George Bush. 
Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it will have the impression that the program to carry out its function, and in an additional $100 billion, and then the final 350 billion. 
Bush appreciate the progress in the negotiations, 
The president may this decision to veto, but Congress may his veto přehlasovat. 
Despite these changes, however, remained the basic idea of the programme, which was to get the funds to buy bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages. 
"We now have a all.. 
Sněmovna Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd, Gregg. 
Is happy with the progress in the negotiations and the American President Bush. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush is sobotním progress satisfied and valued "of a bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Gold OMEZENÍ parachutes 
The chairman of the banking committee Senators Christopher Dodd, a leading negotiator, said that lawmakers have agreed to responsibility for the amount of money to the program, protect taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of the relief, the timing of the financing of the plan. 
NOVÝ law has also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for director společnostní participating in the program, and a Committee, which will have over the Fund surveillance. 
He should be guided by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We worked very hard on it and we made a lot of progress towards an agreement that will work and that it will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan is also to help for homeowners who have problems with paying off. 
The government should negotiate a new payments on the mortgages, which purchase, with the aim of reducing the monthly cost of the payments for borrowers and enable them so that they can keep their homes. 
Marek: Psychological assistance 
The proposed plan, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance David, Mark, a good idea, but it will be very difficult for its implementation. 
"And that, therefore, that he did not know what mechanism, and at what price the problem assets will be bought. 
It will be considered for how to divide between themselves, the loss of the financial sector and the government, "he said this week for the server iHNed.cz Marek. 
If the plan is approved by now, or the beginning of next week, according to Mark so substantial. 
"More importantly, this týdenkongresmani agreed that this plan will support, and that it posvětí as soon as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement of the approval, he is, at the moment, the most important thing, "he emphasized Marek. 
The contest on the knife's edge: MP3 players against mobilům... 
Poradíme, how choose 
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call. 
In fact, it seems clear that it is better to buy a phone call. 
Yet there are plenty of reasons to ensure that you have acquired a player. 
It entirely depends on the use and the claims of the future of the owner. 
It is hard to think about home pořídíte cutting-edge dear gramofon, you need to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, to such musical products at the LP and constitute and qualitative criteria for that there is no objective reason. 
Tísní-li, however, in your regálech vinyly with Art rock jazzem or blues, probably on a record player at least dreaming. 
STEJNÉ it with music on the roads, the music komprimovanou, collectively - music in the MP3. 
And there are the price and quality of the category. 
For someone may be unacceptable spend player eight thousand crown, as well as a fan Pink Floyd to zkousne headphones for twenty crown from the market. 
The two extremes, among which is enough room for everyone. 
Is a broad VÝBĚR. 
It shall act and the resilience of batteries 
NĚKTERÉ high-end audio players be far more than just play music, but what most mobilů or by accident. 
None of the current apparatus is not as universal as the phone. 
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and esemeskování, can play music and video, both record, has the better, worse camera and can even navigovat. 
And when taking into account the smartphony and komunikátory, you will have in his pocket and a small computer. 
This is a small miracle, no sounds cannot broiled and no television, no nevyfotografuje. 
The universality of mobile phone brings and disadvantages. 
The more functions to the mobile phone use, the sooner you indicator on display sends to nabíječce. 
And the playback of music is one of the largest žroutů energy. 
Few mobile phone can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, the majority, it is much less. 
In this direction are music players (specifically the simplest) significantly more productive. 
In the case of cheap mobilů therefore expect that for more than a few hours' play. 
If you want to call it here and there, get to work for the security of another nabíječku - this is true for more expensive equipment. 
In the case of MP3 players, you won ’ t have this problem, even worse lasts at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge. 
Another problem occurs when recording music into the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the apparatus has a universal plug USB, and not all of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software. 
Of course, the music, it is possible to directly on the audio memory card, but few reader cards without any reduction to consult with miniature memory cards, which are used in mobilech. 
In the case of the players to the exceptions (iPod), no special software need it. 
Just instrument to fulfill the music through a USB port on a computer. 
Most mobilů and the players have already itself creates music library řazenou under the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or evaluation of the user. 
NĚKTERÉ apparatus will only stromovou structure directories, like an explorer in Windows, and some are good at both of them (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system). 
Players are easier to handle, mobily more they 
The selection of a particular device zajímejte PŘI, in particular the resilience of battery, storage capacity, quality and type of audio output, and, of course, and the komfort control. 
If you music primarily kulisou and budete-li to hear it every day, just as in the tram, do you have any mobile phone, who plays MP3. 
COŽ already can really almost any mobile phone. 
It ’ s not too much to see what music formats mobile phone or the player can. 
MP3 be all of them, and the vast majority of music that you, it will be just in this format. 
One of the most universal and other than it can handle the vast majority of instruments and music in WMA format. 
The less the AAC format used by Apple and its iPody). 
A better mobily also allow, for example, to purchase music in on-line. 
Just over the mobile Internet to visit the site operator (or any other provider) and the song or album to purchase. 
This service would no longer itself could be a compelling argument for the acquisition of musical mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, the phone is low and reduces the majority on rychlokvašené radio hits. 
Prices, too, are the lowest. 
OBECNĚ, however, that it is this way of sales of music (whether via GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) into the future opanuje music industry. 
A mobile phone, most people wear still with him. 
Whenever you want to listen to, cell phone in the pocket nahmatáte, while the MP3 player lie unremembered at home. 
JEŠTĚ, however, depends on whether to also always carrying headphones, or at least the wired handsfree. 
If not, you can take advantage of the integrated speaker, who is almost every cell phone, but only the minimum of MP3 players. 
Some of the biggest advantage of musical mobilů will be, for many of the price. 
The cheapest is normally under three thousand. 
For the three and four of the crown already pořídíte very decent walkman. 
However, the majority of you will restrict the absence of the exit to the normal earphones. 
The best and after the technical aspect of nejvybavenější phones with 3.5 mm normal headphone jack for standing up to 15, 000. 
Advantage of players, inter alia, easy handler. 
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players could really control each. 
The minimum functions, the similarity of control with a previously ordinary kazeťákem or gramofonem is clear. 
There is no collisions in the form of a mistaken zapnutého mobile Internet and, subsequently, a giant account for the transmission of data. 
After which on the apparatus. 
Even the cheapest mobily (such as Vodafone 527) have a slot on the removable memory card (the type of M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even with the dokoupením the cards to enter into two thousand. 
I will, however, be careful. 
In the case of the basic models are only supported the card with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive to consult with the 8 GB paměťovkami... 
If you have a mobile phone, and you will still buy cheap MP3 player, reach out for Cowonu, Creativu, Sony, Samsungu, Emgetonu or iriveru. 
According to the capacity of the (max. 2 GB) you have to spend more than 1 in 100. 
If you are to the tougher audience reach out to the specialized mobilech - walkmanech (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy). 
These instruments have separate control buttons for MP3 and komfort operator, so close to an independent MP3 player. 
As it is in the field of Sony Ericsson, whose mobily from a series of walkman have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players. 
The same service, and in the same price category four thousand crown, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and outlasted the battery (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), you will be MP3 players from the abovementioned marks. 
The first virtual operator arrive in Česka already in 2008. 
Perhaps it 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic, is a relatively sophisticated, and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe. 
Yet here we are missing something - the virtual operator, which would be those classic forced zlevnit. 
Perhaps will not miss out for a long time. 
The fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we are on Mobil.cz wrote many times. 
Indeed, said that even ČTÚ, who pointed out that the price of the SMS is for us is higher than in the rest of the Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation roamingových fees, so perhaps there is the irony of the situation - for some customers Czech mobile phone SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic, is in comparison with Europe so high? 
The answer is simple, the lack of competition, which would really wanted to go into a fight. 
Perhaps it is, paradoxically, there still three mobile networks and penetration high over 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like they lament that the Czech market is extremely competitive. 
In that they often says and the President of the Council CZECH telecommunications office (ČTÚ), Paul Dvořák, who had several times in the past, for another operator in the Czech Republic, the place is not. 
It is probably true that classic operator with their own networks probably does not have much of a chance (in fact, it would be hard to find the frequency). 
But there is one more possibility - a virtual operator. 
PRÁVĚ entry virtual operators in the mobile market, had brought a sharp reduction in prices, which then had to respond and classical operators. 
Yet even before the entry into force of the jack as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market demonstrated in Great Britain similar votes as for us. 
But it turned out that the place for such operators and can be a really successful. 
After all, we need for examples of go too far. 
In February of this year, we you informed on the verge of virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
For half a year, the authorising this year to more than 100,000 customers and become its fifth largest operator. 
But for Mobilkingem is the financial group of penta which, in the Czech Republic, its own, inter alia, U: Fona. 
Virtual operators benefit is the ability to focus on a specific age group. 
In order to be able to work effectively, they just far fewer customers than classical authorising... 
They shall not bear with a relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network. 
In a world with so virtual operators usually profilují as nízkonákladoví - offer a cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced closer the supply of services. 
So be Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom, offers a SMS at least half of the more cheaply than its competitors. 
But it shows an example of how Mobilkingu in Poland, it may be quite a good slice and betting on neotřelou target group. 
The operator is focused specifically on the man. 
"SPRÁVNÍ men choosing Mobilking - ing, which they like and to whom they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, engaged in this virtual operator. 
It is hard to say whether it would be similar to the concept as in Poland, and for us. 
Doubt press spokesman Vodafonu Miroslav Čepický: "Czech market is relatively small for segmentový approach, which is most of the virtual operators based. 
Moreover, it is from the point of view of the supply of services relatively saturovaný. " 
In the Czech Republic, without the chance, they say the mobile operators 
But it seems almost certain that, when in the Czech Republic, a virtual mobile operator will, it will not be Mobilking. 
"The expansion of a successful project we are talking in the Czech Republic, but negotiations are too is hopeful. 
Rather, it is to start Mobilkingu in other countries of the region, "she said in an interview Mobil.cz telefonickém John Studničková, a spokesman for the financial group of penta. 
Indirectly, confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic, this idea certainly inclined not. 
Rather, on the contrary, it is trying to do everything possible to any potential competitor emerged. 
Concern about the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already a longer period of time when the GTS Novera, which would have wanted to make the next step in order to become a real closest Telefóniky O2 in the field of corporate customers. 
"We have a great interest on to our customers could offer only a solid, but also the mobile telecommunications services. 
And that the sooner, the better. 
On this, we have repeatedly deal with all the Czech mobilními operators. 
With some of them, we have succeeded in negotiations move, "says a press spokesman for the group of Paul Kaidl. 
It is therefore blýská for better times. 
From the unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator perhaps we should wait until the end of the year. 
But his prozatím is like the emergence of a wall of silence. 
"At this point, nedomníváme, that it is the place of the market space for the emergence of a full virtual operator. 
Czech market is compared to other markets are very specific. 
Yet none of us neoslovil body with the complex and serious project in this area, "he said in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from printing department Telefóniky O2. 
For the specificity of the English market mantle and other operators. 
A spokesman for the T-Mobilu Martin Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the expression of the O2: "We nezaznamenali no viable and mutually convenient commercial project, in which it would be possible to build." 
And, he adds: "In the network T-Mobilu, until the end of the year is a virtual operator. 
At this point we would have had to have on the table a specific agreement, in order to be considered in this short term. " 
Vodafone focused their attention more to meet the requirements of its own 3 g licence. 
Miroslav Čepický says: "Negotiations with potential virtual operators we are open to and, especially in the area of sharing the costs and infrastructure. 
We PRÁVĚ it from the point of view of customers for nejpřínosnější. 
The main strategies Vodafonu in this area is finding a partner to create a shared network for fast mobile internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with the operators of one hand 
The cell phone can easily understand the entry of another operator would mean an increase in the competition, has led to a decline in prices and a decline in their profits. 
Why is the emergence of such konkurentovi to facilitate? 
The fact that, when the operators of something, they move at one end of a rope, and a scramble around the emergence of a U: Fona. 
Some of the biggest pressure towards ČTÚ went at the time of the U: Fona from T-Mobile. 
The publicly available information from the web pages ČTÚ... 
But just in case NYNÍ: Fon suits as an argument why the virtual operator to avoid. 
Martin Kemrová it said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently also umocněno entering the fourth mobile operator on the market. 
Having regard to the nature of the mobile market in the work, it is clear that the entry of another player on him and, above all, on its services placed high demands. " 
Given this approach, the mobile phone but is directly striking complete neglect of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
This is not just a position ČTÚ, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, unlike the Great Britain and other advanced countries - does not have the power to intervene in the competition. 
You belong solely by the Office for the Protection of the competition (ÚOHS). 
But for the whole of the issues he was his typical position. 
"The entry of virtual operator on the mobile market would have been possible, after the conclusion of the contract between the mobile operator and virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure. 
No such an agreement has been concluded, because of the potential candidates most likely not for the classic Operators sufficiently interesting, "he said in response to a query Christopher cottage from the department of external relations ÚOHS. 
From among the representatives of the operators as worded statement about it. 
From the office, which is to represent the interests of the consumers and, inter alia, care should be taken to ensure that nobody nezneužíval its position in the market, it is more than a daunting. 
Separately, when Christopher cottage adds: "Abroad, where the virtual operators routinely, we can see that their entry on the market has contributed to a decrease in prices for mobile phone service." 
Perhaps, but the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the decline in prices do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
In truth shocking in its case to the point of touching the interplay of three mobile operators, which results from their responses. 
The question of whether it is really just an accident, offers a completely alone. 
As well as virtually the same price of gasoline at a filling station is certainly a chance and hard compete. 
"ÚŘAD in this respect, it has no signs of the anti - competitive negotiations and, therefore, no reason in some way to intervene. 
None of the phone does not have a dominant position, therefore, is not to the increased responsibility for their negotiations on the market. 
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet and regulátorovi value, "he said in his statement cottage. 
Interpretace a dominant position in the market is one of many of the points. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared ČTÚ, according to which they are withdrawn from the point of view of competition in a single market. 
On that market, then, of course, none of the Czech operators does not have a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer another point of view - for the creation of a virtual operator need is always the consent of the network. 
And the mobile operator - has a total of logically - on its network of monopoly. 
So, in a certain segment of the necessarily dominant must be... 
But even if that argument not permitting them for ÚOHS should be at least worrying that the three mobile operators to remarkably similar. 
While complaints of a number of candidates (including the company GTS Novera) show that when dealing with all the operators rests on a very similar hurdles. 
Outsourcing liability to ČTÚ is then in telecoms relatively normal wheeze, which gives ÚOHS from the whole matter. 
We met with him in several of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, until recently adopted novels telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the area of competition in telecommunications failed to impose, while from what many experts promised to improve the situation. 
It shall representatives ÚOHS know more than good, but perhaps they are their interests elsewhere. 
It ono, when the thing even if no one is checking 
Meanwhile, without identifying the remains of a pseudovirtuálních operators, which in the Czech mobile networks are just a few. 
These are the companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, which are but the public only partially. 
Usually, the companies involved in the multilevel marketing. 
VLASTNÍ mobile telephone service it offers to Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife, and many of the other. 
Price lists of these firms are usually go only to a chosen. 
The charm of lies in the fact that the company against the authorising serves as a classic corporate customer orders a large number of SIM cards. 
As a major customer and then get the special price (and other). 
The problem is that trading conditions of all Czech mobile telephony-in similar přeprodej ban. 
"If there are cases in which you talk, it could be a violation of the terms of the contract, which we were and could result in the closure of cooperation with the company," she said in our search for this problem of Martin Kemrová. 
It is, of course, but it is unlikely that such activity to the responsible people from the mobile telephony-in nedonesla. 
In particular, in the case of the three of these companies may go to thousands of customers. 
None of the operators, such a procedure. 
From the activities of these firms are considerable profits, and, unlike the real virtual operators - they do not pose a threat to its own official marketing. 
For possible problems, says Miroslav Čepický: "The law allows such speculation, but in the service of these companies using only a tiny percentage of customers. 
Moreover, you must accept that the SIM card in their phone is led by their first name, not with her so as to make ordinary customers mobile telephony-in. " 
PRÁVĚ this, but it should be ČTÚ at least strange. 
Moreover, opens another question for ÚOHS.... 
If the mobile operators přivírají over a similar procedure eyes, why not blocking the formation of a virtual operator? 
To be supplied that ÚOHS has to reveal similar to the activities of a relatively strong powers, and, if not, they might not be content with the explanation for operators on the merits of the idea that they and their trading conditions that ban. 
When we most expensive 
As it has in the text of the times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market brought zaznamenatelný fall in prices for services. 
At the same time, in virtually all countries, where virtual operators vznikali, tried to classical operators their inception, more or less. 
They used arguments were virtually identical - too small, or too saturovaný market, the problems with the quality of the services, etc. 
In developed countries, but in these times hit the regulatory authorities, who defend the rather than the interests of the mobile operators, but their customers. 
Measures of whether the formal or informal pressure, then, that it was the first virtual operator and the nabalovali further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities the whole case přehazují like a hot potato. 
In our experience, we can't shake the feeling that ambiguity in kompetencích them in these cases, more than one. 
But the neházejme flintu to rye. 
Where are the behind-the-scenes information is correct, and the virtual operator for us, you soon discover, Czech mobile market is perhaps again rozhýbe. 
If one of the operators to create a virtual mobile operator said, it is hard to be able to remain ÚOHS was the rejection of (discrimination) the other candidates. 
And we need to we call more than in the rest of Europe.

Sudetenland wanted after the US a referendum 
The Germans did in 1945 Sudetští the integration of Šumavy to the United States. 
This is from the letter, which is stored in collections Jihočeské scientific library. 
When we cannot be part of Germany and Austria, do we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such desires are supposedly in 1945 turned some of the groups sudetských Germans on the US president. 
It is, among other things, from the letter, which was in a private archive and today it is stored in collections Jihočeské scientific library. 
The Germans from CZECH Krumlova request in a letter to the American president to not release of "šumavské župy" - occupied Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have to correct the situation, and we want to be sure that American troops are coming to the German territory rather than as utlačovatelé and enemies, but as liberators rather," wrote in a letter, signed by the words "People, which lies at the heart of the fate of Šumavy." 
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia gives allegedly sudetským the Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope to brutality, ignoring, a misunderstanding of the, oppression and slavery, begs the authors of the letter of the American president to take over Šumavou protectorate for the present as well as ever. 
"We believe that you without regard to the views of a quarter of a million people admitted this territory, some of the state of our foreign, who utiskuje and refutes the minorities and nothing, nothing quite rates to victory Spojenců," he wrote in the letter. 
The reason why they cannot sign, is reportedly fear of revenge "Czech oppressors." 
If the US president reportedly pochyboval on sentiment šumavských Germans, was enough to šumavské župě hold a referendum on whether its people want to become part of the US or live under the auspices of the United States. 
Though the text of the letter may, in today ’ s knowledge postwar history sound a little naively, according to some pamětníků usefully illustrates the expectations sudetských Germans. 
Even when the Czech Germans had at least suggests that the will to act on their expulsion from the Republic, few of them had such a possibility has admitted. 
Some had expected that the United States and Great Britain vyjednají Sudetům a kind of autonomy. 
Others believed that simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav cottage, born in the Czech Budějovicích. 
He was for the war as budějovický German inflated to the Navy to Baltu. 
When he was at the end of the war, the British and place him in the prison camp in Holštýnsku, dozens of other Czech Germans behind him over, to be taught in English. 
"They believed that, when he returned home, will be čeština them," said the cottage. 
No one from the German prisoners, wild before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not count, that will be on the basis of Benešových or be relegated from the Republic. 
You don 't - - zaplatíš! 
An emotional campaign attack on the driver

And in a pool of blood, then, is the word "zaplatíš." 
It has symbolizovat, that you may not to pay for a life of their own. 
Viewers will be Shrub "strašit" until 2010. 
The ministry is commissioned to inspire similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is commonly seen images with drastickými images of the victims of accidents. 
He promises that it will reduce nehodovost and the number of deaths on the Czech roads. 
Shrub, the agency Euro RSCG... 
Cukr and stick to the driver

The stick is the threat of fines or an accident. 
Drivers must be reminded of risk, "says traffic psychologist Hospital On Homolce Martin Kořán. 
And so are the need for information campaign in the press and mainly negative ads, says psychologist. 
JIŽ less effective, according to him, the panes, which tell the driver in danger. 
"If it is installed the static of worrying against the hazards likely soon fell with the environment and the driver to her will not attend," he said Kořán.

The questions after the accident: They are stevardi bus illegal? 
The law is not, walk in the remote bus may not 
In the context of a tragic accident bus company Student Agency near the Italian Padovy began the question of whether they can stevardi and travellers for the journey to the bus. 
"If we wanted to strictly and formally to comply with the law, business is stevarda in violation of the law on the road," says a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation Charles Hanzelka. 
The accident, at last week's demise 22 stevardka, probably caused the driver of the vehicle, which the bus crossed the road. 
Dívka at that moment, sitting next to the driver, at least a safe place in the car, although it is reserved for two other places. 
The bus may, however, crash, or of the brakes, even at a time when the Steward he leaves coffee or newspapers. 
Role plays, whether the bus is in accordance with the technical licence with points to stall. 
If it is not in the bus homologováno must passengers sit. 
The remote buses Student Agency for standing not; Aktuálně.cz confirmed and the director of the Radim Jančura. 
"This with the Ministry of this, of course, the movement of passengers'. 
Then it odvolali and we had to ensure that passengers can walk to run to the bathroom, where his chair, "he told his opinion. 
The law stevarda doesn 't 
"There is a common understanding of the legal interpretation of the role of stevarda - no legal provisions of the role does not. 
None of the legal regulation, however, neither prohibits carriers to provide services. 
The law on road transport knows only term the conductor of the vehicle; his rights and obligations does not define, "adds less clearly spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the Department of road vehicles of the Department of Transportation Joe meek, on the contrary, says that the law of treating enough. 
"It depends on whether the bus in homologaci authorised sites for stall. 
This it ends, "he says. 
Buses are divided on the city, where jobs are on hold and is limited to a maximum speed, long - distance with points on the restless with the higher the permitted speed and on the remote without jobs in places with the highest permissible speed and seats fitted with safety belts. 
As in the aircraft, says an expert 
An expert BESIP on traffic safety then Hořín in motion stevardů on board the bus, not the fundamental problem. 
"PŘI smooth driving much of the risk of recurrence, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft. 
Even here, it is not certain when it comes turbulence and the flight attendant may uhodit to the head. " 
"If, however, the bus braked sharply, of course, is the physical laws. 
As well as in the city bus and tram. 
The safety of the stevardů must address the carrier internal rules, "he says, and also, from the point of view of the law is the issue unresolved. 
It is unwilling to abolish the Jančura services 
The student Agency offers services stevardů as the sole autobusový carrier. 
There are two of them on hundreds of... 
The director, even after the accident, not their business at risk. 
"Once but resuming the impression that it is the profession stevardů risk, so it is zruším. 
The coffee and newspapers may passengers to get at the time of the attack. 
It would fall and the costs, "he says. 
As for the safety of interest in the case of the absence of stevardů in their vehicles, the director of the Asiany Alexey Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines in comparison with the SA. 
"We don 't have stevardky, we are against it from the beginning. 
Sooner or later, it would be a fatal accident, "said fewer than a year ago for Týden.cz. 
Became the enormous tragedy 
The accident summary PŘI connections to Naples perished young stevardka from Plzeňska, who had worked for the company for two years. 
The Slovenian truck probably vybočil without the use of a rudder from odstavného lane and blocked the path of the bus. 
His driver was trying to avoid a sharp,, brushing him, however, the right of the front parts. 
ŽE would have been vyprodána two seats reserved for the rest stevardů, Jančura rejects. 
"These places is not in use, and the possible reserve are blocked by." 
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck. 
Having odškodněním family girls will have to wait for the judgement of the Court, but the financial compensation is expected to and from the culprit. 
Of the law? 
In the black 
The specification of the movement of stevardů on board the bus could bring the rule of law, which over a year working třicetičlenná expert group, the Department of Transportation. 
"To any specific conclusion, however, falls. 
Buses or too, rather than the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile phone while driving, "says an expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity stevardů for something fundamentally threatened the safety of passengers," the spokesman Hanzelka to check the safety of the bus, is in the powers of the police and the offices of the safety of the work. 
Frankfurt nadějí back is 
Big words in a letter to employees of the bank's board of directors WestLB. 
The joint units of Randstads financial institutions with frankfurtskou Deka-Bank is "the central institution of the financial group of savings for trade in capital markets," he tells us, in the letter, which was given to the public on Monday. 
WestLB referred to in the letter to this transaction vnese "set of authority" to ensure the long-term returns. 
And it may be the key to providing still more economic stimulus such a connection to another by pooling in the sector of the regional banks. 
These texts are created when he wants představenstvo in problematickém period to demonstrate the ability to act. 
An unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also from the Federal Office for the supervision of financial services, whose notification of the Earth 's government in Northern Porýní-Vestfálsku that it is time to find a solution for the future, it is still fresh. 
The connection between Deka-Bank, which is known for its customers' savings and investment funds, and WestLB, whether it will be of any kind, however, is no longer a longer period of time - and on the Frankfurt side. 
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas is at the half - yearly results of management at the end of August, he said that in the event of the merger of its banking house of Mainzer Landstraße with one of the regional banks, such as, for example, with the bank Helaba or WestLB, does not make sense. 
The Board of SPRÁVNÍ Deka-Bank, for which it is one half of the banks and from the other unions savings, however, has led představenstvo talks with WestLB on the common commercial activities. 
Could you go on the shops on the capital market or their part of the world. 
The talks, however, have only just begun, observe financiers. 
The Deka-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees belong to the important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, in connection with the konsolidací in spořitelním sector to speak for the first time. 
In 2003, it appeared momentarily that could lead to a merger Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, and with the bank Helaba. 
From this the Triple Alliance at the end there was nothing. 
Shortly after the plans for a merger went to the public, followed the hesenská by the government against the participation of the bank Helaba. 
Neither of the two remaining banking houses so nespojily. 
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz Landesbank Baden-Württemberg received from Stuttgart. 
And yet, has repeatedly said speculation about the connection Deka-Bank zemskými banks. 
In recent years, however, the speculation about the connection its financial house with other expressed negative Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of the bank Helaba. 
It seems, however, that regardless of the uzrává belief that the alignment of the various bank of public sector is a necessity. 
Now, after the elections, presented to the earth in Bavaria, would be the first to start a connection BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg. 
It for Helabu is not very good news. 
Where should pressure to other mergers grow, comes to the possible partners for such a connection. 
In the south would play only the second fiddle and yet that the financial crisis has faced a significantly better than the banking houses in Munich, and in Stuttgart. 
The link with WestLB again at the beginning of the year by the Union of savings and office giro banks Hessen-Thüringen, who is in Helabě pětaosmdesátiprocentní share. 
In the account would be the most Nord LB. 
Geo - strategic considerations of this type are but only one side of the problem. 
On the other hand, it is a question of how much together tarmac business models of individual institutions. 
In June, Merl, has said that the critical question of how business model should be ensured the future competitiveness of regional banks, the German association of savings and office giro banks yet nezodpověděl. 
Everything would also could end up with the distribution of WestLB, which in this institution, of course, no one wants. 
It is also in a letter to its board of directors are talking about the fact that seeks to "a comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house. 
Whether, and how it will be possible to bring the components with linking them with Deka-Bank, shows the time. 
Weekend DRUHÝ Oktoberfestu is known as the "weekend with the Italians."

In the middle of the night, through the day between the stalls, with a beer in 22.30 exit back. 
Overnight stays would only unnecessary costs, says Marco. 
The path is 75 euros, including uvítacího toast with Kaiser, uvařeným bavorského strictly according to the law of beer, health insurance, and the German - speaking guide - Marco went in Frankfurt on language course. 
Buses along in the middle of the night, after autostrádě direction to "Brennero." 
Beer of the crash, not yet. 
The bus quickly umlká, passengers slept. 
Well, its forces still will need. 
Built in Brixenu and Holzkirchenu, where on Interstate 8 bit before Mnichovem is yet another break and lots of other buses with the Italian identity mark. 
When Marcova group, in accordance with the plan, at 7: 30 in the morning, comes to the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there has been about 50 other buses from across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and others are to be collected, Marco is the latest manifestation of a, explains the plan of attack. 
First: Put on the yellow čepičku... 
It is to the left of the švabachem written "Oktoberfest," in addition to the Internet address Marcovy travel: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it." 
Zadruhé: "When they opened the door to the pivního tent, run!" Calls Marco into the morning air. 
"Go!" And obsaďte space in the rear of the tent. 
"No, you don 'nepřekáželi, and not all of the yellow cap on the same bench, the mixture evenly after the space!" 
Máz stands 8 euros, 25 cents. 
And remember to the tips. 
"Sekuriťákům show that, to the contrary. 
As soon as you leave their jobs are gone! " 
Third: "Tonight at 10: 30 be back here!" You? 
And up at Wiesn, an area with pivními tents. 
By way of one member of the group navěšuje yellow cap as a mark on the trees, a sign, and even to the election poster of one large Bavarian parties. 
It is necessary to prepare for the retreat.

Sleepless night for the lender Hypo Real Estate 
JEŠTĚ last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable. 
Well, that the policies used the word "relatively" and to his claim in the fact that the German banking sector will be a crisis of the development of the orphanage. 
As one of the previous weekend. 
The Dax index of financial house specializing in the financing of real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) gets from a consortium of German banks, credit in the amount of a few billion to protect against turbulencemi on the markets. 
A person of wanton inhumanity against ourselves on Monday said the agency Reuters, said the credit assistance will go up to 35 billion euros. 
Interest rates will have to Hypo Real Estate (HRE) to pay only from really exhausted. 
The money had come from the private and public banks. 
In the background are the loss of a subsidiary Depfa... 
The state-owned financier, according to newspaper reports on long-term projects, which lent money, extremely short refinancoval, which now because of distrust in the markets is not possible. 
In the first half of 2008, the reserve bank has dwindled to 95% to 2.37 million euros, and slightly decreased and share their own capital from 1.6 to 1, 45 percent. 
Ordinary income and net income on financial transactions, compared to minulému year dropped to zero, the income of the increased value of claims and of certain securities and also from the abolition of the reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent of the 5 million euros. 
Just because of higher yields of refunds for subsequent accounting charges for the restructuring of the former group Depfa, and of the refund of interest under the tax law and under the mediation of trade for koncernové firms was šestnáctiprocentní decline on the part of the proceeds more moderate. 
The former state-owned financier, following its privatization in 1990, burned on mortgages for živnostníky, which then were from the portfolio of services provided and maintained Aareal Bank. 
Because in a state funding for the vydělávalo too little, involved then Depfa more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of the common projects, private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally, diverzifikovala. 
From the value of its subsidiaries must now Hypo Real Estate something to her, and these write-offs will have "a tangible effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have vaguely heard. 
The fact is that the dividend will not. 
Now for the year 2007 was reduced by two thirds. 
Hypo Real Estate is from the takeover of Depfa major finančníkem state and infrastructure projects. 
More than any other institutions depends on the refinancing to mezibankovním market, because it does not have any deposits by customers. 
After the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers before two weeks ago, virtually vyschl source of inter - bank credit, because banks had guarded, liquidity. 
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of the credit portfolio Depfa - around $50 billion euro - short-term funds to refinance. 
According to the communication of Hypo Real Estate, the financial need for a group of the credit for dohlednou period covered and the company is protected "from the influence of the international money markets are largely incapable." 
Other sources were to hear that the money is to ensure that the refinancing by the end of 2009. 
The chairman of the board of directors HRE Georg FUNKE, on the contrary, he said that the group of Hypo Real Estate Group in the foreseeable future there will be no need to use the money markets. 
SPOLKOVÁ Bank and the National Federation of the Institute for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the group of Hypo Real Estate on the market, it is now. 
In this hope the shareholders and creditors of the Bank. 
But with regard to the dynamism and nepostižitelnost crisis is likely to be there is no security. 
Indeed, it is not entirely out of the question that the loan was to be completely run out. 
Not, however, ruled out, or the opposite. 
After the bank on Sunday, too late in the afternoon, presumably, stood before insolvencí cannot, though preliminary, saving two passions. 
The rate of the shares fell 75 percent to 3, 30 euros. 
On the contrary, as well as the rates bonds. 
While the preferential debts are virtually nepohnuly lose, rates of secondary bonds significantly. 
This is especially TÝKÁ bonds of the former subsidiaries Württemberg Hypo and logically securities with a maturity after 2009. 
Bonds Hypo-Real-Estate originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be after výrazném hardening of the banking crisis and a crisis of the Institute of itself, which the companies have brought over Depfa, understand depending on the stability of the international financial system. 
As long as the issue of the Bank, governments and less affected by the commercial banks are unwilling to support the system, it is possible to reckon with the payment securities in their repayment terms. 
But it may also be the case in what is now almost no one dares to hope - in the next 15 months, will be overcome with the financial crisis. 
But given the reports coming at the same time with this partial zestátněním from the likelihood of bordering the certainty now has become a sense of hope. 
This is especially long lenders are likely to prepare a series of probdělých nights, when they will have to decide whether their commitments to give up. 
Short-term investors may limit the use of at least to create a transfer of the losses from the previous financial year on foreign exchange gains later years for the purpose of the future of the payment of taxes on capital gains. 
Sylvana bento box and the secret 
When he was 16 - year - old self Sylvana Hiltropová on the first day of high school in Tačibaně imagine, Girls pochichtávat: The German is completely "kawaii"! 
What this means? 
Sylvana this word knows from mang. On his new blog on výměnném stay tells of Japan. 
"The first day in Japan. 
Sir, I was nervous. 
Already on the way to school I became. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of the Kawasaki and I 40 minutes by train to the middle in Tačibaně. 
The way I had to find itself, fortunately, I was lost. 
That seems to be the beginning of the study to Tačibaně is not meant to be so tightly, as in the case of us at home in Lower Saxony. 
The students will come together after the eighth hour and twenty minutes before nine starts with a short sitting with the teacher, the so-called 'Home Room.' 
But even before it began teaching, I should imagine. 
JÁ, I am not the type of person who likes to talk to people, let alone in front of the class of 40 students. 
Because I still had the school uniform, I took on the old skirt their host mother, the jacket, blue socks and a pair of black leather boots. 
Thus ustrojená so I stood in front of the bench and tried to all right to say: 'Sajónara wo še Sylvana...' my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and for the week my birthday. 
In that moment, I was very glad that I had the language began to teach for two years. 
All 31 holek in class had šuškalo, chichotalo and mávalo and I still hear the word 'kawaii'. 
What I already knew from their mang.... 
It belongs to the verbal reserve of Japanese girls are necessary for survival and means' charming, sweet '. 
And then I quickly into the place. 
A girl next to me is enough of a reason for the honor of being beside her sat foreign student. 
The rest of the hour was relatively calm, but when a gong, literally rained down on me. 
Only one over the other and anticipation, and flew with me on the possible even impossible - and in doing so, it is really hard to understand Japan's English. 
During a break, then everyone was unwrapped their benta... 
My host mother and I, too, have done such a box at dinner - and this is something other than the dull German snacks. 
Should I rice with herbs, a small párečky, salad from the cucumbers and seaweed, fruit and a kind of fish in the tofu těstíčku. 
The majority of all netuším exactly what here in Japan. 
Those things look and taste quite newly. 
Some of it is that everything is good. 
No, perhaps on slano laden with plums, br! 
Benta on Japanese schools are not only the dinner. 
Sometimes it happens, will give the kid the boy had prepared bento, which in this case is particularly umělecky adjusted, and hopes that the boy at tea on the break, closer. 
I read about it in their manga komiksech... 
My curiosity, if it here, too. 
'Why not just Japan?' Flew to me, my friends, when I told them that I want to go to school year in Tokyo. 
Then JÁ always said: 
'Because I simply fascinated by it.' 
Koneckonců for years like reading manga. 
And to these comic and their culture better understood, I began with a little to learn Japanese. 
It was, I was absolutely clear that one day I will have to come. 
Because I 've a weakness for tradition, customs and practices. 
And there are high ceněny.... 
On the one hand, Japan is in the countries of the latest technology and trends, on the other, is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And since it is all so well organized, I never felt there was lost, even when it is the biggest city of Tokyo, as I have ever seen. " 
The rats have feelings of 
When a rat or a juryman; goes against the hazards, this means that also feel fear? 
Neurologist Joseph le Doux is convinced that even many animals have feelings. 
But how it would be possible to verify whether the feel the same, when they behave like us? 
In the Internet journal "edge" for a few years, be published contributions known to scientists. 
Spiegel Online in its series is the answer to the question "What you as true, without you could do it?" 
I believe that the animals have feelings and the other states of consciousness, without it I or anyone else ever could prove if we can prove that the knowledge to other people. 
But in this case, at least we can hope, because all human brains to agree on a basic configuration. 
But as soon as we pay attention to another type and pick up a question of perception, or a general sense, we are entering the neschůdného terrain, because the hardware is not. 
When the rat is in danger, he would do the same, what many of the other animals: To pretend that it is dead, reinforced or attack. 
People behave similarly, of which some scientists deduce on a comparable subjective experience. 
I, however, I do not believe in it. 
Two aspects of the brain structures znesnadňují delegation of our subjective experience on the experience of the animals. 
This is partly because of the associated with human knowledge almost always include the lateral prefrontal kortex (because of its share in the short term memory and vykonávacích or management positions). 
Such a large area is humans are significantly more than other primates, and it seems that, in the case of other creatures, entirely missing. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontálním cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that the man is even from other primates. 
Another dramatic oddity could hide the principle of the man: Because it is so much of his perception of the associated with language, he says, are often that knowledge on the subject. 
In this case, we might be able to animals. 
But even if the knowledge of the language doesn't matter, of course, the language of influence, so that the animal awareness, whether it is zkonstruované, however, it is likely that distinguishes them from the majority of states of consciousness of our. 
Therefore, it is difficult to see how it looks consciousness for other animals. 
If, as some of the internal and subjective, nor does it measure nor, for the sake of a special hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience that puts us in his examination before the big problems. 
Most of my connection is related to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is yet another aspect of consciousness, which should be scientifically easily accessible. 
It would be possible to processes in the consciousness of the animals to investigate, irrespective of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in the studies of short-term memory for primates, especially on the example of visualization. 
But this approach, which gave Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is focused more on the neural koreláty, than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical, but also are not. 
Interestingly, this approach emphasizes the importance of nefrontálního for the implementation of the visual cortex. 
What this means for the feelings? 
JÁ is vyvozuji of emotional system, as is the fear system, it is activated in the brain vědomém its own activities. 
What he refers to as the "fear", so it is mental state in which we are, when the defense system lokalizovaného activity in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reaction) will make use of the operational memory. 
From this angle, there are feelings of closely connected with those areas of the cortex, which are primates, and especially the people. 
In connection with the linguistic nature is fine graduation perception, because using words and grammar - we can distinguish and kategorizovat stocks to be attributed to themselves and others. 
By contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings arise from the simpler activity in the areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to personal feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, who are, however, more focused on the brain stem. 
Because of this network, in the course of human evolution, too, could still participate in the sensations vnímaných many animal families. 
Plain in theory, it failed to oppose, but what I believe to be the unprovable. 
Pankseep argues that what we in rats and humans appears to fear, is likely to be both organism as well: How, but it is impossible to verify, says further Pankseep, whether the rats and people feel the same, when a similarly behave? 
A juryman; against the risks related - feeling he also fear? 
From my point of view, it is not just the resemblance to the behavior of demonstrate compliance experience. 
It is true that the neural comparison us moves: Rats and people have similar brain cells, by contrast, cockroaches and the brain. 
But it is for the feelings of the brain stem? 
And even if it can be demonstrated in humans: How can we wanted to demonstrate that in the case of the rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings. 
But really, I don 't know how I do it. 
And because of their feelings are likely to be substantially different from those of our (because of human consciousness, is on the special districts and the language), studying emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of the rats. 
Indeed, in this case, we can see progress on the neural level, as in the case of rats, and for the people we measured the same. 
As in the case of the rats nezkoumám language and consciousness, nezkoumám or feelings, after all, 'I don' t know whether there are. 
It is possible that is considered a shortsighted, but rather on forward, than to have it against the wall. 
I a practical emocionalista....

Dark matter affects the years of space sond 
For years, scientists don ’ t know the board with one of a mysterious phenomenon: Dark matter affects the speed of space sond during the so-called manoeuvre swing-by (gravitational prak). 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein College of Medicine might not be entirely correct. 
For nearly 18 years flew space probe "Ulysses" through space. 
Because of the fuel line, which soon zamrznou, it now threatens to death of cold. 
Among scientists for years of a mysterious phenomenon is a mess - anomalies gravitačního praku. 
It is a mere prak manoeuvre space sond, in which receive additional momentum in center field, a space of the body, such as the Earth. 
Thanks to the probe may save a lot of fuel. 
The research Evropsko-americká Cassini-Huygens probe used of the physical task, as well as solar probe Ulysses. 
But it is what the scientists for years in this case in surprise: Our body is not 100 percent, so how could this man in the good old gravitačního law. 
On the contrary, there are nepravidelnostem in speed. 
The probe unexpectedly zrychlují or slowing down. 
So far, physicians failed to this effect. 
Named him anomalies gravitačního praku.... 
Some experts fear that it might even the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which describes the attractiveness of mass zakřivením space might not be entirely correct. 
The US physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein was right, and trying to explain the abnormality gravitačního praku using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in space, astronomers have found. 
"ODPOVĚDNOU for this abnormality could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes. 
On the existence of dark matter know vesmírní researchers only about ten years. 
On the basis of her evidently gravitational force, whose effect on other space of the body can be observed. 
She herself, on the other hand, is entirely invisible, which means that nevysílá nor does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, nor visible light. 
According to the calculations, the scientists from that dark matter, a fifth of the mass of the universe.

The abuse of otčímem "led to the suicide of a" 
Several years of abuse of otčímem led his wife to be killed, came before the court. 
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, was 57 Michael Trerise from Stithiansu in Cornwall was sentenced to six years. 
In the present Crown Court heard that his own daughter Stephanie Randleovou regularly female, when she was between five and seven years ago. 
"Cítím is responsible for her death," he wrote Trerise in the confessions. 
The court was also told that Miss Randleová killed in their home in the Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34 years. 
When, as a child lived in closer, Trerise female obliging her and her eyes, and her sexually always, while her mother worked in a pub. 
Trerise he and his wife divorced in the 1980's, and returned to Cornwall. 
His own daughter went to Plymouth.. 
But before the court said that Miss Randleovou, who spent the bulk of his time as a volunteer for the organisation of the National Trust, the specter of abuse, which has done it twice in a week. 
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife in court, said that in 2006, said friends of Miss Randleové, which is also very devoted surfování and cycling, that it was "emotionally dead," and that 'renunciation of life. " 
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found dead in her apartment in Plymouth. 
It is considered that udusila a plastic bag. 
Randle nevlastnímu stood face to face with the father of her daughter, who wrote the confessions, who wore on the words: "I am female and binding her eyes. 
"Nezneužíval I... 
Cítím responsible for her death. " 
Judge Christopher Elwen Trerisovi said: "You are extremely strange fetišista and for your sacrifice it had to be horrible, when she had to do was just seven years. 
"This uneasy the story ends by saying that he was the victim of married life. 
Much more dreadful JEŠTĚ is the fact that, if it were to do so, the matter would most likely never got to the court. " 
"In particular, I would like to emphasize the consequences which, in accordance with the Stephaniiných parents your crime on their daughter over the years," he said. 
"Obviously otherwise would most likely was a powerful, successful and happy young woman." 
The official, who lost the data will be accused of 
The BBC learned that a government official, who left in June of top secret documents on a train, will be charged under the law on the state secrets. 
The man left the two top secret documents on a train at Waterloo, at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense. 
The documents, before they were handed over to the police, fell into the hands of the BBC. 
This is at least compelling an offense against the said the law, and there is no sign criminal intent. 
The BBC for the defence affairs correspondent Frank Gardner said that such a move will be, for many, in Whitehallu surprising. 
"Probably thought that the matter internally as well as between the Ministry and the Office of the government," he said. 
The staff member, who cannot be named, is accused in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the rule of law, which is the clause, which deals with the protection of information. 
Crown prosecutor told the Metropolitan Police officer indict on the basis of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the common News (of the Joint Intelligence Committee, the Committee).

The government has for the protection of the deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds. 
The interest of the loan will pay all of the firms that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative loans. 
The Director General of the Association of the cooperative loans (BSA), Adrian Coles said that it was "humbling" that záložny and their members must pay for it. 
Čtrnáctimiliardový debt will eventually paid by the fact that will be rescued mortgages Bradford & Bingley. 
But the interest, which is in the meantime nastřádá, each year to repay all 700 of the financial firms that have taken client deposits. 
The compensation plan of services for the BBC confirmed that all 59 of the cooperative loans, is in this započteno. 
It is humiliating that these institutions, which are behaving in... must now pay some of the bills for those institutions, which have not been nearly as levelheaded 
Adrian Coles, the BSA 
He said that each company is paying proportionately to close to her, and that záložny from that they have to pay about 18% of the price. 
The Treasury Department estimates that the interest on the debt increase by the amount in 2009 to 450 million pounds. 
This means that záložny will have to find £81 million to splatily interest from the first of the year. 
Adrian Coles, director of the trade association of the cooperative loans, told the BBC that he is convinced that it is not fair. 
"It is humiliating, that those institutions which during the boom of the housing market behaving in must now pay some of the bills for those institutions, which nearly as reasonable." 
According to the BSA no záložna since 1945, when it emerged, falls. 
"We need to during the next few weeks to examine all aspects of this matter, we saw, what are the options to protect the cooperative záložny and their members before the bill, which would be substantial," said Cole. 
The interest due in 2009, covers seven months from the end of the year to the end of March. 
In the year 2010 will be to repay the interest for the whole year, and this could be almost twice as much. 
Whereas the cooperative záložny are common organisation without shareholders, this bill will eventually pay for their members through higher taxes or lower interest rates on their accounts.

For Bangladesh expremiérku refused bail 
Bangladéšský court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Šajch Hasíny Vadžídové for release on bail, which means that if they return to their homeland, can be arrested. 
JEJÍ lawyers said that the court had refused to release on bail in connection with accusations that blackmail received from some entrepreneurs over fifty million Taka (729 700 dollars) when she was prime minister.

The report by the inspector to Gonzales' role in the affair was expressing a very critical, saying that rests with the "major responsibility" for the release, "abdikoval" from its leading position and, in the process, "remarkably neangažoval." 
Other officials, including former high - the Bush adviser Karl Rovea were kritizováni considered that, when the investigation did not cooperate. 
Will be Meat Loafovo enormity services 
Rocková star Meat Loaf on the piano is one of the prices of the Q Awards for his epickou anthem Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who had to its special gold price comes to the recent next weekend in London, said that he was "honoured" gained recognition. 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, it was the title track Meat Loafova hitového album of the year in 1977. 
Nominations for this year is leading the band Coldplay, which is to connect the selection came in four categories. 
Paul Rees, the chief editor of Q, said: "There are certain songs, which stands over such things as time and genre, and the Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them." 
The song, written by Jim Steinmanem, needed a big vocals, which gave Meat Loaf on the piano. 
She was instrumental parts, which lasted nearly two minutes. 
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and more than on the fifteenth place. 
But the Meat Loafovo album Bat Out Of Hell in the rankings, was around nine years old and has sold around the world for more than 40 million copies. 
Meat Loaf on the piano - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered health problems in recent years, in 2003, but because of irregular srdečnímu rhythm, after the stage collapsed. 
In 2007, he was forced to cancel an acute laryngitida concerts. 
It was later revealed that he had the hlasivkách tests. 
Obskurní streets, often sleeping, and perhaps soon on the sale 
The city of New York has thousands of roads, the streets, highways and other road, some of the famous, the only other commercial. 
But even many taxíkářů-veteránů and longstanding local has difficulties when they have to find extra Place, mostly because it had never heard. 
This tiny alley is in the East Village and leads to the north of the First Street - without the Druhou street - between the Bowery and Druhou Avenue. 
About ten PŘI width and length of the 40 metres rather resembles zaprášený pass than transport move. 
Are there any sign of the names of the streets. 
In the current satins is virtually invisible. 
Yet, however, has the admirer. 
For example, the name of Avalon Bay, developera recently built luxury buildings on the street. 
It wants extra Place in the newly paved and create a cleaner way to business and butikům, which in new buildings are open. 
Other obdivovateli are long-term neighbors who say that they were short alley okouzleni, simply because it was one of the last vestiges of the time, than he was to block zušlechtěn. 
But the city of the Office for the protection and development of the home, which has a street in its power, does not have the slightest interest in her. 
At a meeting of the land of the Committee of the village community načrtli representatives of local magistracy and firms Avalon Bay plan, under which should developer street to buy. 
But according to Suzan Stetzerové, obvodní female managers of the village of the Community (3), the Committee favors a variant, when street will remain in the hands of the city, and I asked about the new plan, which should be submitted to the next month. 
"The city has its own only very few of the land, and we would like to Extra Place in his ownership of the left," she said. 
"They could be submitted proposals to repair and management, which could make the Avalon, but also want to ensure public accessibility." 
Avalon Bay before a few months ago has announced that he wants a small Street and the newly paved with seating, which would be used in a cafe, whose interest in rented space developer expected. 
The idea that the Avalon Bay could buy the street, it was first published at a meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, spokesman for the Avalon Bay, said that, although the company wants to the street, not necessarily her own. 
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is going to fix this zpustlou back and make it a good place for the public," she said, and added that the proposed sale, the city. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Office for the maintenance of the home, said that the city really wanted to sell the house, and he said that his office, the task is to develop the property, rather than the rule. 
In comparison with its barvitějším neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place left in the history of shallow footprint. 
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when she was a large farm Philip Minthorna divided among several of his children and on the narrow strip of the country had never been done before. 
The Extra Place led the back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, and the path is perhaps best known as the background of a photo on the cover of the album the band Ramones' Rocket that Russia ". 
"This place was fantastic," says Danny Fields, general manager of the Ramones who in November 1976 photo did. 
"It was full of garbage, roztrhaného clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and rope." 
Some local, including bloggers has been, who wrote about the processing of the East Village, is opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, and argue that the piece of public property, even by meager, should the public to stay. 
Others consider Extra Place for raritu - almost unchanged at a distance of the city, which should be left as it is. 
Jeremiah Moss, who writes the blog on behalf of the disappearing Jeremiášův New York (: "Book laments: Bitterly a nostalgic view of the city, in the process, the extinction of"), posted a part of the story of the Extra Place from the headings consider city, which appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a blind alley, a dark, even in the daytime, and bordered by guarded by rusty iron iron gates stores and zatlučenými windows, where in ditches about a week old newspapers." 
With only a few exceptions, was the one recent evening, just as. 
The rat took place through the end of the street near the door, which led to the CBGB, in which the site is now trade in expensive clothes. 
There was the graffiti on the walls and, in addition to the fresh batch of zahozených newspaper was an empty bottle of beer. 
Few passers said that the extra Place thinks rarely, but has suggested that he would be a boost to could come in handy. 
By contrast, Fields said that they thought that some people underestimate the trust of the dead in its current state. 
"NEJLEPŠÍ years of my life," he said, "have been on the sites of the dark, wet and ugly." 
The debate about bilingvalitě: Immersion in the English 
In this issue in the focus on education will be, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to bilingvnímu education. 
Lance T. Izumi, academic worker from kalifornistiky and director of education in the organization of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co - author of "worse than you think: Why did the middle class needs to choose schools". 
An appeal to Hispanic voters is a very insidious process matter. 
Education agenda of Barack Obama just shows the.... 
Obama's campaign points out that "afro-američtí and Hispanic students are significantly less likely that dostudují than white students," which is true. 
In order to be with their performance differences in the battle for Obama's educational agenda in particular, inter alia, "a transitional dvojjazyčné education" for those who have yet to learn English. 
The question in the case of Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingvnímu training, which emphasizes that class used in languages other than English, is stronger than his interest in reducing the performance differences. 
Consider, for example, sixth Street Prep, charter elementary school in Los Angeles County east of. 
Students of the schools are in most cases of Hispanics from low-income families. 
VÍCE than a third of the students, many of whom came only recently, only to learn English. 
And yet, in the state test scores of mathematics in 2008 on the highest level of an astounding $100 percent of students in four stress-filled classes. 
Almost equally fascinating ninety three percent of students in four stress-filled classes was at the highest level in the state test scores of English language and literature. 
This one success was achieved by any other method, which prefers Obama. 
Sixth Street underscores the control and training, the assessment of the capabilities of and access without excuses. 
In addition, and it would be Obama should note, according to Linda Mikelsové, director of sixth Street, pedagogical approach to the school for those who have yet to learn English, "full immersion." 
Immersion into English emphasizes almost the sole use of the English language in the classroom. 
Miss Mikelsová, which is against bilingvnímu education, told me: "We had a huge success with an entirely new pupil from Mexico - after 12 months if you went to class and they, which it is." 
"This works," she said, "for us, it works." 
Vzal would want Obama as the sixth Street Prep School as a model of how it should look like other schools with large shares of having made significant inroads among Hispanic and English is učících pupils? 
The results, which the school, should be part of the answer to this question is taken for granted, but the educational agenda of his own party (the National Educational Association is a long-time advocate of dvojjazyčného education) and his own consistent support dvojjazyčného education znejasňují predicting Obama answers. 
While Obama has agreed that migrants should learn English, recently thing trivializoval when he said that people should stop to worry about with "only should" laws. 
Instead, "you should ensure that your children were in Spanish," he said. 
If Obama truly wants to delete the performance differences should instead of educational models, which works, carefully to think before they gloat at and trivializovat is. 
Ropa rapidly falling because of renewed economic concerns, 
On Monday, oil prices fall sharply due to fears that a U.S. plan to rescue the financial markets would not need to revive the economy. 
Forward transactions with the price of crude oil fell in morning trading on the New York commodities Exchange until about 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. 
Since last Monday prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel. 
In the past two weeks with the commodities markets were shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching the peak 145,29 dollars a barrel in July fell earlier this month, the price of almost up to 90 dollars a barrel, then, have jumped on the wave of the huge uncertainty in financial markets. 
Again she is anxious investors on Monday, even after the Congress, announced that on the weekend reached agreement on the largest rescue plan in history. 
This report was zastíněna fresh concerns that the financial crisis has until the end of the far. 
In the latest episode of the degradation of the government announced that the purchase of a group of Citigroup and Wachovia Corporation, the banking section of the company. 
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially zestátnily European financial konglomerát Fortis. 
The company ’ s analysts at Barclays Capital said that Zběsilá víkendová negotiations that led to the plan to rescue the economy, "the show as incompetent to revive the mood in the market." 
As the economic situation worsens, it is expected that the demand for commodities, including oil, falls. 
"The outlook for the markets with global stocks, interest rates, and exchange rates heavily znejistěly," wrote analysts from Deutsche Bank, in a report to investors. 
"I believe that the commodity will not be able to the disease to escape. 
From the commodity perspective, it is our biggest concern, the extent to which the virus has spread to the rest of the world, and especially in China. " 
Analysts that banks cut their expectations for the next year, since oil consumption fell due to pomalejšímu growth of the economy, and lowered its predictions of the price of petrol at the 2009 of about 20%. 
The wild ride in the second quarter reached a record of the 
After he spent in uniform Jets over the past eight seasons, more than anyone else, a defensive player Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything. 
Then on Sunday, watching developments in the second quarter, in which Jets bezbodovou turned the game in spanilou journey. 
"I have never seen such a thing," said Ellis. 
The second quarter began after the Jets and arizonští Cardinals by a game discounter pošmourným below us. 
And then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Colese on dvanáctiyardový touchdownový sprint, thereby perfectly předznamenal afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile ahead. 
Favre sent Colese in this quarter for two other touchdowny, including, in which he fell cornerback, and a further 10 seconds before half the battle. 
"There was nothing extraordinary," said Favre on all their přihrávkách Colesovi... 
"It is hell 'player.... 
Komunikovalo us good, no matter what people may think. " 
While you throw Favre and Coles, the defense napadala quarterbacka Cardinals Kurt Warnera. 
Cornerback Darelle Revis snagged zbloudilý throw and returned him to 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith vytipoval other high and he caught her. 
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warnera to fumblu.... 
The loss of the ball, the fumble, which forced Bowens, was perhaps the best. 
The Cardinals came to scream, 10 seconds before the end, then, what Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked dvacetiyardový gól from the field, and a 34-0 lead. 
This is the most ever Jets gained in one quarter. 
Coach Eric Mangini Jets when he was invited to this madness, said: "In the second quarter, or a third quarter of?" 
When he was told that both - Jets were in the third quarter of 21 points without reply - Mangini said: "I can tell you that, in the second quarter of I have much more than a third. 
, many of the points in a short period of time. " 
Gebreselassie odpočatý improvements by his world record 
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why he had many considered to be the best distance runner at all, when in Sunday berlínském Marathon has his own world record and became the first person, he ran 26, 2 miles long race in two hours, four minutes. 
A victory on a nice flat line in a time of 2: 03: 59 převálcoval about 27 seconds of their previous time of 2: 04: 26, which he ran in the last year in Berlin. 
Gebreselassie, who is 35, created the 26 world record with his own career, which is really a large - ’ s world record, or at least the world champion at all distances from the metric mile after maratón. 
Last month, Gebreselassie he missed an Olympic maratón in Beijing, because he was afraid - from the rear - view, perhaps too vyplašeně - that air pollution rozdráždí his problems with asthma. 
Instead, he said, that will run in Berlin. 
In the nearly perfektních conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in goal - won on Sunday Gebreselassie bleskurychlým with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds a mile. 
What is the traťoví runners as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer lines, fell maratónský record in the last decade by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in a time of 2: 06: 05 in 1998. 
After Sunday's victory said Gebreselassie journalists that he was two weeks ago cramps in lýtku and he missed a week of practice. 
The break was clearly rather than pozdržela nabudila.... 
"I am so happy," said Gebreselassie to reporters. 
"VŠECHNO was perfect," she said. 
Last week I began PŘED again, and I was now in doubt, but everything was okay. " 
He also criticized - mainly in Kenya, východoafrickém rivalovi Ethiopia - because it is overly planned their plants, in general, the world ’ s maratónským špičkám, relied on the conductor, as if it was a race at the track, and he world records over the sense of competition. 
But this criticism may be hard to reduce Gebreselassieho huge track of quality. 
He kept pace of four Keňany Gebreselassie half in a time of 1: 02: 04. 
After the conductor odpadli, constantly Gebreselassieho recorded two Kenya's elite runners James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi. 
A little less than three miles from the Gebreselassie last absorbed and fled Kwambaiovi, who then ran to second place in a time of 2: 05: 36 and improve their personal best of almost five minutes. 
Kamathi finished third in a time of 2: 07: 48. 
In the race for women culminated in a good year in the history of the seventh fastest time of 2: 19: 19 Irina Mikitěnková, rodačka from Kazakhstan, which is now občankou Germany. 
Record time of 2: 15: 25 by Paul Radcliffová from Great Britain. 
36 - year - old Mikitěnková surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon in a time of 2: 24: 14. 
The game drew pekingské because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third Marathon, which she ran, improved his personal best of almost five minutes. 
She ran the race cleverly and deliberately: She had run four etiopských and keňských běžkyň into a building, and then, after about 18 ½ at dotáhla. 
Askale Tafa Magarsaová from Ethiopia reached the second in 2: 21: 31 and Helene Kipropová of Kenya was third in 2: 25: 01. 
Pride and the obstacles in the way of life of blacks in a separate city. 
Grasped between rozlezlými zábavními parks greater Orlando, a few miles from all the glossy, noisy and obrovitého, lie quiet city in which revived pride and the complexity of the afroamerického life. 
Eatonville, the first completely black, the city, which was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurstonová spent his childhood, is no longer so simple as described in 1935: "The city of the five lakes, three kroketových children, three hundred brown skin, three hundred good sailors, enough kvajávy, two schools and no prison." 
It is the NYNÍ site. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to an annual festival eatonvillský Zora! To the Miss Clubbers Hurstonové, the most famous female spisovatelce harlemské Renaissance. 
The city, which described the remains of the party, even if it has halted for tourists, he decided to off the tourist guide created by the Federal Writers from the period of economic crisis. 
It is still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the 1930s, when Hurstonová wrote that rural blacks in Florida often must and nesdíleli their real feelings with white man who "we know so little that she did not know what it is." 
Even now, in the course of the year, when challenged presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of rasách, many of the residents remain cautious about their foreign. 
"Dáváme ridges on how our story says," says 59letá Hortense Jones, who live since birth and is a member of the parish in the city. 
"MUSÍ it be true." 
Eatonville has long been characterized as the paradox of triumph and trouble. 
This is how the historic model of a black the emergence of a community of nearly 400 people with a poverty rate double compared to the large scale of the average. 
It is the centre of literature, but also the oaks stíněným example of Southern rural Black culture - sometimes opovrhované, sometimes vychvalované - which emerged from an American slavery. 
NENÍ too surprising that local residents are as proud as ochranářští... 
And worried about the idea of Eatonvillu really began to Zorou, which is the only way here Hurstonové says. 
She introduced the world to his hometown through the cheery books full of jargon as "Mules and Men (mules and men)" (1935) and "their Their Eyes Were watching God (eyes followed God)" (1937). 
Five paragraphs off the tourist guide to the city has changed a little to the side of the road No. 17, which leads through often pomíjené center of Florida, at the stage Black History and human drama. 
Having razancí great in life and literature introduced Hurstonová readers to trade the first eatonvillského Mayor Joe Clark, and then turned into a osobnějších jobs. 
"In addition to the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white cut picked out in a modern National School with a well kept courts and the pitch, which is always the old Howard Miller, even when you are the power to read or write." 
They also said the new husband widows Dashové and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds, and anything pasuje within an hour of the hotel." 
So, in just a few hundreds of words propojila Hurstonová Eatonville, Authority, but also with the illiteracy, znovuuzavíraním marriages and sex. 
This was clearly not a typical publishing Fodor 's. 
In fact, it was a portrait, which would all did. 
"Zora said it, as it was," says devadesátiletá Ella Dinkinsová, one of the chorus Johnsonova girls, which made nesmrtelnými Hurstonová, cited the man who, for their beauty of a special constable tunes. 
"Some people didn 't like that," she said. 
The Hurstonovou is still recalls as čipernou výstřednici, which are often went after her family moved to the state of Florida, Jacksonville.... 
Sedmasedmdesátiletý Augustus the Fool Franklin recalls that the majority, when the city přiřítila, arrived unannounced assemble in vast Chevrolet, smoking and wear trousers in the city, which is also now proud of a dress. 
But the majority of the population was fascinated, said Franklin, but many shouting. 
"The people zoru always want to see," said Franklin. 
But, he added, where, dangling by a chair on the terrace overlooking the lake Sabelia, where it was Hurstonová most likely baptised on, "never was too long." 
When Hurstonová 1960 died were poor and her books have been dropped from the press. 
It seemed to her Eatonville, together with the rest of the world had forgotten. 
PŘESTOŽE was once literary star, současnicí Langston Hughes and the only černoškou at Barnard College in the 1920s of the 20th century, was buried in an unmarked pit in Fla., Fort Pierce, where he had lived. 
In Eatonvillu there were no more mourning rituals or large public reading. 
"I think that even its importance for the rest of the world, and its legacy generally did not understand," said Valerie Boydová, author of a biography of Hurstonové "Wrapped In Rainbows (packed in duhách) issued in 2003. 
The change came in the 1980's, the 20th century. 
The leaders of the Orange County to squeeze through the city pětiproudou highway instead of the Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local dvouproudá main roads. 
Orlando already Rozlézání protlačilo Interstate Highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city. 
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville still receives from a complex historical period. 
Forced integration, together with other things, ended the relatively idylickou isolation of this community. 
In the 1950s, the battle for stirring up racial hatred on the threshold of a community. 
"At that time, the crew of white boys, they come and denounce oranges and things to people who were on the side," said Franklin. 
"In fact, we have had one lady, which kill. 
Throwing from the car melon. " 
In a letter to the journal The Orlando Article from 1955 contested Hurstonová requirement for the Supreme Court to the forced integration and of its decision in the case of Brown against the house for training, she claimed that it is "for my race offensive rather than glorify." 
People now says that desegregace schools, even when she was in some areas of the positive, reduced in Eatonvillu cohesion and undermined the courage of the youth. 
"Black children were accustomed to embrace - I remember this - they have their teacher in the morning, they have their teacher in the evening," she said, N. Y. Nathiriová, daughter of Elly Dinkinsové and executive director of a nonprofit group preserve the Eatonville Community (save Eatonvillskou community). 
It took until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added. 
"Neobjímáte his white teacher, because your white teacher - I want to say that there is a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiriová. 
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many other Zory Neale Hurstonové - black writers, actors and artists who, as she povznesli over bias with lighter self-assurance and quotations such as "How someone can focus their pleasure of my presence. 
It nepochopím. " 
In 1975 doputovala Alice Walkerová to neoznačenému grave Hurstonové and began to fight to restore its reputation. 
Five years later, he arrived in their shelves in bookstores vychvalovaný curriculum vitae Hurstonové from Robert E. Hemenwaye, who once again ranked in American kánonu. 
The project with the interstate arrived just as the most famous daughter Eatonvillu again found the light of the ramps. 
Her former neighbors Hurstonové now considered spasitelku... 
To show what can happen with its interstate destroy, they began to community in 1988 to plan the festival Hurstonové. 
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural address action over two years later, and each January, many on the back. 
The state, after a few years of dálničního draft. 
"Those five currents highway vzkřísilo, you would think that directly odpálilo, real civic pride," she said Nathiriová. 
Boydová said it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory over the highway project to help change the image of the city. 
Mimoměstští as Rachelle Munsonová, lawyer, which began to walk into the of the church in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reassess the past. 
Eatonville joined the national historical register in 1998. 
NOVÁ jednopatrová library (named, of course, after the Hurstonové) was opened in 2006 to again vyasfaltovaném and zkrášleném Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, the Florida-based Eatonville anomalies: Only six miles from the center of the Orlando can sometimes act as intimating alley in the summer rain, as well as small as when it was founded with a mere 27 black families in the 1980s, the 19th century. 
(It is one of the 90 percent of the black.) 
With the strangers who come in search of the story and the importance of Eatonvillu, are still often treated carefully. 
The authorization for the majority of the talks, it is necessary to have in advance and certain things - like murals in the oldest eatonvillském church, which namalovali which blacks and whites displayed in the fields - must not be snapping pictures. 
Many in the Eatonvillu, such as Jones, bold, sebejistá teacher who is fond of deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly recognized. 
And even as the festival Hurstonové has expanded, increased domestic pride. 
Especially the young people tend to see Eatonville, as Hurstonová saw my race: A beautiful, with the problems and so, but there is no better, no worse, and as the proud, creative, pracovitou, pošetilou and heterogeneous as other American race and etnika. 
From the voice Franklinova nephew, 18 Edwin Harveyho, the genuine affection for the commune, when it plans to return to the Eatonvillu after high school, he worked in the local government or the police, who says that it would tail some help. 
And even younger, such as, for example, 11, twins from the Winter Park Alondra and of Alexius Kenonovy seems to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people, when this way only around, he thought, 'Oh, this city is nothing against those of the other,'" she said Alondra Kenonová recently on Sunday after the church. 
"But when you look at the moment to stop and you look into history, it is a very nice city." 
Here in New York City, we were talking about all plynně finančsky 
At first glance, there is nothing had changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stands and obrovitých television screens in Times Square, it would be the first to admit that he is standing in the middle of the storm. 
Never would neuhodli that, in a bee hive proskleném offices over their heads have each day, bankers and managers of mutual funds, who monopolize New York, one of the worst "bad day at the office" from the crisis of 1929. 
Messengers still rattling metal carts on sidewalks and convey pekáče muffinů on snídaňové meetings. 
Hispanics are still moving between věžáky and wear, such as human mules, &amp; bopt; vyžehlených shirts, which hang from vahadel on their back. 
Paper shufflers are still waiting in the queue for their morning bagel in the street all our stalls, and still could not get on a typical day of the yellow get a taxi between four and seven o 'clock in the afternoon. 
It wasn 't as the crisis, as long as I have, with all the rhetoric of pessimism, has not decided on Thursday afternoon in a savings account. 
And yet, I timed this task, so that coincided with the late afternoon siestou on my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there in front of and about 20 people. 
Not before pokladními peepholes that lifted or in cash, but before the bulkhead, where the elderly clients ordering šekové books, tourists ask for the trip to the trade - Macy 's and the new customers are accounts. 
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starra, my "licencovaného personal banker ', came from the same reason, as I do. 
But, as I have chosen their savings from the smaller banks in places where they arrived, such as, for example, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island. 
Use the money from the so-called thriftů (a little like building spořitelnám), the associations, and from those types of savings, whose branches operate in only one state, and to argue that their customers are like family. 
In the past year, 15 such banks quietly go bankrupt. 
A few days later she PŘED Washington Mutual, the bank with assets for 327 billion into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers returning home for the weekend on Friday night, with another bank, Wachovia, with assets under the 440 billion, to capture the rescue buyers. 
ZAMĚSTNANCI offices and shops, who stood in front of me, and they were afraid of the further collapse, přesouvali their cash in the bank, which is seen as a safe haven, which makes the most of a bailout for Wall Street. 
Ordinary New Yorkers in the last week, we learned plynně finančsky. 
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked into the phone and expressing the Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and to its vyhublému Warden Executive Officer Dick Fuldovi with such familiárností, as if laughed about líném colleague. 
And Lyn, uniformovaná roughly 50 - year - old domovnice my building, changed the topic of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angeliny or my donášky food. 
After my visit in the bank, told me: "I am now their savings in the money market funds. 
Beyond it, I will not risk. " 
Muslimské graves znesvěceny after the Austrian right-wing turnaround 
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, right from the Austrian Freedom Party, and Philip Dewinter of Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang participate in the rally, which presented in Antwerp on Thursday on January 17, 2008, the organization of the "Town against Islamization". 
They look similar to the transport brands, which depict the mosque Strikeout red line. 
Police accuses the right-wing extremists of desecration of the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend, in which the extremely right-wing parties have made huge profits in the general election. 
PŘES 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of the Traun near Linz was sometimes between pátečním evening, and by the following morning heavily poničeno and police believe that this was an organized action. 
The guilty nasprejovali at some of the graves of the Jewish symbols, such as, for example, of the star, but the detectives are convinced that this could be an attempt to zamaskování themes of extremists' hatred for the Muslim immigrants.

Only the essence of major championship flamenca, odpoutaných from focus on the interpretation of - just docílím released a man or a woman. 
On the one hand, the artist. 
On the second - the man. 
Inseparable, pomineme-li privacy, in those moments, far from the audience - then can be seen confidential gesture, the depth of a quick snapshot view or a passionate body language the hands, which are carefree, because they are in the pipeline to the scene.

One meets or with human beings, people who sometimes even knows, or will they provide to Taken only a few minutes. 
Despite the similar circumstances as a photographer was always trying to implement his vision. "

America without Paul Newman, so don 't 
"Sometimes the god stvoří perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them. " 
These are the words of the actress Sally Fieldové, who has worked with him on "Without a bad idea" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman had gone, reveals his wife vision of a lonely American cinema and across America. 
Podívejte as they took, he got an Oscar. 
And that was in the income from 2007. 
And that is known that it is very ill. 
And yet, for all chlapák... 
"Sometimes what you feel unable to comment in any way, and I now have lost a great friend," he said, in tears, Robert Redford, "my life and my country were thanks to him better." 
No one is afraid that it will be funny or it will not. 
He died from his father, and the movie in the dark at the time of the country in fear of terrorists and the financial markets, at a time when the US confidence on the bottom, which is desperately seeking reasons to be proud. 
When the time is harsh and people without the virtues, and only a handful of those who is worth admiration - there is a need to be Luis Cernuda, we loved Paul Newman. 
For all the embodied almost platonický ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was an official from Richard Nixon and the fighter for a lost and vyhrané cases, from the Foundation against drug addiction, based in honour of the first-born son, who died from an overdose, until after his own brand of domestic food and biopotravin. 
The prize for the country, which has cost many efforts to move away from the suicide culinary culture. 
Bouřlivá wave of admiration of a Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality. 
The last James Bond, an Englishman Daniel Craig, said that did not die of one man, but the one of the era.

The Olympic Madrid imperfect plants 
Yes, many of us eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failure of the year 2012 it will perhaps 2016. 
But I am I ask: Are we ready? 
If we follow the previous race, so I say: No, no! 
It was about him as the perfect race, and in my mind was the worst, on which I ever was. 
Such a variety attended to, that, if it came to the evaluation and I was the investigator would be a clear insufficient. 
But look at it from the beginning, one after the other. 
Nonsense beginning with raising závodnického numbers, for which one must go before. 
This is not bad, but when you get there, whether to give him everything (including the chip, which has prevented overfill condition track). 
But not. 
Here you had to first to pick up the number (the first nonsense, go there only because) and (after vystání appropriate Front) - what a surprise! - had only a T - shirt size (the other nonsense, because I want the size of XL). 
Where you live? 
This is because of the crisis, decided to buy only a small T-shirt, because it is less substance and are cheaper? 
Well, this is a little in comparison with what happened on the day of the race. 
KROMĚ that have to go very early for chip and queue at him, took over 15 minutes, there was still cast the rucksack. 
PŘES 35 minutes lasted waiting period, which is at the plant, which is expected to 11, 000 people, something sense. 
So, as might have been expected, the race began, and we will still neodložili backpacks, and when they are faced with raising it was much worse. 
The waiting in exchange for 40 minutes rain, which led to widespread Gaulonite sedition which arose and the attack on the cab. 
I believe that 500 of us will have to - morrow bronchitis set, and some, like me, is not display the right time in the evaluation of the results due to the chip, which they gave me and who, as I expect me to make themselves heard the right time to start. 
Of course, if someone asked me for a perfect race, this would be me nenapadl. 
And so I believe that we need to have a well prepared the Olympic city. 
Microsoft is looking for the receptionist (virtual). 
At a conference on the new technologies, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed Microsoft further developments in a new system for identifying the image and human interaction in the manner of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform some basic tasks like to taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, speeches, which would be moved around the area of the company) and, as he put it in an interview. 
Thanks to the at the camera and system, which) identifies shapes and face, may be the "a" to determine how many people in the room who are even remember what they are wearing - and to listen to and understand the key words of their talks. 
They can also categorize present in konverzačních groups. 
On the video, the receptionist demonstračním recorded in the third person and understand that does not belong to the group to speak with her, and that it is not an employee of the company. 
He asks her if for someone, and tells her that she will be paid for a moment. 
All of this without the blue screen of death. 
Amazing.. 
But it is, of course, the music of the future. 
Company NYNÍ is more important things to work, for example, a new version of the operating system Windows. 
This week, a lot of people spoke of a change in strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as much associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer came to that, if the computers were only the bare necessities, without the ballast of commercial useless, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, you will be cheaper. 
As a surprise, given that Microsoft version of Windows since version adds to the new functions and other "extra". 
The change of direction would be záslužný offence. 
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, and is on the software. 
When it comes to the network, Google chrome, I became one of those who favor the theory that it was the first step in Google's competition with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not the operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary, because it is necessary layer to an understanding between hardware and software. 
MÁ the same function as your wife, or your husband, when you have something to say mother. 
It is true. 
Never disappear, but it is important to consider the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but the truth of the relative. 
What he said this week, Ballmer, this idea is confirmed. 
People pay less and less attention to operational system, and more internetovému browser. 
POČÍTAČ, turns to start Firefox or Explorer - or chrome - and each day of those more time on the Internet than around the windows. 
What will serve half the applications, covering the system? 
Less is more... 
And the Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista. 
The less difficult, less laden, less complex. 
Microsoft now has an interest to offer their services in on-line, and finally become the alternative to Google's. 
It is desperately need, and here I am a small example. 
This photo I did in one odpočívárně for employees of Microsoft in Redmondu at the beginning of the month. 
The nápojovém vending machine was the poster, which is to use the search tools: "Your search. Our future." 
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of employees of Microsoft used to search for on the Internet, Google. 
Last week, by the way, was delayed a new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
There will be at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of the day, I would rather počítejme up to 2010. 
In the case of Microsoft, it will try to place on the market, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together. 
The phone is becoming increasingly more computer. 
Whereas the Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay. 
The Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso was carried on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one was in "a bloody diamond," Edward Zwicka, like Al Pacino in "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly and, moreover, is part of the uniforms fleshy gay communities. 
And if we want to talk to the list of his roles, you can dip to the image of the prototypical trichinosis, sharp mustache, which lifts weights in kočovném cirkuse. 
In fact, it is nothing more than a typical cotton male lower tílko, relevant and sleeveless. 
The English speakers him say 'Tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others. 
For the first time for its krkolomné name - even if the people he says he 'Marcel' - which has a link to the sport, because, as she says the legend, was named after boxerovi Marcelu Cerdanovi, lovers of the singer Edith Piaf. 
'Marcel' stands out above the other quality cotton, unisex střihem, B label and (almost invisible) Belgian vlaječkou, which are models nejemblematičtějších tílek as detail in his neck. 
And now, because the Belgian firm nespecializuje only on the tank tops. 
It also produces sweats College, retro boxerky, paisley sweaters, cotton trousers, námořnická T-shirt, leisure for children, mini kraťasy... 
Thoughtful pieces for a comfortable underwear.

Protistresová book is "1001 way to pick" and because of the publishing company Pearson Alhambra and DK will go quiet. 
If anyone has it that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, "guide" this view denies. 
KROMĚ that offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural remedies that contribute to the relaxation. 
If you already in the veins nekoluje surge, which in the body back into balance, and the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit down on the gauč, off and focus on reading. 
Speaking of sleeping 
NĚKTERÉ children in the middle of the night. 
I don 't think those wakes up and busy telling us what happened the day before, but the children who are talking, while he was asleep. 
When this happens, for the first time, maybe you vyleká, but in reality it is irrelevant. 
This is a benign disorder sleep, which is called the somnilokvie. 
It is a fairly common, especially for children and young people. 
Certainly nejednomu of you told that, in the middle of the night, he spoke of sleep. 
This phenomenon can be very accidentally (for example, one for life at high ravings), or with more regularity (every day, every week, every few months...), the second day of a child does not remember anything. 
There is only one reason, which would be its emergence of said. 
It is often linked to other disorders, such as nightmares, a nightmare, enuresis nocturna (night pomočování) or náměsíčnost, but this is not necessarily. 
As was previously mentioned, often can be very high fevers, stress or rozjitřené situation. 
In any case, it is a little probádaný phenomenon. 
Intenzita, with what appears, it is also different. 
DÍTĚ, speaking in a calm voice, to say a single word, whispered back — or to the contrary (screaming, crying, long speeches...). 
In cases where the show with a great power, it would be appropriate for a child to watch and consult with a specialist to determine whether he has a problem for him, causing a lot of anxiety, and in this way is the.... 
We are told that there is a benign disorder, therefore, untreated, only if the přidružuje to a further breakdown of sleep, which can be cured (for example, if the associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress). 
However, we do that, we will have to remember a few very simple preventive measures, such as: 
To try to a child too nerozrušovat, before it goes to sleep. 
Find a quiet game, and to avoid strašidelným or somewhat násilnickým television programmes or series. 
In the case of a very nervních children and those who will work with ease, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them get an inner calm. 
This child will allow peaceful sleep. 
When they appear somnilokvie, try to keep calm. 
Remind yourself that it is for the child of a benign and that of what happened, the next day will no longer be nothing to remember. 
Useful the Board 
He nebuďte... 
It is unnecessary, because it is not conscious and you abort him by sleep. 
Even when he speaks, sleep, and thus. 
Remember that zdá-li you after several that are very worried, it would be appropriate to turn for advice, or to find out what the child makes such anxiety. 
If it is to understand what he says (which usually not so usual), avoid the temptation to hear him and pull out of the information. 
It will be useless, because when he was asleep, it is not in the knowledge that they could arrange ideas. 
In addition, you may hear what he says, but you don 't know what he was thinking, and that is why it says, so you get a lot of attention, as the information interpretujete and the conclusions docházíte. 
Never say a child, that it is in the middle of the night can be questioned on his secrets. 
Neither of the fun. 
This raises a great anxiety. 
In short, don't you worry, it is not a bad thing, it is the only episode, which takes only a few minutes. 
Finally Illhaeusern... 
Finally, after a long period of Illhaeusern, thin again found a way to victory. 
Without would have very large struggle žlutočerní we created more chances, and were able to one of them, triumphantly turn.

Gólman Illhaeusernu, however, the pleasure long nevychutnával, after 12 minutes, he was forced to return to the locker room and leave their racquetball partner in decline. 
But Dannemarie, failed to gain and jedenáctce of Illhaeusern, which is just a little, in order to "zahustila 'defense, which has produced no more difficult, with the exception of the whole of the last few seconds of the game, when the ball after a great confusion hurtling very close břevna.

As is widely known, the national reserve of blood transfusions under approved by the Canadian Red Cross was during the 1980's contaminated virus immune deficience (HIV) and the virus hepatitis C. 
Given this drama, and a wave of indignation to the public, the Canadian government in February 1994 public subject to any form of inquiry, and the judge presided over by Horace Krever, and which should aim to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and formulate recommendations for such a disaster that has already been neopakovala. 
While the judge Krever hesitated, with odevzdáním messages, some of them in the course of the Committee, whose aim was planning a new system of governance in Canada. 
In this role Québeku matters Gélineaův committee. 
After Gélineauově and Kreverově report were in Canada zřízeni two suppliers: Héma-Québec, who had managed Québec, and the Canadian company for the blood supply for all provinces and in both areas. 
"When in 1998 Héma-Québec launched their activities, 38% of people have more confidence in Quebec the blood system," says Dr. Décaryová. 
"The situation was dismal. 
Soustavným effort to enhance the safety of blood products and a permanent work in this area during the years we again to gain the trust of the public, "she says, proudly says that in early 2008 Héma-Québeku důvěřovalo québecké already nearly 94% of the population. 
Dr. Décaryová, however, does not lose sight of that, "confidence is something very fragile." 
Since its inception, JIŽ on 28 September 1998 Héma-Québec aplikoval principle of caution. 
"When we were in Europe are seeing the emergence of many cases of the human form of Mad Cow Disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakobova disease," said the woman, who is leading the company since its founding in 1998. 
"And we remained whether the disease can spread with blood. 
They have one of the basic recommendations Kreverovy and Gélineauovy reports, according to which, in the case where we don ’ t know, and when it is at stake in the spread of serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakobovy disease, which is characterized by degenerací brain, inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take avoiding action. 
In April 1999, we are therefore rejected the blood from the people who since 1980 stalled in the United Kingdom, after a period of not more than one month. 
A few years ago, then it was safely PŘED proven that this disease of the blood. 
This episode of us then showed that adhere to the principle of caution should make sense. " 
In 1999, the market appeared much more accurate technology to detect HIV: Tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT), which can be used to detect in the donor blood directly to the presence of the virus, and not for the presence of antibodies, on which they were based on tests used before. 
NAT tests to reduce the Deaf period, which occurs between the stage of the suffering of the patient and the moment when our techniques can be detected in the blood of the viruses, explains the expert. 
This period, we could be reduced to less than a week. 
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected, without knew about this, and without it might come. 
These improvements to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring HIV / AIDS through a blood transfusion. 
The risk that he will receive blood contaminated with HIV, is now exposed to one man from 12 million. 
"In other words, this means that than someone infected with HIV, it will be necessary to distribute to 12 million blood products. 
Whereas Héma-Québec distributed each year, 400,000 to 500,000 of blood products, will be 24 years before the first case of the transmission of HIV in the blood of the product. 
I have, for now, we can get in a calm, or require a blood transfusion of blood necessary to recover, "says the head of the nation ’ s leadership Héma-Québeku. 
"The challenge for us in the next decade is the safety of our products. 
You never know what choroboplodný element may be lurking in the system. 
PRÁVĚ last year on the island of Réunion, chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by blood bodnutím insects. 
It is important to be cautious, "says Dr. Décaryová and stresses that, in addition to the safe supply must Héma-Québec count also ample supply. 
"Potřeby grow, because the population is aging. 
In the wake of the agresivnějšího treating cancer patients often need a new dose of red blood cells and platelets. 
The aging of the population also has implications for the network of donors in the blood, which in the average consist only of 3% of Quebecois permitted to donation. " 
Any sane person old at least 18 years of age, the relevant criteria of eligibility, but can donate blood only once for 56 days, that means six times a year. 
14% of people offering on average in the blood is taken, because they are, for example, the AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country, where they are battered bahenní chills, are excluded for a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we can maintain the status that meets the needs of the hospitals. 
The, are very rare. 
The members of the network of donors, however, is to be supplemented with are aging and already unable to donate blood. 
But convincing people that they gave blood, it is difficult, especially since then is to maintain and spur to become regular donors. 
Life is now so unfettered that you rarely find an hour to donate blood, "posteskne had Francine Décaryová. 
With an annual budget of $297 million Héma-Québec adds not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart chlopně, the eyeball, and the skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns. 
The following tissues are, processed and frozen before they are deposited with Héma-Québeku, who also manages the only public bank blood from the umbilical cord in Québeku. 
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered to be banned biomedical waste, blood, too, is rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia. 
"PŘED several weeks, we celebrate the deposit of our tisícího blood sample from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that they will take over a thousand a year. 
At the beginning of next year we should begin to offer to transplantacím, "details of Dr. Décaryová, which the collection of cord blood from pupečníkové describes as a very popular. 
"Mom NĚKTERÉ are frustrated that they do not have access to it," because Héma-Québec lacks the resources to enable the complex and expensive program to offer all the hospitals in Québeku.

Charest bets on the north 
The Prime Minister does not preclude that, by the end of the year, trigger early elections 
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (partim libéral), Jean Charest moved into the Jean-Talon in Québeku, where in today ’ s replenishment elections is a candidate new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (on the left). 
"Put the limits of our last great northern boundary:" This is a long-term ambitions, which Jean Charest yesterday unveiled visually poutavým way at the conclusion of the Liberal Party Québeku in Lévisu, without, however, told the details. 
BĚHEM his speech were behind his back promítány images in a obrazovém a.... 
The three obrovitých plátnech running noose with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric dams, mines, Québeku from the point of view of a "Google maps, charts, etc. 
Generous means, like in the pre-election period. 
At a news conference after the Prime Minister refused to rule out that would trigger early elections in the fall, even when he said that he is very much a program. 
"The plan of the North" is the fourth dimension "vision", which the Prime Minister intends to Québec, the vision of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labor, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the agreement with Ontariem. 
Despite the fact that the opening up of the North - the north of the territory's parallel to the Prime Minister in the last time frequently in their declarations, has never been subject to the presentation. 
The Prime Minister, however, reduced to that explained why the North is a "gem with a huge potential," he was doing so, however, the term, the amount of investments, and as a priority in future projects. 
Most mentioned several approaches to points, which could be further we discuss: In particular, hydroelectric power plants, and, above all, the mining sector, encouraged the growth of the rapidly emerging countries and the restoration of the public infrastructure. 
The North, according to Charestova recital, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinu, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds." 
This "territory twice the size of France, is with us," "is in Québeku. 
And it is not just for us, but it is in all of us, "he said, as if he wanted to show that cited a national zakladatelského myth. 
Québec was built largely in relation to the North, pointing out the prime minister: The gold in the Abitibi, québecké engineering, Jamesova Bay. 
"It is our, it is our future," he added, after the teatrálně paused to look at a map of behind their backs. 
The north, 70% of the territory Québeku, includes part of Labradoru, which Québec always demanded, all the prime minister, during a press conference. 
"This is a traditional position, which replay all the previous government. 
There is one of the border line, which has been a long time is the Convention, and nastane-li opportunity, in the name of the governments of this position again zaujmu, "he suggested. 
Otherwise, "it is in the context of climate change also need to reconsider our vision of the North," he said, when he spoke about the transition sever-západ, who, as a result of melting glaciers will open throughout the year. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that the occupied territories becomes obligations. 
And what people in the territory of the original peoples and the Inuit know how? 
The Prime Minister, said that québecká government to them will be very an attentive and that the project will be beneficial, especially the young. 
Two former ministers from the two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau pequistický (a former MP from Ungavy), which began the negotiations with about 30 communities. 
ČINNOST launched meziministerský committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which has an important position Julie Bouletová (Transport and natural resources). 
The Prime Minister does not preclude a large meeting, "not necessarily summit," but the moment "will be vytyčena common vision". 
The development of the North would, after all, should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan for the North will be "jointly proposed, Structure and environmentally sound and," he said. 
Jean Charest described the "vision" as fluent related to the vision of a liberal Prime Ministers, who prevent. 
"As well as liberals, who prevent, we have changed their minds to the challenges of turned into new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was, after all, one of the increasingly přetřásaných themes of the weekend, which was on Friday followed a large koktejlem vyzdvihujícím the 50th anniversary of the start of Jean Lesage as leader of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions proposed překřtít Beauharnoisovu base on Adélard-Godboutovu přehradu. 
"From the Godbouta, who founded the Hydro-Québec, despite Lesage, who carried out the quiet revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectric power generation, after Bourassu, who created the Jamesovu Bay, managed to shape the future of our party," said Jean Charest. 
At a news conference for another authority, this conservative, and on the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbakera, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
When it came to the gate hydroelektrárnu Eastmain1a-Ruper, stressed Charest, that its launch is planned for the year 2012. 
"I say it just between us, but I plan to be on this," he told his membership, which caused considerable applause. 
The Prime Minister, who in April, he said that in the 2008 election will not be, and certainly not in 2009, namely nevyloučil to trigger an election in the autumn of this year, which allows for the law. 
However, he emphasized that its program is charged, in particular, the mission of the Federal Council in China and the summit Québec-New York. 
This weekend congress boss liberals to provide a platform for some of the nationalist resolution, in particular a 'efforts to amend the constitution, "which have undergone very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party Québeku) is particularly recognition" of the specificity of Québeku "in the Constitution. 
He also wants to Québec named part of the members of the Canadian Council for radio and television broadcasting, who should have the right to veto power in the case of decisions taken in Québeku. 
From the opposition was Plan North in its main features is skeptical. 
Secretary PQ (partim Québecois) Pauline Maroisová again, she took out a policy development of the north Québeku, which Landryho government launched in 2001. 
According to her, when the government liberals came to power in 2003, renounced the functioning of this policy. 
If she přidržela, "we should now go on," said Maroisová alongside their candidate in Jean-Talonu (where elections take place today) François Mercureové. 
ADQ said that support the adoption of the Plan North in the government. 
"Přejeme, however, that this was not just a show," he said Sébastien Proulx, Leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is now returns from holiday. 
Letters - Zneuctěná the country. 
Was it Vic Toews, exministr "justice" (oh irony) in Harperově cabinet, who in the summer of last year to say about Louise Arbourové that represents for Canada, "a disgrace". 
Thus potupit woman who led a constant struggle for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, it tells us much about the premiérově surroundings and Stephen Harperovi itself. 
We have a government that, like the one from any of the Western countries nepřevezla back to the country of its national zavřeného concentration camp in Guantanamo Bay. 
GOVERNMENT, which has not taken into account that, at a time when they should take actions that are vytýkány, was Omar Khadr mladičkým adolescentem. 
The government, which still, that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies their word and leaves hnít under frightening conditions of a child soldier. 
One that relies on a parody of justice, to examine the guilt of the accused. 
Consider that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, and the Association of Canadian lawyers to defend the repatriation of Omar Khadra to Canada, could get a fair trial. 
The same government is closing its eyes to the torture: Few of her, what matters is that this young man is henceforth psychologically destroyed, and it is permanently, after so many years of abuse. 
You're not sure, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the words, which Harper so ohání and out of his mouth is such a thing. 
There was a time when there is no longer any morale: Is it possible to the Canadian citizen, the wrong way to treat him, confining him to the head of the EU has a minority government (as it will be the 14th October...). 
Many voters believe that they find salvation in the party, which preaches virtue, Law and Order: See that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and the seriousness of our country. 
Hanba is, sir Toewsi, in this of, and not elsewhere. 
The views - Orwellovský diskurs firms Barrick Gold 
In the issue of the 17th September citing Le Devoir letter Patricka J. Garvera, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company, Barrick Gold. 
Having orwellovskou logic, confirms that the largest producer of gold on the world launched the prosecution of three authors and the memory of a small publishing for libel in order to bring about a "transparent public debate" and requires them six million. 
If true, that the judges are independent and impartial, nesoudí truthfulness, especially in the case of proceedings for libel, but the law. 
NENÍ surprisingly, Garver this crucial distinction completely passes. 
Or perhaps for Barrick Gold the best way to keep the public debate, enough to bankrupt anyone who dared to defend the rudder position? 
Whatever the trial, however, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada (black Canada) will be forced to spend the awesome amounts to be prepared to defend and fight in a very unbalanced battle with the army of lawyers backed up by nearly bezednými pockets mining companies. 
The tactics in these outstanding battles often lies in zruinování them is domiciled in order to promote the conciliation proceedings, which you hold your mouth counterparties and poděsí anyone who ventured to this matter. 
If the company Barrick Gold really wanted the public debate, had its view on the matter to the public opinion. 
Contrary to what is happening in some of the countries where it operates Barrick Gold, in Canada, a debate that under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not in the injuries truncheon and.... 
Thus, not enough mining companies than to open its books, its documentation and establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent scientific teams, which could lead to the entire matter to help bring the light. 
Barrick Gold, however, appear to have confidence in the public opinion and refuses to dismiss out of hand the petition and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada. 
Perhaps it would Garver could explain how may require "public debate", and at the same time, the views of the public to? 
It appears that the word in the viceprezidentově world is only for the bold paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; it is a fairly Condensed treatment of this concept. 
In a democracy, they have the right to speak even nactiutrhači... 
Barrick Gold understand - or does not understand, that the public, which supports writers and editors Noir Canada, so, mainly because it refuses to brutal ways of mining companies. 
The public is ready to hear the Barrick and refers to assess, but on the basis of a civilized exchanges of arguments, not in the context of what many perceive as the prosecution, in which they are to be the defendant zacpána mouth (in the framework of its prosecution of "public debate" company Barrick, by the way, was handed an official invitation to the authors of the Noir Canada to officially announced that it would have to cease the use of this term...). 
Aside from a surreal Garverův speech, prosecuting iniciované Barrick Gold is a direct assault on the university freedom of inquiry and the search for the truth, which are essential for any democratic society. 
Overall, denies the right to the citation of credible sources and to the debate about the facts and interpretacích, which are on the basis of intellectual activity. 
If, in a country like Canada, impossible to study and discuss topics, which is like a rich companies in the world, but without the vystavili duplication of prosecution, who else will be able to do? 
If the company Barrick Gold really wanted the public and transparent debate, could it be if guided by scientific standards, which use the authors Noir Canada. 
MÁ right to the answer. 
The university environment, to which náležíme, can no longer always follow the debate and disagreement and resolve conflicts. 
The company přehnaná Barrick Gold clearly shows that, despite what they say, not the slightest desire to lead the transparent debate. 
For the purposes of the university world, this is a loss, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it's time for the government to introduce measures which would have the same type of irregular prosecution was limited. 
The operation to rescue Wall Street - the Democrats and the Republicans' means 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and ’ s Democrats, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the biggest failsafe economic plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
NOVÁ version of the plan, both by means of 700 billion US dollars hinder the financial crisis, which has already month cloumá Wall Streetem, must still be approved by the two boxes of Congress. 
In particular, it: Better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money, a new measures for the retention of the home confiscated because of a default, and also of the right to monitor the wages paid by workers zachraňovaných businesses. 
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosiová and leader of the Republican Party at the negotiating table, Senator Judd, Gregg, announced this good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after the completion of the dvoudenního negotiating marathon. 
"We made great progress and we reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything was done in such a way as to the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe before the crisis now underway on Wall Street," said a Democrat. 
"This is a crucial point: If we will not do, trauma, the chaos and the disruption of the everyday lives of Americans will be enormous," said Republican Judd, Gregg. 
BĚHEM the last hours of negotiation she ran to a maximum spun out of fear of the effect, what should the next failure on the mood of investors. 
The designated time limit was opening up markets this morning. 
Both candidates for the US president were to negotiations have been invited to attend later, and the two have spoken more for the agreement, without, however, opomenuli to express their discontent with the fact that there was a need to resort to such extreme solutions. 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama think he complete agreement on some measures, in particular, whose goal is to enable the owners of the residence, and the measures on the basis of the work of the State survivors of businesses. 
"When we want taxpayers to take special measures for the sake of the irresponsibility of some of the people, not what the Heimlich maneuver. 
These measures, however, are necessary, "he explained to the television. 
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was dotazován another station, whether or not they will vote for the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that 'yes.' 
"HRUBÉ features, which I read (show), that this is something we all have to spend and what it will be possible to move forward. 
Zvolit inaction is simply unacceptable, "he said. 
The aim of the 700miliardového plan is redeemed for money to the taxpayer dubious claims, and the risk and neprodejná assets of US financial institutions. 
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed the bursting of the housing bubble, which initially led to the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage loans (subprimes), then impose on others, widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and in the degradation of banks and financial institutions. 
The decline in the first draft of the agreement last week is due to Republican House members. 
From the moment that those without the Democrats that, for some of the "toxic" assets of companies having trouble, the government will only guarantee, but neodkoupí is, there is a belief that bezvýchodná situation is eliminated. 
In an effort to bring about approximation of the conflicting views in Congress has been affixed measures that the government will be able to introduce the new charges, which would help get their deposit back, if, as a result of the programme will have to take losses after a period of five years. 
The plan envisaged NOVÝ with input from the amount of 250 billion, which will make it possible to add another $100 billion, if the president considered necessary. 
While the $350 billion would have to be approved by Congress in a new vote. 
In exchange for his help Washington will receive shares in survivors firms, which, in the case of the profits will pay dividends, and that will be able to sell when it is all over. 
The federal government will be able to delay procedures, the seizure of real estate related to loans, to which the plan refers, as well as to set limits on the amount of time and damages to be paid by workers affected businesses. 
Usually the plan would have put it to a vote in the House of Representatives has already, and in the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite everything vynaloženému effort is not yet clear whether their plan will have the green light. 
Yesterday, continue to be against this project rose further votes in both the Republican and the democratic camp. 
"It is absolutely clear that Washington, D.C., you hear," he said in the address of the Republican, Scott Garrett, a member of the Commission of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are part of the solution. 
However, the solution is not to make a poplatnících. " 
Democratic U Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of members of Congress begin ” Committee skeptiků ", with the whole thing, but he comes to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote: We want Congress to make too much of a hurry to see which way the issue," he said yesterday. 
In the same period in Europe again confirmed that this crisis is a crisis of the world. 
After the end of an extraordinary meeting of the three the Benelux countries partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11, 2 billion euros (16, 3. Billion). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that withdraws from the purchase of their konkurentky, which is on the verge of collapse, since lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis in risky loans to buy real estate in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85, 000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers. 
"The money nepřijdeme," said yesterday, the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter barefoot. 
"To return získáváme voting rights in the bank and influence. 
And that is just the savers and households in today ’ s uncertain time can appreciate. " 
On the other side of the channel, La Manche so far, it seems, the British government launched the nationalization of other banks affected by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press should have the government take over all existing loans banks Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion (75,5 billion), the credit for the purchase of real estate. 
According to its previous notification of the issuing of the branch and the accounts of clients in the British banks to Spanish bank Santander. 
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must since the beginning of the financial crisis to nationalize. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons 
Its beauty with azurovýma eyes for a long time, his trump card, according to the other weakness. 
Everything that the American actor with a smile from one narcisizmu? 
Yes, yes and no. 
Shyness, sensitivity and continuing talent, which have their own, it also vzdalovaly from a muscular category, which produces a real stars. 
But what was běžec on a long line! 
Paul Newman died Friday in 83 years on his ranch in Connecticut in the wake of lung cancer and remains one of the the icons fat years of American cinema. 
The less spectacular than Brando, who has been a long and was a kind of his rival to screen the film, Newman was opatrnějším actor, certainly men, but also the Apostle Paul freedom, and the collapse of the dramatic conventions. 
Blood smíšená often creates a wonderful children. 
Narodil in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother the origin of the Maďarka. 
Of these European roots, was one of the famous faces of the American dream. 
Without undue ego, which is the latest sign of quality. 
Because it is zhlédla all of these countries love to self made mana, warrior in the war in the Pacific, injured in the battle, which in the early 1950s he studied drama at Yale, then attended the New York Actor 's Studio and Jones triumph in theatre, television and early in the movie. 
The same man who fought for civil rights, was also auto racing driver, who was second in the race at Le Mans 24 an hour in 1979, and at the same time, sex symbol, and yet that, since 1958 accounted for a model with an actress Joanne Woodwardovou. 
It also departed stinná of this hidden, discrete, socially engaged stars were allergic to fuss with their own show-businessu, which remains a mystery, to a certain extent. 
A decent man, in nejvznešenějším sense of the word. 
The exit of Paul Newman this weekend caused the dizzy milovníkům film, while his big role compete on the black canvas of memories. 
After him defiluje more than half a century is what the American seventh art. 
In the memory of the networks are re-emerging šarmantní cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid (1969), a young man who refuses to his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in a cat on a hot, adaptation Tennesseeho Williams of 1958. 
In the more distant past (1990), vybavujeme its sensitive Mr Bridge, some restless house - in the advanced age of marriage, which fell all expectations. 
So many of the other Paulů Newmanů into history. 
The boxer Rocky Graziano, ztýraný, violent, big offender from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In a sign of hate), Robert wise, the role of the intended for James Dean, received after his death in 1956, Newman said in a company. 
Personable gangster in a master of The Sting (Podraz), the Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Zahořklý and vengeful kulečníkový player in the wonderful The Hustler, Robert Rossena (1961), the same figure ztvární in The Color of s Money Martin Scorseseho, which he will bring in 1987, one of the seven Oscar nominations. 
This is the face of coasting through the ages, it was he. 
And once again, he. 
In his professional career, together for different ages. 
Young, it is mainly because of kultovnímu slap Shot George Roys, Hilla (1977) from the role of Reggieho Dunlopa, non - traditional hokejového coach. 
The fans with him again met in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coenových. 
His career, then cut the roles of godfather Irish mafia in Road it Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003. 
Unlike several movie legends, which is relatively soon left the craft, Newman in the industry for a long time, even though he Hollywood with his pozlátky, style and concessions. 
The French filmař Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, "in a live challenge underplayingu", that, in its way too pressed for a chain saw. 
For some Paul Newman, for which the role came as a platter, the profession was not always so gentle. 
The first lovers, however, played a much less often than outsidery: Neurotiky, alkoholiky, lumpy and zoufalce, whose upadání and rebellion is reflected in his with perfect lines. 
As the director of Newman has revealed little known aspects of their stydlivé sensitivity. 
His film, Rachel, Rachel in 1968 (according to the novel Kanaďanky Margaret Laurenceové), in which the main role played by his wife Joanne Woodward, sensitive female portrait of melancholy.

What happened to in a factory on the invoice Zuschlag & Co.? 
Zanedlouho, on October 8, the proceedings in criminal proceedings against Jánosi Zuschlagovi and his companions. 
Policies and his associates are among other offences, including the falsification of documents, accused of fraud perpetrated in the long term and systematically criminal organizations, as a result of which were caused by the extremely significant damage. 
According to the Prosecutor General used the money obtained in invitations to tender for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks often dokládali market invoices. 
The money from the state and local government - a total of approximately 65 million forintů - to go into the coffers of the organization in part Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the pockets of individuals. 
ZPŮSOB, for which he also investigating office, was that the money raised in the tenders were selected on the basis of the invoices, for whom it was not a real value, and underwriting liabilities associations never fail to live up to. 
According to the indictment was a big part of the invoices false. 
Tiskopisy to these invoices come from józsefvárosského market, round the stamp was produced in Kiskunhalasi. 
The names of companies in which the production of invoices, chose to, inter alia, on the road after the North shore Balatonu, which sent Istvána Ladose János Zuschlag. 
In his testimony, was first appointed by peep out guest houses and restaurants. 
In the most requested accounts for their consumption, according to the model was then produced invoices submitted in the framework of the tenders vypisovaných, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and authority of the capital city. 
The invoice them majority István Lados with his companion Andrásem Őrim, who according to our information, they wrote in the report, the necessary to obtain the subsidy. 
PŘI his "Study path" Lados looked out one beer - hall. 
According to the two invoices issued Zuschlagem and his companions in 2003 to enable this restaurant equipment meals for devadesátičlennou group from clubs Biztos Pont. 
Many people would, of course, according to the statement of the companies in this device suddenly nevešlo. 
As the swarming the formal and obsahovými errors the invoice issued in the summer of 2002, the Foundation named Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért. 
Penzion in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than a dozen people in one night, put it, but it was on the invoice described a hundred and thirty guests. 
Vyplňovatelé forms with a fantasy but it simplistically, even if they were on the documents in a society devoted to the also hotels - Pigal S. R.), in which the accounts referred to in the information provided to the Crown Prosecution Service documents denominated in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá and therefore. 
Leading firms Győző for hvg.hu Farkas said that when he předvolali on prokuraturu and showed him the invoices, immediately knew, however, that it is a fake documents. 
"The name of our business and our tax number were thereon in the wrong place." 
As he said, in addition to the formalities details had checked out or that, according to invoices quarters of a hundred people are only eleven apartments, which have so much capacity. 
Moreover, there was also an indication of meals, with their restaurant long works. 
Ardent producers of invoices to satisfy ourselves, or that the vyhlédnutá budapešťská travel agent to organize the only foreign trip, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which is also neshodovalo with the invoice practices firms have unwisely as a service mediation trip to Hungary. 
Moreover, as a result, in the course of the investigation, said in the document also VAT, while organizing trips to countries outside the European Union was from VAT zproštěno. 
In the four documents drawn up by the Foundation Jobb Jövőért companies the Révfülöp S. R. O. did not agree to, inter alia, or the amount of VAT. The company is not listed 25procentní, but 15% VAT, besides afterwards employees of the hotel only printed invoices, produced an invoice, however, was written by hand. 
Beyond this zkazili "publishers' endorsement by that, in the case of one of the companies said, as it became clear the state, thanks to an investigation by the Crown Prosecution Service, carried out by the activities of the carriage of goods by road, which the company ’ s founding originally on the investment advice nevykonávala. 
That is the invoices issued by the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and spolkům XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, besides provalilo also due to the formal departures - neodpovídajícímu format invoices and nepravému (s). 
As in the case of a company of Ravenna K. S. or Sportovního camp in Kunfehértó, whose leaders have denied that the invoice vystavili them. 
Padělatelé, for example, notice or that the company HIB S. R. O. from Nyíregyházy was at the time of the (2001), when the wearied group from clubs Fiatal Városért in liquidation, because according to our information, winding up the company also denied that the paper went on. 
Invoice afterwards consciously 
The second group of invoicing ` consists of those who knew that have drawn a notional invoice. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért exposed accounts for roughly four million forintů for the Foundation Harmadik Évezredért at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. 
The company VEDOUCÍHO Collab S. R. O. referred to in the indictment were forced to issue a fictitious account of one of the accused Ludovic Györfi. 
The Zuschlagem and his companions worked as well as the company Biogate S. R., currently in the settlement, which in 2003 zásobila Foundation Jobb Jövőért and associations Atlasz and Vörösfenyő invoices worth roughly five million forintů, for whom it was not a real economic activity. 
Nor is the movement of money, because he created the invoices were later stornovány, but the organization has forgotten to bring in their documents. 
In the other group invoicing ` firms are those who have ties to the defendants. 
So, for example, was Iván Kubatov authorized representative of Ukraine, a manager of the company, Delta Trió S. R., engaged in trade with fuel and motor vehicles, are based in Budapest, which, however, the company is not to be found. 
The company launched in October, November and December 2005, several invoices for the sale of the computer in the value of approximately 18 million forintů. 
According to the data the trial investigating bought these invoices kiskunhalasská company Cash Investment S. R., who was from the 14th September 2005 in the disposal. 
Managers of the company was a man from Romania, who was in 2002-2005 the transmission of documents related to the firms also Iván Kubatov. 
As we know, Kubatov during the investigation, admitted that, on behalf of the company issued invoices spolkům Atlasz, Hoppá and foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and take their counterpart. 
However, at the request of the Ivána Kubatova were Romanian zedníky based company Fa-Bani suggest Faipari S. R. O. and Jos-Investment K. with... 
In fact, however, neither of the two firms was dead, according to the defendant because they work. 
Yet his companies were to benefit because, at the request of his lawyer spoluobviněného Zsolta Szenteho, which he also their constituent instrument, issued on behalf of the companies, the invoice spolkům Atlasz and Y-Generáció, Zuschlaga. 
On behalf of the companies, investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani suggest, suggest the investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov to a total of 15 invoices worth $14 million forintů. 
STÁTNÍ Crown Prosecution Service said that Kubatov came to 10% of the amounts referred to in invoices and VAT. 
On the issue of the fictitious invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the Biztos Pont, taking advantage of the man also firm Szi-Beri K. tonnes. 
Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért made in January 2006 proposals in a public competition Foundation Mihálye Táncsicse (TMA), the public utility of the Socialist Party. 
Gained for 500, 000 forintech, but the amount of nevynaložily to the objectives referred to in the draft. 
Failed to make it clear to the TMA five fictitious invoices from the company Works Team S. R. on.... 
These invoices were also found during the search of his office Árpáda Kemecseiho at the Ministry of Education. 
BĚHEM portrayal of the defendants are likely to describe the process of production of invoices, as it has already on the prosecution. 
It may be more interesting, if he chooses to reveal all of himself, the main defendant János Zuschlag. 
His previous testimony is too small, and though he has repeatedly promised that all but, so far as he did. 
The question is whether it is in its interest - in return for payment of a large part of the damage, 50 million forintů, with perhaps the Socialists have concluded an Agreement and Zusi, take it to him. 
It is, after all, so he could even be offended, because his application for a relaxation of the conditions of his detention, a location under house arrest, has so far remained nevyslyšeny. 
While the perpetrators of the crimes, who have far greater damage, which has not yet been neuhradili may be free to browse or at least to wait for the end of against them by driving in their homes, on this option. 
Psychologie trumfování: Why spent more money? 
PŘI auctions are the customers willing to spend more money to overestimate the goods. 
Neurological and economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behaviour managed to reveal investigators from the field of neurology and economics at New York University. 
In their study, published in the journal Science, they don't want people in a competition of the eBay auction lags behind, so I prefer to pay too high a price. 
The research using an experimental auction tried to cover scheme of this "game" in the nervous system. 
One group of volunteers sázela, the second group played in the auction, and they have been using the methods used functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) examined the area of the brain test. 
In the two games could participants to win money, but at the time of the game in the auction, which is an important element of the přetrumfnout the other side, began at prohrávání intensively work unit located below the brain bark, called the striatum. 
This brain region plays in addition to many other functions of the role in "sebeodměňovacím" mechanism through the nervous system. 
It is, therefore, according to the researchers Vyšroubování prices can be explained by efforts to avoid a sharp response striata. 
To shore up his theory was carried out by members of the research team from among economists financial horizontal investigation. 
PŘI him under different conditions licitovaly against one partner of three groups. 
The control group was simply told, what is the real value of the product, and they make the stakes. 
Members of another group was moreover, I if will come from the game, triumphantly, get a reward of more than $15. 
A third group received $15, on the contrary, even before the auction, but in the case of loss came from its members, as well as the money. 
The difference between the two groups was thus all over that one was highlighted win, and the second is the loser. 
ČLENOVÉ band playing "against the defeat of the", however, were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the agenda neurologists. 
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory. 
Those are not vysvětlovaly phenomena observable in the auction the joy of victory and the risku vyhýbáním. 
When the neurological imaging techniques helped us a contradiction between these two theories, so that we now have to a third explanation, "said Andrew Schotter, a professor of government at New York University. 
Hepatitis: When a physician? 
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic infections hepatitis B or C, in Hungary is then this chronic liver disease placed among the leading causes of death. 
POČET domestic cases of infection hepatitis is estimated to be $100, 000, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The cause of this is that people often don't know that they are infected. 
NÁZEV hepatitis is a summary description of infectious damage to the liver can be different viruses. 
In their symptoms are many similarities, characteristic is inflammation of the liver and žloutenka, but the author of illness and injury caused the disease from each other. 
Hepatitis viruses, depending on any of the disease spreading in two main ways: Hepatitis A and E digestive organs (for example, with food, water), turns out to be Hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (semen, poševní matter, saliva). 
Travellers would in any case should be protected against the virus, A and B, against the virus type C vaccine does not exist. 
Symptoms of hepatitis A, there are two to three weeks after ingestion of the infected food, are usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, břišními challenges, drive to vomiting. 
Then, on the skin and eye bělmech creates žloutenka, zesvětlá darken faeces and urine. Treatment can take two to three weeks. 
Die KAŽDÝ year around the world, one million people on the serious nature of this disease, a cancer of the liver and liver cirrhosis kills caused by hepatitis B. 
The main reason is that, according to the estimates, is only one out of every ten nakažený medikamentózně treated. 
Also the hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: If it is not treated, can lead to liver cirhóze or liver cancer. 
Most infected about his illness or not, the agent of the disease destroys the liver cells zákeřně, and so is the first symptoms appear in many cases only for 20-30 years. 
It is very important early prevention, the implementation of the regular for the isolation. 
In the three groups of this disease is about a lot more than in the average: Among people who before 1991 have a blood transfusion of blood, among users of the drugs, and between people with tetováním. 
Currently, the world number of individuals infected with the virus of chronic hepatitis C $200 million. 
Since the disease can show no longer routine laboratory tests, he would be the man in the event that the record for any sign of unknown origin, turn to their practical doctor. 
PŘI Early detection is a disease treat with, the virus can be removed from, and so as to avoid nakažlivosti and to prevent cancer. 
September 30, is the world ’ s day hepatitid, who was the organisations representing the sick worldwide arranged for the first time in 2004. 
Its aim is to draw attention to a chronic inflammation of the liver způsobovaný these viruses on the causes of its creation and the importance of early detection of the disease. 
Those who believe in God, it so much hurt? 
According to the results of recent research works belief in God as an analgesic, which could alleviate the death of already Catholic mučedníkům. 
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, explored how humans affects the belief in God the perception of pain, told the British Daily Telegraph reports. 
In the framework of a fairly concoct a bizarre survey undergone 12 Catholic believers and the same number of ateistů electric shocks while everyone watched malbu showing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results were Catholic believers to a large part of the pain. 
Thanks to the technology closely examining the human brain showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of your brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain. 
The study is the first of a series of investigations, which, in addition to participate in academics and scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university. 
Quite accurately test conducted in such a way that, to his left hand experimental body to arrange the sparkling tool, which published the electric shocks. 
The researchers asked participants in an attempt to intently watched the two paintings: Sassoferratovu the Virgin Mary originating in the 17th century, and a lady with hranostajem Leonardo da Vinci, namalovanou in the 15th century. 
The authors of the research, hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary to evoke for believers of a state religion, while the da Vinci painting chosen so that from the very different, and in accordance with the most reassuring impression. 
Pokusné bodies spend half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this period came in four consecutive parts of the 20 elektrošoků, while separately followed the picture with religious or broad canvas. 
Catholics claimed that, in the view of the Virgin Mary felt "safe", as if they were "cared for" and "relaxed, filled with is peace." 
PŘI surveillance video with religious still felt in her comments about 12 percent less pain than when they were Leonardovo work. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, that the research also attended, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any highly impressive image and ateistů, just as it is to find the right photo. 
"We had to find the image, which will be very positively, from the position of the mother or father," said psychologist. 
Anglikánský Bishop Tom Wright of the results of the research said. 
"They pursue their faith should change, and, in many cases also change our personality," said Wright. 
After a great results it is just a matter of what the effect would be to regulate the pain of believers should, if they have any madonu from Leonardo or painter of this caliber. 
It would look at the quality of the Virgin Mary to achieve even better results? 
You are what of himself to bring 
On their desátých birthday, Google, declare that people may find in his pocket at least as well as well in the sky above his head; they know where they were on holiday, on what is the professional examination and what is interested in. 
By Erica Schmidt, one of the leaders of the firm, but it still is not enough. 
However, as regards skeptiků, činících parallels with orwellovskou dark vision, so it is not clear the very nature of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt, recently put it to the newspaper Financial Times that Google's main objective is to assemble on users even more personal data, which is necessary to ensure that the founders of Google's could keep their original intent, which was: 'Uspořádejme all of the information in the world! " 
According to the zpovídaného Google's leaders stand firm and after ten years of světoborné work only at the beginning of this, in order to be able to work with all the information. 
On the question of what will be for five years, Schmidt replied that he would be glad if Google can answer questions like "what am I to do?" Or "What work would actually do for me?" - on such a seemingly simple questions but softwary will not be able to respond to until know about users enough information. 
Not all Internet users know that, during the search for a precise definition of Internet search terms and, from what IP addresses was sought, and on which side of the candidates after finding they moved on. 
Thanks to the service Personalized Search launched two years ago to users, for example, may keep the history of his surfování, they may be re - to see what they were and what klikli, which, in the long run, the findings tailored to generate much more directly to them - on the same logic will be based and service recommendations, through which we will be system on the basis of the previously mentioned, and performed on preserved preferences to offer products and services. 
What if my data used against me, what if someone looks, what I explore? - they ask users, who are looking to data the monopoly of Google's fear. 
In most cases, it is a terrible, rather than the extent of potential power reprezentované firm, it does not cause a backlash in the users of the Internet, the consciousness of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebelling against the power of the.... 
But it is confirmed by the fact that all the search terms are not only to be collected, but in justified cases may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases of moral rights of users of the Internet, nothing to protect. 
The best known example of the last time she was about the coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles, during which provided by Google, the Brazilian government information, which permit the identification of pedophiles from the community site Orkut, set up by his through. 
Internet users who worry about moral rights, but he could still in May of repose, when a firm hand in hand with the organisation for the protection of the rights of the EFF successfully managed to his right in a dispute with the FBI: Google, so it may not even be in the future, all the provisions of the constitution is obliged to provide any information secretly called the FBI. 
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully carve out of nearly 50,000 Web addresses and thousands sought terms, with reference to the strengthening of the years ago adopted the law on the protection of children, yet, but it failed to get the lists by lots of individual users, or full lists of Web sites and key words, including the period of two months.) 
With a view to Google is so enough rozporný: It is bičován those who fear for their personal data, because they feel that their private sphere and private life will be the fact that will use Google's services, exposed to injury, and the campaign against him with a rebellion, which belongs to the multinational companies, with the conservative image. 
And while American geek culture and its wild strain seskupující around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, which appears in many countries, they see a new generation of velkofirem, "corporation, what now relying on", unlike his rival Microsoft, further due to Windows as the conqueror of the world, however both are working for the same goal. 
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Google, Microsoft does not require its users identification code and do not want them money for their application; an open, free and a fresh source of information and a package of the programmes are much more available, mladistvější, "coolovější" than the practice of official softwarového giant. 
But this may be due to also because geekové exactly understand very problematic relationship of the Internet and the personality of rights, which meant that one of the nejskloňovanějších key words in recent years: The Web 2.0. 
Web 2.0 is not about anything other than on cooperation, the fact that he deliberately private tracks and we are using channels of communication that we have available, and although it is their scope for each other, the principle remains the same: Ukazujeme. 
Průměrný young man can lead to profile a few of community pages from Facebooku after Xangu, which can still connect with other services, such as with Twitterem or applications last.fm, recording his poslouchanou music, all this may then on navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides you can write a blog, which will automatically be his latest fotogalerie, which imposes on Flickr or Picase. 
While we dočíst exemplárních on a variety of cases, of which manifests itself: A friend on the morning of the flood of pictures of the common friends easily come to that, with whom her šálivý friend spent the evening, or can the company out of its worker only because, on his blog they portrayed your honest opinion of chief executives: One thing is certain, the concept of private life, is now completely colonel. 
The man, who lives online life consists of what of it, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today ’ s youth. 
And who wants something to conceal or at least avoid googlovskému monopoly, has the possibility of (starting to be Scrooglem, which uses Google's search system, but deliberately leaves no traces of). 
A significant number of people, for example, is deliberately neregistruje pages on the community that it could not be found. Online applications from Google's text editor after fotoeditor and reporting portal can be exchanged for an alternative version, which is not connected to the server farms and which of us would agree not to install the best possible profile. 
Public opinion not secretly expected, when Google will prove to be the scallops. 
The firm has its current value of $156 billion worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion), AdWords and AdSense advertising areas threaten investment of advertising agencies and the service is introduced to an accelerating the pace of seriously znepříjemňují life not only Microsoft, but also of many other softwarovým designérům. 
In addition to critical observers, however, are also operating zneklidňujícím kontrapunkty impression: The top leadership, for example, rejecting the protests by workers after they drove up to double the fee for corporate turned, arbitrarily frequent daily catering staff under the leadership of the company was too costly, all of this, however, is losing its beside the fact that Google still in 2006, down from the Chinese Government and within the meaning of the Agreement vyfiltruje each of the award, which is abhorrent good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the internal rules of the firm, is never forward neinzeruje new services, only when it can be used, certain, however, is that the očekávatelné problems in the months and years may move the world to new places: While some believe that Google's project to scan and archiving books and magazines take such proportions that soon will have anything to do with the US Supreme Court, and others, at its system of Health, in it, we can build a complete their own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems. 
The fact that Google assembles a genetic database, then can serve as a starting material, and for the next generation of writers sci-fi, the famous it Coryho Doctorowa "Scroogled" describes the with orwellovskými reminiscencemi future in which can be used to humans odstrašivě well bring only with the help of data from Google's.

Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw the stock exchange, said the offer, which has made the Polish party, even though the Czechs the Warsaw stock exchange from the potential new owners of Prague Stock Exchange has already have ruled out. 
The reason for this is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is.

The danger of a collapse of the US financial system is growing steadily, for which eventually pay for the rest of the world.

The world economy hangs in the air - just at a time when there is one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism. 
The threat may no longer be ignored, highlights the newspaper Tages-Anzeiger alarmed. 
States have not yet JEDNOTLIVÉ may send money home vrávorajícím lifebuoy and taxpayers may save before the collapse of the.... 
But zhroutí-li as the dice domina yet another bank, then it will not be enough funds, and other improvised. 
In the long run, it is necessary that the European Union Member States have transferred through their national egoism and unify the control over rozdrobenými financial markets. 
Only in Monday ’ s postonávající the constitution of more than 100 billion euros, reminiscent of the Vienna Der Standard, with fears that, like the Americans will have to in order to resolve a crisis to reach deep into his pocket and European taxpayers, still more realistic. 
The European Union, a crisis, which is like the tsunami had the old continent, and has not yet been seriously tarry. 
"Then" not just whistling stamiliardami euros, but it would be good if he firmly set, in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money, in order to avoid an even greater damage. 
Intelligent car imituje years čmeláka 
What about was the best method of the evolution of the technologies are able to avoid a collision, if not imitation detectors barriers to occurring in the world in the wild? 
For example, in the case of the bees. 
The default strategic idea of the surprise of the project, president of the Japanese veletrhu CEATEC, vnukli times from companies Nissan čmeláci. It was a question of how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions. 
In cooperation with the tokijskou University but Nissan biomimetický robotický management system of the type of BR23C, robotizované miniauto, which is equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate any reductions. 
"BĚHEM flight each bee creates its own personal space, oval sack shape, which is actually very similar to our security protective packaging," he explained at an exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of the marks in the field of technology PR and research and development. 
The important role to play a compound eyes, which enable them to see this in all directions in a field of more than 300 degrees. 
The okopírování functions of a composite of taking engineers after the idea of a laser dálkoměru. 
It identifies the barriers at a distance of up to 2 feet before BR23C in the field of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and send the mikroprocesoru sign, which is instantly converts in an operation designed to avoid a collision. 
Hurdle is trapped in a split second, and then starts robotizované car imitovat movements of bees and turned the wheel to the extent necessary to prevent a collision course immediately change direction. 
Unlike any of the existing system is this výhybný were completely instinktivním manner. 
"If so, robotic car would be unable to react quickly enough to the obstacles have," explains Tošijuki Ando, director of the Laboratory of mobility and the project robotického car. 
MUSÍ react instinctively, and immediately, because the technology complies with the most vulnerable and the inner layer of security protection package, which is the allowance is now regarded as the inevitable. 
CELÝ process must reflect what he is doing a bee, in order to avoid further this. 
This process may not last longer than a wink of the eye. 
But unlike the bees can this movement to move up, down or diagonally, can only be dvoudimenzionální and only in the direction from which they can turn the wheel. 
Instead of endless possibilities, which is trying to offer this, as well as in the case of the car robotického applied only to swing the movement, acceleration and deceleration. 
BR23C uses lithium-polymerové batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life than lithium-iontové variants. 
According to the Andoa is important instinctive, intelligent response, rather than the ability of the processing, the less then the storage of data. 
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few of the incoming signals for the second. 
NENÍ need to be had fostered and responded with an intuitive logic of the founding of the data from the previous maneuvers, therefore, constantly uses only memory about the size of a few kilobytes. 
It does not need memory with giga- or megabajtovou capacity. 
This is the first step towards the development of the technology used for immediate fudging, which would be an estimated Nissanu could get into the series - manufactured wagons within ten years. 
The other option may be a link to the satellite navigation system of GPS units, which would avoid that lies obstacles in the way of conveying motoristu to specified the ultimate goal. 
Painfully expensive child has even the name 
The law on the package to rescue the economy in the $700 billion, which is to be divided into several instalments and whose goal is to buy meager lending banks, has written form. 
In the first round will be used half of the amount. 
After further talks, which ended up on Saturday after midnight US Eastern time, the leaders of Congress have to deal in a few days of debate on the failsafe package in a total of $700 billion, the agency, told Reuters. 
"We have achieved significant progress," said Nancy Pelosiová, the Democratic president of the House of Representatives, under which have only the drafting of the Agreement. 
The compromise on the package of support as well as both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the outcome of the compromise, said: "The programme will work, and it will be effective, however, it is necessary to take further steps". 
Písemná version of the package was published before Asian markets open on Sunday at 8 hours a night, Washington time (i.e., on Monday at two o 'clock in the morning středoevropského time), but no specific rise on stock exchanges does not cause. 
On a proposal for a legal standards slyšící in the name of the law on the emergency economic stabilization of the 2008, which is to establish a program, will on Monday to vote as soon as possible, the House of Representatives, then there will be a range in the Senate. 
President George W. Bush talked with Pelosiovou on Saturday night, after reports of the agreement while in the White House. 
"With the progress, which was in the middle of the night, we are satisfied and very aware of the value of the efforts of the two sides to stabilize our financial markets and our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto. 
The program is, after all, are different from the original draft of the Bush administration, in which should go on to buy meager securities collateralized mortgage spent all of the $700 billion. 
NYNÍ, it is possible to spend in the first round of not more than half of the $700 billion, and that $250 billion will be used immediately after the matter as expected on Monday, Congress, and the Treasury Department to buy mortgage-backed securities, which are evaluated as a low - grade, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the decision of the President. 
The programme will be controlled by special, which will also be a member of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
Spending in the second half of the 700 billion budě depend on the decision of Congress. 
The Treasury Department may, within the meaning of the law to the combined tactics: Can also buy low - grade loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and other "toxic" loans. 
To buy may be carried out in the framework of the auctions and directly, told the competent officials of the Ministry of... 
The legal standard will allow the companies to participate in the insurance program, in which they provide the Treasury guaranteeing the means representing the reason for concern, under which the company pays the price of the corresponding to the amount of expected losses. 
As Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary funds to, in order to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system made up to 700 billion dollars, whether it will be a massive buying bad assets, on their insurance, or to prevent systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions. 
"We will have taken the necessary steps to be prepared for the law to introduce as soon as it is signed," he said. 
The managers of the bank that ran into difficulties and waiting to assist the State, on the contrary, they can count on the fact that the government reduce severance payments - which in overseas slangu says simply "golden parachute". 
The restrictions on their payments only in certain cases, moreover, these restrictions will depend on the nature of the assistance provided by the Department. 
OMEZENÍ essentially means that, if the State Department to buy in the framework of the auction, will be on the golden parachutes imposed tax allowance, unless padlí directors banks sent straight into retirement. 
In the case of direct buy a meager loans the government aggressively take action in order to ensure that the money for the leadership has been exaggerated. 
To say that the existing contracts for gold later will not change, restriction applies only to new contracts, which is to be a further incentive to participate in the program. 
"This is the first case in US history, which will be valid legal restrictions relating to the payment of the Directors - General," said the chairman of the Committee for the financial services of the House of Representatives, a Democrat Barney Frank. 
Moreover, in the fall of the State of the banks involved in the programme, the right to obtain a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because as soon as the economy along with zachráněná Bank will stand up on his legs, can be on this transaction and earn. 
The plan also includes a proposal that, in the next five years, the president of the Congress must submit a proposal providing for the manner in which can be tax create the expected loss of the financial sector. 
On both sides there is, of course, and the voices of expressing in connection with the plan of doubt. 
"This to us, the American people 508, this is the taxpayer dollars disruption," said Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa. 
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kapturová believes that the adoption of the provisions of the pressing precisely those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The debacle was for the CSU quite surprising, but on Saturday, he finished the process, which can be expected to be almost exactly ten years: She had finished incontestable hegemony one státostrany. 
JIŽ ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU on 47,7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s under 50procentní border. 
This happened three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, even in so often připomínaném Stoiberově period. 
The cause of the modernization, which CSU in this country have consistently implement and požírá their parents. 
Sociologists it forecast for 40 years, but in the pace of the very zmýlili. Secularization, the results of the training, to resettle the Germans from the East, and from the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria, however, still could not be, without consequences on the loyalty of the electorate CSU.

In this direction OPAKOVÁNÍ comes into account. 
MOLTERER responded to the red offers carefully. 
As he said, cooperation, it will not be successful unless Faymann would try to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.

CSU: The temporary mercy 
The fate of the dosluhujícího duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October 
Despite the shame of electoral debacle has not yet nepadaly heads, the debate about personal matters was my Bavarian CSU so far odročena. 
The President of the Party Erwin Huber and ground Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their places, the question is, establish such a pardon would take. 
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17procentní loss of votes, decided last October of the weekend of the Congress Party. 
ČLENOVÉ very kritizovaného duo, in each case, they heard that their posts will not stick of all forces. 
So infuriated tried to reassure members of the factions and bases, who, because of the loss of the absolute majority demanded a day after "Bavarian tsunami" draw the personal consequences. 
PŘED five years ago - the truth, even under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at the top of the career - received Christian-Social Union 60,7 percent, and now, a year after a coup against Stoiberovi, however, could only on 43,4 percent. 
CSU was in Bavaria, producers of the 18 percent of the German GDP "samovládcem" after 46 years. 
Continue to have the Conservatives in the south of the country, which is essential for the economy of the crucial importance of, a high position, but in the future they will in any case have been forced to the coalition. 
One of the first signs of reorganization within the Party is the fact that a member of the narrow výzvědného team, which starts sondovací negotiations about a possible coalition of Munich government with the liberal 's FDP, or with the political right - oriented group Free voters, and the vice - chairman, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst SEEHOFER, who is considered a possible Huberova successor. 
It is an irony of fate that, on his ticket Freedom of the voters in the Assembly, Gabriele Pauliová, whose appearance against Stoiberovi duo Huber-Beckstein used to carry out the coup, but then with an ambitious municipal političkou did ruthlessly short process. 
The head of the leaders of the CSU now focus all of their energies on how Becksteina to stabilize. 
In the interim period would receive an active role also Stoiberovi, who had been as strings from behind the ground, a former Prime Minister and a former chairman of the CSU has called on 28 September nejtrpčím on the day of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber said several jízlivých notes to address the CDU, according to him, would have been from sister party resulted from a far greater support. 
The other politicians CSU by the defeat as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel. 
After the elections in the Bundestag assumptions for September 2009, the Chancellor Merkel is the power of the state, where the CSU, who played in the national success in 2005, an important role, jointly somehow does not on its feet. 
Under Merkel, which is due to the more difficult to hiding their disappointment, there will be the loss of positions CSU negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition. 
COŽ, of course, is a relative: Treats wounded CSU will not be simpler and crisis of the Social Democrats, insists on. 
The SPD has achieved in Bavaria, with 18 percent of the weakest result since 1946. 
Lukashenko: The opposition - 110: 0. 
In Sunday's election with the Belarusian parliament, not one opposition member. 
The explanation for this may be in accordance with the Russian observers panujícími cheat and stability in the country, led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) nezákonnostmi, occurred during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, which sent the 450 observers from 43 countries, the choice of recognized. 
Although 110členný legislature 10milionové country lacks the opposition for well over a decade, the opposition with under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before včerejšími election seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who was left on the basis of the amendments to the Constitution in an election with diskutabilním progress in 2006, and the fourth time to resume his presidential mandate, "allowed" to ensure that, in Parliament, there have been a number of opposition members of Parliament. 
ODS and dropped from the previously considered a boycott. 
In the background, the opposition the expectation was that the more dependent on Russia economically still Belarus - which to mitigate the impact of the constant zdražujícího Russian imports of natural gas was credit and helped to ensure that the company Beltransgaz, pipelines passing through the country descend into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, for the sake of běloruskému political establishment evaluated as antidemokratické Lukashenko and other senior politicians are not an entry permit. 
The release of previously might suggest that the OSCE for the assessment of the campaign put an emphasis on the positive developments, and not on the shortcomings of the - such as a ban on the run for a third of the opposition candidates. 
Pondělní blesková report the OSCE has, however, had reservations and to the campaign, during which the opposition candidates, in fact, they appeared in the press, especially the fact that the opposition can be present the counting of votes. 
At the same time, according to the opposition to feel in the political system, improving: Political prisoners were released on freedom and Minsk is willing to talk with Moscow and into smaller confrontations, though still refuses to recognize from Georgia as South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which consists of Belarus on paper svazový state, these two territory for the month as an independent. 
"We have two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that he began a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our sheet Alexander Milinkevič. 
According to the opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006, it is desirable that it also remained, however, that "the power to dismiss the parliament, frivolous zalekla into a single member of the opposition". 
PŘI view on the results of the opposition not protest action, rather than trying to provide voters with its message about the necessity of economic reforms. 
"With this, we are, of course, a lot of the problems, the opposition leaves we print in Russia, the distribution of hindering the local authorities, but, even so, I can see that change to encourage more people, even among older," said Milinkevič with regard to the fact that the former regime, which for its greatest success is the creation of social security, regarded as the most or officially supported the layer of retirees. 
"Because of the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit is only a matter of time before the social security 'navozující silence the cemetery' collapse," says Milinkevič. 
Unlike the opposition politician scrambling Russian observers of the elections as a democratic. 
The head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergei Lebeděv, the Russian news agency Rio News, said that "people do not trust the words, but the action", so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the Belarusian voters.

Now, with the publication of the notice of the European Commission, which in one of the official report widespread in Brussels, he quotes opinion Komitétu for science on the health risks, which in the last time experiencing and have been identified (Csrseri) of the EU. 
"From a scientific point of view -- is in the notes -- shows that have lasted 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to music using portable musical instruments, a week more than an hour a day and maintain equipment at high volume, they risk permanent hearing loss". 
"It makes me worry that such a large number of young people who are often portable music devices and mobile phones to high acoustic levels may unwittingly injure their hearing an incorrigible manner," says Meglena Kuneva. 
"From a scientific findings -- continues to lead -- is a clear risk and the need to respond quickly. 
This is the most important thing is that we need to encourage consumer and to publish such information. 
We must continue to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific findings, in order to become the most efficient and to keep pace with new technology. " 
Brussels has asked for independent scientific komitétu that this problem examined, due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of origin. 
"Scientists -- he was the chief executive officer of the EU -- confirmed that it should be worrying and now the European Commission report, together with the other members and the parties, which have raised the issue of what measures would be unable to establish and thus better protect children and young people from vystavováním noise, whose results are portable musical instruments and similar devices." 
Currently, there is already a security European standard, which is constrained by the level of noise portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but are worried about the damage to the hearing, which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise. 
It can be a very limited the damage by the fact that we find solutions, such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure. 
In his beliefs, the Scientific Committee of the EU states that users of musical instruments, to the extent that the use of loud music (more than 89 - decibel loss) for only five hours a week, is currently in force corresponding to the maximum authorised by the noise levels in the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer period of time, they risk after five years of permanent loss of hearing. 
This problem should relate to have lasted 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity may be vyčísleno between 2 and 10 million people in the EU. 
ŘÍM, Alemanno allow free of the Commission for the future of the city, 
Today it's going, in March shut in June, we will have the money. 
Such is the calendar that Campidogliem workers "by the Commission for the future of the city of Rome," which met this morning in its new headquarters for Caracallským lázněmi. 
In the six měsích President Antonio Marzano variety, and the other 49 of the members of the Commission shall draw up a manual for Rome. 
In March, when they closed the door, Giunta and township board will evaluate the analysis and projects, so that in June could imagine a strategic plan for Rome with "the official stamp" Campidoglia and his with Gianniho Alemanna. 
"The Commission is completely independent and there are included in all of the political, social and cultural ideas -- wants to emphasize Alemanno – Is the need to ensure that the proposals for the development of Rome, which eventually apply political arbitrator, which shall remain Giunta e municipal council. 
This is not about any exchange of functions, but only for the effort to have a place where the processing of a major project to Rome. 
In March, will be completed the work and then dissolve, because this institution shall have the exact time limit. 
In June, announces the mayor -- envisions a strategic plan and seize the work performed by the Commission for the future of the city of Rome. " 
On the other hand, who accuses the Commission of inadequate whereas its opinion is not binding, Alemanno respond: "Everything depends on the work of the Commission, which will be able to do, and on the quality of their proposals. 
If they are good, such as the proposals from the Commission Attali, and I am sure in Rome, the benefits will be decisive. 
Too often, the politics of rozplácne on daily problems and naléhavostech, which shall from time to time there. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look for a longer period of time, and in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future. 
KROMĚ, wants the mayor of Rome stressed that "the Commission is not just a firm or blaf: It is completely free of charge, the Roman citizens will become the euro and serve to popřemýšlení and the involvement of the best intelligence, which is the main city has". 
For Alemanna, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, nor the definitive or still in order to be able to afford to our city authentic rise to the level of the measures that need, and think unified the spirit of its future...." 
The future, which specifies the mayor of Rome "is not limited only to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in the Daily optics for the future of the city and its legal status of the city, but also includes the role that Rome can and must carry out as the main city of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama? The first antiamerický President... He knows why 
One of the best known for the American president, he wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second antiamerickým president." 
PRVNÍM was Jimmy Carter, who their decisions zdecimoval the US economy and kept relations (as even today as a private citizen) with the enemies of Islam ". 
The attacks on Obama are increasing just at a time when it is closer to the date of the election. 
One woman from the University of Miami, wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambition. 
Obama has but the impudence: They think that gets to the top of the nation, the town has two guvernátory and five black senators! ". 
In fact, say many of these attacks, "; they are attacks clearly racial origin and do not correspond to the question of voters: It will be a good president? And then we also surveys; all say that Obama wins and by a wide margin. 
Even in this case, there are those who are in the heart and not according to the brain. 
One newspaper from Mississippi, out of the middle of the southern United States, write a comment: At least once in the electoral kabince know very well, who can vote for the US Patriot. 
The povrh one page of the American mentality, which remained skytá until the last moment. 
Říkejte, what do you want, in the end, the postaráme themselves, who check whether Obama or McCain bill. " 
There are people who vow to: If Obama should win, we from America. 
These are the things that have not yet been never vysloveny, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate. 
But, despite all these considerations for the Democrats is the main weapons of George Bush. 
Dotázali with 1,500 people: What are the mistakes made Bush during his mandate? 80 nine percent said: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, the nation has lost 50, 000 soldiers and sent him home to be dragged kicking into a trance. 
Zratilo life 4500 soldiers in Iraq, and the Americans were forced to collapse. 
And yet it has become Iraq for most of Bush's weakness. 
Who will take his place in the Georgia W will have to do a huge task. 
The economic collapse of the US felt and journalists: In the press is the investigation period, and many are blaming the Internet, "killer" publications. 
Pew Research Center dotázalo five hundred journalists on the status of their profession and provided with regard to the future. 
Now they are now almost all journalists pesimističtí about its future. 
However, the &amp; bopt openly they didn ’ t that they have less concern about the credibility of the.... 
They do not feel isolated as it once. 
The problem for the American journalists money, the money. 
For these journalists is a crisis of 2008 crisis of bad economic model. 
Outside it cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors are working to put together a newspaper, are a huge problem. 
According to the journalists, said that this is a problem to be solved if we don ’ t want to do traditional journalism, as it understands the broad public, fundamentally changed. 
The American journalist pervades the clear, but the complex pessimism. 
Six out of ten journalists of publications and executive seniors are convinced that journalism in the national scale is the wrong way. 
In the local area is the executive group to 65%. 
Printed on the broadcasting. 
For a journalist it is difficult to see where it is the Web. 
VĚTŠÍ publishing on its way to the Internet, which many see as a "killer" publications. 
"Economic pressures," in which journalists suggest, increased by up to 79%. 
Five hundred of those journalists admitted that the resort to technology, in the hope that their novinařinu "by something good." 
The biggest gap in American novinářství is among those who drive the newsrooms -- this is key -- and reporters, who were working for them. 
56% of leadership at the national level, he is certain that their reporters shares their values, while on a local level, the value of the falls to 23%. 
This is for someone about what to do with the "certainty". 
Managers who think that they will lose their jobs over three years, is at the national level, 47%. 
As for the journalists, move to 30%. 
If it is a "some work" relating to the staff of our editors, East Germany) in America is still on the day. 
Only 13% of the journalists working on the contract. 
In such a great nation like the US, with three hundred million people and thousands in newspapers, magazines, rádiemi, TV and the internet employers often offer what they want, and so is the question of take it or leave it. 
The leaders are almost always huge salaries and editor, can earn and tens of thousands of dollars a month, in addition to the payment of pensions and insurance. 
What, then, is permissible, the argument becomes more difficult: A certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to achieve the 15 days after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists, according to his own confessions, often occur in the course of one year. 
It is only the issue of climate change. 
UNIPOL: A court in Rome, DANILO Coppola remains V GROTTAFERRATĚ 
The President of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the entrepreneurs with real estate Daniel Coppoly, who asked, in order to move from its cities, Grottaferraty, in an apartment in Rome. 
Coppola is examined for bankruptcy in connection with the sale of Unipol-Bnl protinabídkou. 
BĚHEM process at their own expense, he won the last week of release from prison, which has been transformed to forced permanent residence in Grottaferratě. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked to businessman with real estate could change the place of residence of the rural town in the city. 
But according to the court this move (against which expressed pm) if he would affect his company and get to the evidence to charge him. 
The elites in the 
This phenomenon was already a few days before, when the tank representantů záchrannému voted against the plan to provide a $700 billion submitted to the White House: Much of the Americans are more interested in and for the punishment of Wall Street than to rescue the economy. 
It was also confirmed yesterday's New York Times, which we were informed that the current crisis rozpolcuje Republican Party ever more divided between their old soul to the East Coast, softer, appealing halfway to the federal institutions and the world community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, the conservative, hostile toward "to those from Washington," and to finance the rest of the world, especially in the United States in the middle of, and in the south. 
The soul, which is arrogant sympathy vote, on which I spoke at the beginning. 
This is the citovaná thing, however, is an example of the change, the big changes to the current economic earthquake has already shows: Not only in the United States, but in the west, and perhaps not only here. 
In both the US and Europe it seems that this crisis works as the throttle phenomena, which have been in the incubation for a long time, which, in the new climate utužují finally come to light. 
PRVNÍM from these events is reaktualizace, extraordinary revival of the market, double the category Stát-moc in relation to a re - nationalization has economics. 
The crisis is indeed crisis bankovně financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which are included in the budgets of the people and families living in a single country, in a single state. 
COŽ created at the same time, the political problem for those who follow him: It means to respond to problems and protests of people and families, which are, inter alia, voters. 
In short, the crisis seems to be economically in the world, but politically almost exclusively national. 
The political mezinárodnost seems to be significantly outside the game or that have nothing much to deliver: An obvious evidence given to the European Union, which is divided as always, between the various interests and various state strategy, and which can opt for the one common political line. 
And so everybody has been waiting for intervention by the government of each individual state rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and the allocation of funds: At the time, when we are in a crunch, only they have the economic means, the amount of the financial resources to be able to try to get everything right. 
And also in possession of the necessary resources and powers that it might use: Two sources of the immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organizations could never have in a similar fashion. 
This new emfáze crisis to státně-národní element, which is, after all, in complete accord with ever greater significance, which is trying to the last economic progress may be attributed to one factor with him closely associated: The territorial jurisdiction. 
Ironically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom sitě, increasingly sophisticated technology, imateriální, while we were convinced that the global finance have been fated to govern the world, from nothing, we realized that our future will have to the increasingly deal with such little nemateriálními things like water, corn, diesel. 
All things, who it was said, may be transported from one place to the country on the other, they are, in any case, absolutely, ohraničenému space, the territory. 
So who will be their ruler, is certainly far more cards at snap than who he is and who has the misfortune to live on the spot without the grain, oil and without water. 
I get to the other novelty, which, however, sees break. 
Those who talk about territory, the state government, inevitably talk about politics, about the leadership. 
Having regard to the economic crisis, it seems that to create two konvergentní phenomena. 
On one side of the awareness that is objectively need authoritarian leadership, the request for someone who would be able to seize the situation. 
On the other side of the wave of zdiskreditovanosti against the existing leadership, particularly in the economic, which turned out to be just as unsatisfactory and full of dark places. 
And together, something deeper and, in some sense to get excited about: Zdiskreditovanost, impatience, a sense of failure and the absence of trying to dominate the entire ruling class in a more Western countries. 
It seems that is increasingly broadens masách population in the belief that their actions were the same as ideas still popular elites, as their method of feelings, and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite have overcome their time and is indifferent to the views of the majority. 
A requirement of leadership, DEPENDENT ON HER from the underground one branch, but a strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and traditional political order is into the electoral "odbojích" or unexpected changes in the collective sentiment in the past, and the latest period, from the conservative rise in Rakousku-Bavorsku to the collapse of Labour in the United Kingdom, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps it has something to do and the victory of the right in Italy). 
I have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their akreditovaná intelligentsia, someone would tell their format, have bigger problems to understand, represent, which, not from today, creating in the deep layers of Western companies, and that the economic crisis again strengthens, growing, potentially too cloumá. 
PŘED this would have been exaggerated talk about a "mass revolt". 
But I can't say that it is to have had his eyes open. 
The Super glue to than walking on the walls 
To overcome the laws of gravity, thanks to the Super lepidlu and in the future, go to the walls like Spiderman. 
This is the subject of the various American research centers, and is now a team of four institutions to him very much closer. 
The scientists have managed to keep the stokilogramové body was on the vertical wall with stickers of just 2.5 centimetres square. 
The study -- in the American journal Science published a discoveries of some researchers University in Dayton, in Akronu, Georgijského technological Institute and Research Laboratories Air Force. 
The material, who invented the team of researchers is the development of materials already existing, which used special structure of carbon, which is the name of carbon tiny tubes. 
"The gums can imagine as a series of pipes lying as facing a heap of means," explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgijského technological Institute in Atlanta. 
Scientists are inspired legs gekonu, - the microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adherence. 
Tests carried out on different materials like glass, Teflon and friend paper showed that new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and, at the same time, "simply odlepí from the walls," explains Liming Dai, the Explorer Engineering School Daytonské University. 
Walk the walls? - - - "This material could be useful as a temporary sticker," he adds Liming Dai. 
Perhaps than walking to the walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers thought about the far less had to use as a combination of electrical equipment, because the tiny carbon tubes are wires heat and electricity. 
Other applications could relate to the air space engineering. 
No prozatím super heroes... 
Further research -- also University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to research a new glues. 
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, kalifornští scientists introduced to glue formované from micro fibres such as hair, which are the ones from the dust movement after the area that still retain the perfect přiléhavost. 
The drugs: Never with juices 
On the grepový, orange and apple juice. 
If you take these drinks, which consumed primarily in the summer, because they are bracing and full of vitamins, along with some life zachraňujícími drugs, their stomach is amended amplification, or a reduction in the efficiency, with serious consequences for health. 
To David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, he emphasized the risks of džusů both finished, so fresh in combination with the stomach of certain drugs, on a current 263. national meetingu of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia raises new alarm is one of the few grepového, pomerančového and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life zachraňujících drugs to anulování their beneficial effects and the issue of the health of patients at risk. 
Grepový juice has already been accused, that is responsible for the increase to the levels of the toxic effects of certain antiaritmických drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitik, antihistaminových and neurological symptoms. 
The drugs IN AT RISK -- Oznámila it myself Italian medical agency in the information bulletin board two years ago and galvanized the doctors and patients to nepodceňovali hazards arising from this mixes and attention to what the drink, in the event that take drugs, such as an example of Diazepam or metadon. 
Not only the grapefruit -- According to the experts also orange and apple juice contains substances that drugs utlumují. 
A long list of the effects of utlumených grapefruitem and other juices. 
Hence the appeal Micheleho Carruby, director of the pharmacological department at the State University in Milan: "Such discoveries are mostly immediately notify the various international and national lékárnickým agencies, which eventuelně arrange and exchange information instructions to the drugs. 
So you always illustrative of the drugs, and if you find something unknown, nezneklidňujte, but ask your doctor or pharmacist, if necessary to clarify the "stressed the expert for the agency Ansa. 
Paulo Krugmanovi Nobel for economics 
The Nobel Prize was awarded an American Paulo Krugmanovi for his studies of the commercial models and the location of economic activity. 
Krugman is 55tiletý Novokeňan, who teaches at the University of Pricetonu and who is known to be editor of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the most important critics when it comes to foreign, economic and political steps by the Bush administration. 
A few months after the atentátech in September 2001, in the days when krachoval Enron, Krugman predicted in a single notes issued in the New York Times, that the second event will be in terms of the impact on the history of the United States, is far more important than the first. 
Předpovědˇ, which caused much controversy and who for years has been vyčítána, which, however, has proved to be accurate. 
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which the bridge like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the interests of the public, said Krugman at the end of the year in 2002. 
According to the Lorenza Biniho Schioppa of the Executive Committee of the Central European banks is Krugman "economist of great importance", but also popularizer, who has a "very aggressive style, especially critical against the excesses of the Bush administration ’ s liberalistické". 
The Open Office, we are the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft" 
It is the day of issue of Open Office.org 3.0, package of open source of personal production, which is geared to penetrate for still more users, from home to office, from experts to the public sector, such as a free alternative známějšího Microsoft Office. 
After about an annual work of voluntary workers, under the sun Microsystemem, the new Open Office shows the general public with various's innovations: Welcome screen and the revised and vylepšenému otevíracímu window add other, far more significant, as the compatibility for operational system of Apple Mac OS X, and the new format odf (Open Document format) 1.2, the last of the standard version of the ISO. 
The emphasis will be on cooperation with the package Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the file with the new extension Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting are the special features such as some models of what will be allowed to shrink the size of the Presentation PowerPointu, useful for example for the transmission of electronically, or the ability to transfer the folder PDF into a model of graphic design and to preserve the original appearance of the page. 
Still, from this point of view, we can create documents "PDF hybrids", which is similar to a typical grafice format, Adobe and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or text program. 
SPOLUPRÁCE is element, which has many of the improvements within the applications programs: In excellu can be combined to work between the different users and to avoid conflicts on the changes in the text of the programme is to be allocated to komentářům spolupracovníkovi one color, that was clearer identity in a stage. 
NĚKTERÉ firms are also on the transfer of some of the functions of the Open Office on the Web (on the Cloud), and in the following weeks, they should set the ultimate outcome. 
The Italian version of it can be downloaded at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html, was added to the English version, which is located in the mirroru from Friday. 
KROMĚ Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system. 
The installation cd may be at the request of the sent home or in the workplace. 
And if the topic bezplatnosti may be tahákem to spread in the home, is on the commercial area of the Open Office package a lot of bets, and can no longer be counted with a variety of projects of gold in the public sector and in schools. 
And there are offers training advice and assistance services, ideal for small and medium sized businesses, which could open a commercial perspective. 
The Open Office consists of five main models: The writer for video of writing a word; Calc is spread Sheet, who is to replace Excelu; Impress for the presentation of a similar Powerpointu; dBASE, as in the case of slavnějšího Accessu, is a program that will allow work to databases; Draw, eventually, is a model. 
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5% million downloadů, and weigh that by now we are at almost 3 million and 600, 000, with the release of a new version of it is possible that the number may be even překonáno. 
Kohl also, the results are positive, it is the fourth case of drugs 
NOVÝ positive case on the Tour de France: The Austrian throne Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and the winner for best vrchaře T-shirt. 
The report quoted the pages of the journal L 'Equipe.. 
26ti - year - old Kohl is the fourth skaters positive ceru, EPO third generation, after the Italians Riccardovi Riccò and go with her Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefanovi Schumacherovi, and he of Gerolsteiner. 
The results of the blood samples Kohl fall into those which have been carried out in recent weeks, and the Chatenay-Malabry laboratory Losanna. 
If the analysis confirms pozitivitu on ceru, like losing a third place in the Tour, and he will have to face laid down two years diskvalifikace. 
The report on the pozitivitě Kohl for EPO the third generation confirms that the head of the French antidopingové agencies Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he was informed of the outcome of the Austrian government authorities. 
- year - old 26ti like is placed on the steps of winners for Španělem Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansema, he also won the best vrchaře puntíkované shirt. 
Immigrants: The New York Times, the question IS Italy RASISTOU? 
Italy "as a country of immigration is only in the last house turned on a priority objective of immigrants' adopted with the opposition. 
It is a beautiful country to the nation racist marches? They ask in one long an article in the New York Times, which on this Article debate on the topic rasizmu in Italy, and the case of a young Abdul William Guibre originating from Burkiny Faso, slain last month in Milan, because it had been stolen box of biscuits. 
This case zviditelňuje what the New York Times define "the paradox of the north,": Northern regions are at the same time as those where the voter "more integration, and more work," but also "the strongest antipřistěhovalecké sentiment in the country and the strongest support for Northern League". 
In order to confirm the increasing tension between the Italians and immigrants, NYT cites the cases of intolerance of Milána, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna. 
Not only.... 
Also new legislation required Legou, which is trying to impede the immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy. 
Tendencies zdůrazněná as the pope and the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after he met with Benedettem XVI at the Quirinale, has asked that the state and the Church together worked to defeat of racism". 
Students were victims of the precious rents - up to 900 euros for room 
The market for renting for university students know the crisis. 
According to recent research, Sunia, unions for tenants, rent a room may jednolůžkový student in Milan to 900 euros in Florence, 700 in Naples 650, in Rome, 600. 
"The phenomenon has reached such proportions that all the layers of students have lost the right to study for the sake of the overall too high prices, which would be their families have had to endure, says the head of the Office for the course of study, Sunia, Laura Mariani -- in this town of high demand from students zdeformovala market in such a way that fueled the rise in prices, which are rošířil and residenty." 
In most cases, the offer rents contain several offences: The contract free way nezaregistrované, without limitovaného rental, related podnájmy. 
There is a need for Sunji emergency action that might thanks to the revision of the taxes to regulate prices. 
If you look at the details of the research, we see that in Milan, in the field of Brianza, is the need for a single bed about 450 euros for jednolůžkový room, from the minimum price of 650 (zone Bande Nere) through the middle of the value of $800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) up to a maximum of 900 (in the zone of Vitoria). 
In Florence is one berth in an average of 350 / 400 euros, one room of about 700. 
In Bologna, where students is concentrated in the zones near the university, it is necessary to 250 / 280 euros for a berth in the dvojlůžkovém room, from 370 of up to 500 in jednolůžkovém. 
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, the piazza Bologna) want to roughly 600 euros for jednolůžkový room, 450 bed in dvojlůžkovém. 
Values are a little lower (550 euros for jednolůžkový) in the zones near to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Saving only if the přesuneme into the peripheral areas: 300 euros in bed and 450 for jednolůžkový room zones Prenestina, Centocelle, and the like. 
In Naples is behind the bed to be 300 / 450 euros, for the room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari want to bed of 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for jednolůžkový room. 
In the smaller towns prices are certainly less, but they have a greater impact on the economy of the people. 
In the cities like Perugia, where it is most common phenomenon rent for students from outside the European Union, is finally recorded one other anomalies: An increase in the roughly 25-30% of the fee, which they want foreign studentech, in comparison with the Italian. 
The old kinu sbohem Paradiso, the city of abolishing the historic theaters 
Kinematografické historic theaters are closing in favor of Multiplexu... 
"The city without the cinema is a blind, is like a face, eyes." 
The picture offered director Giuseppem Tornatorem successfully documents, what is happening in the big Italian urban centres, but also in rural městečkách. 
The process of reduction of cinema, the birth of a large multisálů in the suburbs and the following the demise of monosálů in central areas of cities, is one of the events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the marks of a genuine cultural crime. 
The historic site is often charged memories, "it is as if we lost the friend of the friend, with whom we shared the way a lot of emotion", the director of the new movie Paradiso onstage, the film, which 20 years before Tornatorovi won an Oscar and a jury in Cannes, and he told the poetry of one village cinemas and sadness because of a way of life, which is about cinema lost forever. 
The value obtained Anecem, the main association of operators, is clear: In the last five years, the traditional zavřelo 316 cinema of the tip, and the bill has killed in theaters in the most important cities: About 10 less in Florence, about 9 in Milaně in Naples, Bologna and Rome, and about 6 in Toríně, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most suffering uzavírkami is in the first place of Emilia-Romagna, the loss of 82 kinových glitz, followed by Toskánskem (44) and Lombardií (41). 
And the evidence that the first responsible for their disappearance of is the emergence of multiplexu, are these three Italian regions, which registered the highest number of new kinových multisálů: About 195 paintings in Lombardii in the past five years, 81, both in Tuscany, as well as in Emilia-Romagně. 
", a procedure he had developed neracionálně," says Paolo Protti, President Anecu, "it is useful to create a new structure, but it would need to guarantee that the existing survive because when one cinema in the town of closes, not all of its visitors are willing to jump into the multiplexu. 
Then nor nemluvme about the lack of a subsidy to the Fund in favour of: The previous government debt is about $10 million euros. 
From the point of view of the moral and ethical it is a shame that the government does not existing laws. 
To support the sector would need to be between 16 and 18 million euros a year ". 
An interesting is bolognský case, the first Italian city, which has a deal with uzavírkami and decided to find a way out of the protokulu between communities and Anecem, the first of this type in Italy for the protection and promotion of small cinemas in both historical centres, as well as in the suburbs. 
Among the scheduled standards are steps in tax cuts in favor of the operators and benefits for the audience as regards the mobility: Viewers will be able to lengths to Zone with capped services and will have a special prices to stop and on some of the parking lots. 
"I like this initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by the introduction of other measures". 
However, it is clear that in order to be able to stand up against the big power multiplexu, traditional theaters must improve the quality of the audio and video, because of today ’ s audience is demanding. 
The defense of the traditional movie is an issue which was for all important: The conclusion of the Super cinemas in Bagherii, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convincing to establish a "New cinema Paradiso", which I thought already 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when walking in front of the already closed Rialtem or Quirinalem Nazionale in the street, where I shared so many emotions that I had to look at the inscriptions black dust wheel on the other side of the.... 
The connection between politics and mafiánskou Group of the ‘ ndrangheta, the mayor Gioie Tauro in prison 
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the choice of the urban office in accordance with the interests of the mafia groups Piromalli." 
The charges, which the Directorate against the Mafia in a float against the mayor and vicestarostovi Gioie Tauro Giorgiovi Would Torrione e Rosariovi Schiavone, and the mayor Rosarna Carlu Martellimu, trapped miners was this morning due to external collaboration with mafiánskou organizations are heavy. 
In želízkách also Gioacchino Piromalli, old a mediator between klanem and public administration, and his grandson of a lawyer, jmenovec boss, who was accused of committing crimes mafia-type character, who was going to pay for the 10 million euros. 
"Ignoring all the legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," write the state representatives, when two local authorities have indicated a willingness to pay to consult a lawyer Piromallimu. 
"He would let the mafia group -- written by the judges -- officially enter the municipal offices and facilitate the already huge opportunities for control of the government." 
The President kalábrijské regional commission Agazio Loiero found that the "secret agreements between the local institutions and organized criminal networks podsvětím is in his county:" There are areas in which is the concentration of the mafia stronger than in the other, where the collusion of the inevitable. 
But there are also many local politicians, who have nátlakům 'ndranghety, heroes who are still untainted. " 
The incarceration of morning following the arrest in July of last year, which the police showed that mafiánská group Piromalli got the final action. 
Since the end of April last year - the city council Gioii Tauro was dissolved since 1991, the reason for this was that the link between organised crime, and the local administration - were local politicians are deprived of functions in the local administration. 
Giorgio Would Torrione, the chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the coalition of center - right after the close election in May. 
He said because of the scandal, when prefektura ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
Volal accountable then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minnitiho and accused him that encompassed everything from political reasons, but the judges in the Regulation of imprisonment, signed by the morning explain that mafiánská group has even went so far as to change the project Highway A3. 
On further questioning ordered against Would Torrionovi, written by public prosecutors, went clear 'willingness to move the rights of the proprietor, representatives of some of the larger group of very close to what is generally known Piromallimu and adapt to the choice of the public administration to the interests of the mafia groups. ".... 
When the energy would emerge from the waves, entering the game those large. 
It is the endless deposit, which covers more than 70% of the Earth 's surface, and now you are starting to appear much of the world's energy companies. 
The waves and currents, tides, the brains are new sources of infinite energy to visit sights behemoths like Chevron, who is now trying to reach out to these resources. 
The ability to create energy from the movements of the sea is studied more than 100 years old, and in the 1970's, in the context of the first oil crisis, the research zintenzivnil. 
Around 1980, when the price of oil has fallen, the idea for the use of marine energy, went to a party to the... But now environmental organizations and the new increase in the price of oil could be sector, a new impulse. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007, has said that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by using the motion of the waves of the seas. 
This would double the amount of energy, which is currently produced in nuclear centers. 
Moreover, there are even currents and the inflow and outflow. 
Giants attacks. 
SPOLEČNOST, which has committed itself to the sea power, was Enersis, which in 2005, agreed that will build the plant in northern Portugal. 
When it was announced that intention, looked at a huge revolutionary step. 
After two years, what is betting on a sea of energy, it is still more companies, betting on the sea power rather than on the energy of a traditional. 
"Chevron studying ocean energy technologies -- put it, a spokesman for one of the company, which is linked to the oil company in the United States in the economic daily newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, and thought about the possibility of having us." 
SPOLUPRÁCE, which do relates to obtain a permit from the US Commission on energy, which is necessary for the start of the project on the use of marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a signal we cannot be underestimated, especially when taking into account that the US in Alaska's oil and, more recently, President Bush came with a plan to new drilling. 
KROMĚ Chevronu watched the track of marine energy and Verdant Power Inc., in New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested money, even if they are to study known as observers of the growing interest in the show. 
The technology, 'needs to draw up. 
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in prvopočátcích, because he did not know what impact it will have the use of marine energy on the environment. 
Prozatím establishments in Portugal and one in Scotland are small dimensions, and it was that causing big problems of the ecosystem. 
For more energy production but is to use the technology with a larger impact on prosředí. 
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system, which are linked to one another. 
The force of the waves, which operates with buoys up and down, is amended, with the help of the cylinder and cylindrů on hydraulic pressure within these bójí. 
The pressure has fuelled an turbínu, which provides energy into the generator. 
Energy is coming to the bank of the submarine cables. 
Prozatím projects are in a phase of four devices of this type, which are waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for military purposes. 
On the contrary, Verdant Power now produces energy for buying - in the centre and the parking lot of the six pdmořských turbines in New York at the East River. 
The movement of water during the inflows and outflows causes the rotation of the turbines, which this otáčivým movement of live bivalve factory. 
Verdant is that they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorization for the use of this energy. 
After the waves, after the influx of and after the tide. 
A special interest in this moment deserving of potential inflows and outflows, say in the Institute for the Study of electrical power. 
Although it is a nesouvislý factor, inflows and outflows are more predictable than wind, sun or the waves, and hence even more reliable as a source of energy. 
PRÁVĚ into energy inflows and outflows states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, even with other coastal States have already invested $7 and a half milinonu in 2008 and předpověděly investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
