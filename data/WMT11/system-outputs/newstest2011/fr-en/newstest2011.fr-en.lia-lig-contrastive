That is what will happen? CSSD do or is Voldemort known Voldemort in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD at the town hall of the capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues in the ODSs.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new council members belonging to CSSD, in whether they know the argôt who was born in recent years at the town hall, when they were partners in the current coalition led in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the cream Prague policy initiated during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was surprised that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well the known terms.
So they say.
"" Is Valdemort ".
"I really do not know."
"I am a jeunôt in the policy pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to culture in a test of the vocabulary of" sponsor ".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression among those that you are proposing that I use"
Otherwise, I don not use the argôt.
Vocabulary, including the newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pré-éĺectoral seminar of the ODS, the writing has chosen 6 examples, particularly those associated with the mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf hole in Prague," go to the patisserie, "Sinews" beef "," betrayal of the capital "and" entôler ".
Three elected officials have been agreed to the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin view, which must lead education in Prague in the future - has promised first an interview but then did not pick up the telephone.
The Fifth Petr Dolinek has actually refused the test.
"I am not is no these things lá and how fun the representatives of democracy citoyenne: I will not my opinion."
"I am currently occupies the way we understand in the framework of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not recognize apparently in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing á' Kaucky and the only expression he had guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky immediately added: "but I know newspapers".
"I will have to pay a language course," jokes it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but Lukas Plachy, the elected to the environment, know that the hole in golf is the tunnel Blanko.
The two democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to go to find the character - he thinks the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"It is, I think, to go in a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the headquarters of Janousek.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather newspapers and not of any vocabulary that he would use.
According to the candidates to tests there is no argôt in the lexicon of social democracy.
"I took council with colleagues and it appears that we have really not something of this kind".
"It was rather the names some time using abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democrat Party, that members of the Party Hulda.
"I called Briza to school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this," says Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Papy is elected Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly Petit old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the small joujou".
Nicknames are also the only ones that work inside the party, the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky Hulda hear does not like much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for Prague this President.
"Doctorate in law," recalls allegedly that Petr Hulinsky received his Ph.D. in law JUDr.à the police academy in bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture "witches", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the women reported witches have common features.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, may not work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
That becomes "witch" is isolated in order not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely this destiny".
"We do not judge more young women in good health because they are at work and birth of children," said a sister who is in the capital of the West African countries, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this "social action" unusual.
He published a pamphlet which should help limit the witch-hunt.
The case involves a "problem".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the daily Die Standard about the disadvantage of Education in writing.
The accusations of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprayed.
It is the server of the BBC who passed this information.
The criminals claim that it was the evil eye.
In their version, the oil is used for ritual anointing emflammée is in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, apparently when the team wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The sealing-off "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a contractor 42 years of Burkina Faso: "the eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," he said.
While the Burkina Faso strives to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia no later than last year even saw the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad witch-hunt that apparently were involved in his death and reportedly sought by black magic to kill the President."
"The shamans Guinea close to come to the rescue, has led to the farm to Kanilai, under the protection of police and the President's personal guard, men and women selected at random dansdes villages of Gambia," said in a message "Amnesty International.
The firm people imprisoned had to drink a herbal potion to hallucinogenic effects that led in most other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
On international pressure that is about one thousand people who were released.
The Lessee of Bakal: the heat, he signed a higher rent.
An old man imposing came through the door of the centre clients of the society GPR Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He wore under his arm a record with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of her daughter and her son, who is now serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will pay from next year for an apartment 2 + 1 second category 4100.
"And there was no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," pointing the finger on the new contract of her son, the man who has the power to signature.
"But I signed when even" said t he explains to motié angry and resigned.
The association citoyenne apartments BytyOKD.cz who described the nouelles rental arrangements as "immoral and indecent," advised tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when will be issued a notice to explain the procedure for claim.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of hand.
"One said that, another said something else" the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, it expects most of the apartment in the Czech Republic, which rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory".
The waiting room of RPG in the street Havirovska is one of four the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Just beside the door is a guard of a security company with a device to draw customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the screen.
One pressure and a piece of paper with a number out of the aircraft.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your number is already beginning to light up on the big screen in the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second, it is your turn.
After a moment, an older couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not appear to relate to people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance and other developments.
In the region of Ostrava, people over 44000 apartments of the portfolio of GPR receive the letters with the new lease agreements in their box to letters since around mid-November.
RPG Byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for the new rent is open to the public since the 18 November.
"It works for nearly a week, so it is still in the testing," said after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client is presented as a journalist.
The déragulation and the former miners' apartments are a very sensitive.
The Vice-President of the parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of Social Democrats in reported fairly steadily before the elections and this is now the local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even have changed... n put a plate in the wc, relieves the man said.
However, it is mainly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised GPR in a special offers.
This is a discount of half the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires which have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the window "dérégulation" the street Havirovaska really is not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," said an employee at the wicket.
And yet GPR porpose both on its web site that in shop windows individual interviews on the leasings when it is necessary.
If the two sides do not agree on the rent that is an independent tribunal that makes the decision.
"It is not threats but only to inform on how unique and legitimate to act legally GPR, said on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" think one employées of GPR Byty and the man in the street outside the customer centre him.
"I have DKr 13.000 retirement and I have DKr 5000 to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"" We will see ".
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media requests that nobody sign and therefore the people are waiting," she said.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the start of 2011 and the increases, according to GPR Byty, is an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents do not always reach the level required for the simple maintenance of simple funds for housing," said Pavel Klimes, Director of residential portfolio of society GPR Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant in anger is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 GPR has been with rents invest in apartments 4 billion in four years from 2011 has 2014 that should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung from the ceiling in front of upholstered chairs of the waiting room of the Havirosvka Street, repeat, however, some information given in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and far less 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments of GPR".
"And this will always be the most 7.50 CZK the m2 per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 percent is 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases here, it is an increase of a sum very low CZK 19.66 at m2," adds GPR.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase but gradual on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money in the increase in rents (see chart) is rendered to apartments in the form of heating economies - new windows and heating.
Those who signed the agreement on the rent increase was the priority.
The kindergarten is part, too, offices have understood the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. design.
No one could have expected that also houses a mini nursery school with everything - the walls of colours, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, can make children of employees of Arch. design.
The society of projets-architectonique Arch. design. including the workshops have produced a large number of construction in Brno, has imagined his mini nursery school of business since the first drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age to make children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time as employment contracts in time declined, nursery school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by society Arch. design. as part of its social agenda.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a job taking with the care for the children.
It is the employees of Arch.Design.eux-mêmes who have imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded by the means the European Social Fund through the operational program of Human Resources and State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (up to 2.8 mil.de CZK). they were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure qualified staff and the start.
After the use of the allocation of funding (two years) the company Arch. design. has an obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is society Economy nominale who has helped to make the request of staffing.
The children's care is provided by a qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher caring children. children can go to nursery school without age limit, but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who will replace.
The functioning of the school is responsive to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although agise of a care and individual education, the programme of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children are no that play, but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the prep school to teach English.
The class is equipped not only of toys and games imaginative but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can at any time controlling their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up children in a school far from the workplace of parents.
Parents use their time to work on the most productive way.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between employer and employee.
Arch.Design.s' is listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees, and who are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces the HR marketing.
The house still fascinates bones after 100 years. take a look in the interiors of Gaudf.
The roof looks like the back of a saurien, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to fish Gules.
Thus is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona from the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname of Maison bone.
Organic shapes, colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, housefront recalling the scales and around these curves, this is everything ypique for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house held its lines of dream, its colours and textures pleasant reminiscent of the nature and animals.
In a more detailed comment is the geometry, pace and order thought with precision.
On the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brilliance of colours is strengthened.
Leafroll and the twist of the forms also appears in the interiors with the same extent.
The copy in waves the wood window frames, balustrades, the elements of the doors, the oeilleton and lamellae.
The Battlo house that sits in the Eixample district in the market Street Passeig de Gracia to number 43, was born of the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction has made for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, was first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another any new but quickly accepted the idea of a reconstruction Gaudf unusual and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as home to multiple units was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that are born decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque to the facade.
The housefront also worked for other artists and creators.
The plans for the joint work of the house, Casa Battlo began with a believe cooperation between Jujol and Gaudf.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudf Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudf.
Locals have nicknamed the hot house just after finishing his because of its organic forms the bone "bone."
Others, with regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows were known as "the house that drink".
It said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden.
Gaudf a thought for the house a single system in his time, with central heating vents and chimneys typical.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the establishment Gaudf did not comply with the guidelines of construction and has not been hampered by them.
At the beginning of the building he received on the part of the city the building permits, knowing, of course that the data reported on the reconstruction plans were so vague that during the two years after finishing the City Council was horrified and asked for changes.
It wasn't happy, for example, to members of the city council that the pillars of the construction empiettent public on the sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep Battlo asked (and satisfaction) got approval to rent the top two floors.
The Owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common lounge and the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The full house of six floors is shared by a staircase by which you climb up to a roof terrace independent.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by walls curves.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of the bond spaces.
The party may be related completely by opening the doors of high society and salons can communicate comfortably or to limit the private space for interviews, more intimate.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudf received a new addition housefronts toîture nontrad 2-storey and in more.
The Gaudf game with the light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles, which is decorated with the inner courtyard and with the wells of lights.
The game in two colours give a maximum of light in all the floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than the dark who instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Battlo which was included in the 2005 World Heritage Fund UNESCO perhaps visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the apartment the more spacious and the splendid more accessible to the public.
The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they have found that it is a lucrative business and they have broadened the scope of visits to common spaces and the attic including the roof terraces.
The ticket in the monument is not really expensive and costs €16.50; students, pensioners, the groups and the tourist card holders have 20 per cent discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into the other buildings in the city of Gaudf.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you have to quickly find a comrade among residents of the building and visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a bedspring: women have other criteria than men.
No conspicuous framework, but the quality of the surface reserved at bedtime, so the mattress and the bedspring give a real basis for a good bed.
They must naturally complement harmoniously to appeal to a specific user.
During the election, several things are crucial: the weight, size, age, health status, and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which it will place the mattress and the bedspring is also important.
A a typical example?
For example, in the cottage where we do not continuously dort latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warming" gently.
They have, moreover, a weight above the polyurethane mattress 59-65.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the heart and if they are, in addition, on a strong board, they retain moisture. mold can also be formed.
The habit is also decisive in the election.
That is the clear time abroad, where it often uses mattresses very thick with a layer rammollissante, feels hardly feel well on a low, hard surface.
"It is as well that all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there".
"To their shoulders, legs and ribs, they needed mattress with a layer of foam rammollisante lazy".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder therefore assume evil" information "joints and the skin," says Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the foam mattress with lazy conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Today everything is working well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but Czech Tropico have, for example, appropriate mattresses.
You do not need to be a gars of NHL to assess a foam lazy.
The "miracle" just works.
It optimalise its rigidity and its form under the heat absorbed or adapt to the heat of your body.
There is pressure on you and you do not back in the game after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
The foam lazy also functions as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of mattress, depending on your size, add the length of feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman a size of 180cm have therefore need a bed of 210 / 220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm in total 180 cm.
For beds in a single place, the singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient to visit.
"However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on their backs you should ask the hands comfortably with elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who has spent several years on the issue of a healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture and Enseign in special schools.
For a bed to two seats each needs its own bedspring and mattresses, so attention during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will remain to mount the bedspring at different heights and this is not feasible on all the bed.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattress springs at least 15 cm, this count for the layer of form and venting at least three centimetres.
"To touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each type request a mattresses type of mattress support.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and the bedspring are united as sisters siamoises, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress has aèrent very badly; it should not wash, which is commonly auhourd' today.
And since during the night you perspire normally 0.2. 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress is beginning to remind a large (and clogged round-holed).
To this specialists refuse to make the claims on a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life.
But his but.
And for this a board of experience on the part of sellers: for a mattress 120 / 140cm, give up, for the mattress cover, hygiene or washing but add rather a mattress of protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole thing, it is to say that after the opening it was two parties (for washing and the size of the washing machine that is very important!) if not manipulation for the larger models (and for a single person) becomes when removes a fight between a light weight and a lorry on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid instead of a collapsed?
Never!
The maximum for visitors for a bed for a single night.
However equip the board (if there are no vents) and use the mattress springs with a minimum height with springs 15cm bags (Germany) and a layer of Taschenfederken bioventing.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For the lamellae box to unique position with 14 / 18 lamellae, the so-called latex mattresses or sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but this will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellae, 28 and above, where the lamellae are doubled in the bottom half of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For mattresses at several positions it should not take mattress springs because it does not meet the change of position.
Next to the setting of the rigidity of lamellae can also install what is known as a cradle of shoulder.
It is a special liaison lamellae that can put pressure or even tilt the coverslip for Dungeness the shoulder "fit" well.
For men who have the "broadest shoulders back," this is really important.
This thing is already being considered by the mattress manufacturers for the "male" began to use a zone rammollissante across the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer a softer surface again at the hips.
For the customer the more difficult client there are wing box or platelets with a so-called Ineligibility multiforce.
The pressure is spreading in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattress and sleeping, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a pillow simple: the pillow must support the head and its spines should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
Size is the size recommended that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When you are lying on the side, the pillow needs to upgrade (with the cradle of shoulder or the rammollie deck area in the mattress) the shoulders.
The modern mattress still have something in common with the first basis of straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also the organic mattress convet.
The raw materials bean-derived pétrôle, from which it manufactures polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use justement soybeans.
"The qualifier Bio for mattresses means that the heart is manufactured using natural products," said Petr vasicek Tropico society Plus.
The natural materials are also used in coatings mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add that develop micro-capsules scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the excerpt from birch for the mattress cover absorbs heat and cooling the body, "cools" man, coatings "heat" women.
The extract of red pepper accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore more warm to the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
The foam mattresses made from cold (it is more pores with a breathable more disrupted cellular structure so that the standard polyurethane and more elastic.
The combination of different stiffnesses gives cold foam mattresses polyzones who know precisely where is the head, the lower back and feet.
You will pay a mattress of quality from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health are less VAT and are taken as tools to health.
In the Czech Republic is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Save for the mattress and the sleeping is not simple.
We may from time to time have in the context of special actions on the part of producers mattress manufacturers or two for the price of one.
For example, the company, which offers Duofreeze Magniflex mattresses Duofreeze with the memory foam sewn to the coating 11990 for koruny.
Obviously you can take the second free of charge.
The era of mosses lazy viscoelastic or with an open cell structure and a great depth was initiated with the material Tempur to a cosmic "pace".
It started as a subject for NASA astronauts were at the start of the huge load factors.
The Tempur rammollit to heat and hardens, on the contrary, cold.
It adapts perfectly to human body and distributes an optimum pressure.
It is ideal for this against evil slept and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic mosses are used not only for the mattress, but also for products to health, as the special cushions for the feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC foam or Twinsaver or of the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly demanded by parents who wish to monitor their children.
The fear for their child brings more people to think about the monitor through a GPS.
The system, introduced early to seek the cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as that of the small exmple Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a shows.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to say to all people that this is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr Pilin society MAcro Weil which is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases".
"The majority of people are really customers who buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin.
He said children should always know what purpose is used "the box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, drew attention if the child does not want to wear on him something of this type, it débarassera.
"And even the smallest may show a great creativity when it comes to express get rid of something when they do not want to be under control".
"The phones, which can be cut as these devices tracing, parents have already led to long delays," says Bockova.
In it, the fact that this type of device could help in the case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it's a kidnapping prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child had no electronic device that can locate him".
"Currently, it is the phone".
"As soon as will develop the tracing, they (criminals) are the seek the because of the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of society RC Monitoring, which proposes tracing service both for cars for people, says that to have this type of device can help, even if it was destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The device can be parameterized such that it is in regular issue after a fixed period".
"In the event that the aircraft is destroyed, it's still the last position of the person concerned".
"The more expensive devices also have a point tiltmeter immediately the position of the person who has slipped and is found by lying down without moving," said Cech.
He said the so-called smart phones equipped with a navigation system, can offer a similar service after formatted with a special prologiciel.
The problem of current systems for tracking is that it is either a device similar to the ones they wear in Necklet, the size of a box of matches is the smaller phone devices.
You can always lose.
According to Pilina of society Macro WEIL, which is why the tests are being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not recognize the tracing system".
"Or it will account after a certain time, which would have given the police a little more time," he adds.
That the tracing system is developed in the form of bracelet necklet or utilisiera, it always the same technology as charting cars.
It is a combination of systems acquisition of a position via GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone service that will alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has both detonating cords that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with. but it can take two years.
The army has bought to 445 km of detonating used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The Army has reserves to 225 years.
The problem is that the life of detonating is two to four years.
The army has bought detonating cord to the company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff has given as a result of the achât of an enormous amount of detonating cord to FPs DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of reservation to hold made by the pyrotechniciens of the army, that FPs DNES contacted, it shows that even the generals, the officers with a command, secretaries or the household staff should have each year an exercise to explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the Army of 60 km of detonating cord.
At this distance is DH25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army could provide for 10 years.
If it is true that the basic training for each new professionals more than 2 m detonating cord, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase assured - with also the use of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers in the brigade of early intervention have recently complained to the Minister Vondra they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that the shooting sessions are limited because of the needs of money.
About the lack of underwear we do not talk about.
"And I don't take myself the head if they buy from us so much detonating cord".
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing".
"For us the army is a good customer that we are working as traders to please," said the commercial manager of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argues the achât of hundreds of km detonating cords, by the fact that the Army will these "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reported however only four years of life of detonating cord and the pyrotechniciens of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it may go even up to four years", said one who does not want his name be published given the criticism of the army.
The period of life of past, each item must be tested to see if it remains Integrates and threaten the soldier's life.
These tests, however, are not free and cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the quantity to 445 km of detonating cordeux.
"They have claimed 60 percent less than the provision of the past year 245km," says the spokesman Pejsek who has an interpreter of the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cord of pyrotechniciens of the police that neutralize ammunition of the second world war or even those after the Soviet army, does not exceed the 1500-metre.
And the police still control only the amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for security reasons of pyrotechniciens and to be able to obtain a more flexible types of detonating cords, more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence today has big problems for the disposal of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak Army strong two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, focus on the Rhine.
This waiting in a few years the Czech army that FPs DNES contacted: defeating hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
Until today I take advantage of contacts that I obtained through the competition.
The sale of its hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, entrepreneur 28 years.
His adventure to the adventure is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec it lacked a hosting site quality at a reasonable price.
Its savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan it has bought a small building five apartments in half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of graduate school, it was a brave action.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began the first apartment was rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his action of contractor enabled him to open to Libérec 4 pensions style, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it came another identical quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of candour and other candidates to the franchise hotels Pytloun have shown", the number 1 contractors last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a hotel on a large scale the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory provided more than popularity and be seen to Libérec and its environs.
"People recognize me in the street, often welcomed me and, I must say, that it was very enjoyable," he recalls.
It recommends the participation in the competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses until now his contacts and knowledge that he could not get another way.
"With those I met with the help I started about trading regularly.
According to him, the renowned linked the success also had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I see among them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been generally acknowledged."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my work, but the result of a good job of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the Farmet winner has the worst moments behind.
The one that got the price to Slovansky dum for first place in the competition for the Firme of the year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The board has rewarded the effort with which he transformed a workshop of tools to Ceska Skalice in a firm turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to combat the competition", said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of their property by the Communists, it has not hesitated long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a society with a few comrades in the entourage of his father in the manufacture of plastic tubs.
Not very long after they began to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
The company has been known even in the non-specialized audience after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to really better brand awareness Farmet but also foreign partners that have begun to realise that they were collaborating with a company that has received the most success in his country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year e not has not risen to Farmet only established the euphoria of victory.
The valuation of the company had been made from the economic performance of 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 and it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to halt their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts new materials and technologies.
"We have not escaped, of course, this situation".
"The turnover fell by 40 per cent, and we had to limit our production and even dismiss," said Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society must know that from time to time we must take unpopular measures.
But they have managed the situation correctly and have retained recipients results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with endowments a training and research centre, have strengthened the presentation of the society in salons-expositions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires back and with them the number of employees.
"The new winner I hope this nice feeling of victory but in a calm," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation, which removes senseless regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdité of the year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The little glorieux winner this year of the survey on the Absurdité of the year was the obligation to make in the offices of documents that officials can get online.
More than one-third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the administrations of Social Affairs paper asked an extract of the commercial register while the employee can get in two clicks of a mouse.
Things change thanks to the investigation.
"The administration of the Czech Social Insurance will ask more the extract from the register of trade for controls of insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Administration of social insurance (CSSZ).
Highlighting all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must meet in the Czech Republic and eliminate those that are absurd is the meaning of this competition the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time part of business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny Hospodarske and has even greater popularity.
If the last year 3,000 voting occurred, it is at least 4,000 this year who have made their voices.
Not surprisingly, it is the most diverse countries in our legal obligations that do that curb the company, and that, this.
"We may be the number of paperwork for the tax returns for the top places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is to the 74 th place regarding the conditions for the company, or 8 places more compared to last year.
The support of the Absurdité of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006, and continues each year by the same scenario.
Anyone can do state each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to late September deadline before the close of the competition.
To reflect this ya the website www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdité that received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is a hundred or more exactly 105 regulations and décrêts who have lost their meaning of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, thus among the nominees is by example the requirement that the maintenance vehicles highways and expressways pay tolls, or that the contractors with 20 employees, repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a regular happening involving figures from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises of Czech Republic or well Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Czech Republic, attended at the height of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot function when the state puts âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to remove, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business, "said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd décrêts is not an empty gesture.
In 2007, which was not welcomed people was the obligation of contractors to declare three days before the office to individual enterprise to the location of the company, the intention of going to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was removed with the ammendement of the Act on the individual.
The second requirement the most popular in 2007, which was to declare to the Office of the work a service for a foreign employee in 30 days, was removed with the text of the Act on the so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdité of the year 2009 was the Order to physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their offices, a refrigerator and two automatic weigh-scales.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health the year dernière-l' obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category award socially responsible firms.

The novelty of this year the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which already exists for five years, is the group known as the Firme Responsable of the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is supporting the reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator Vodafone, the firm, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the competition for the rebelle of the year.
For this first year of this subset of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, have registered companies that do not have success with a single long-term target for the company.
The adventure of each of these is full of inspiration and independent an article to publishing.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another may be considered their support activity and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns the disabled and the personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the entire Czech Republic is not example prologiciels Society pragoise And Netera that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who take part in number of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of Pardubice Isolit-Bravo is the company that has 17 years the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities.

In Olomouc is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing more flexible working hours and even declined to 35 hours per week on average, and this without, proportionally, cutting wages.
The Board will déverné the title also because it achête priority in the Czech, supports a ditoyenne activity in the immediate environment and cares about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible for our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the Executive Director of the society.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit the Région of Ústi also think the health of its employees and their established for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the services of catering to a local protected plant for his actions.

The Lands Fund in Plzen, police have made arrests in a public competition
In the building of the Lands Fund in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The détectives was handcuffed to the local contractor and real estate Lubos G.
He had tried to manipulate precisely a public tender for the settlement of a restitution claim so that the ground was achieved through proposed PRISOnS.
It should pay to Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are still a person for insider trading in the bidding and a public concour." said to the newspaper Pravo the leader of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more information because the investigation is ongoing.
The officers released after 24 hours that contractor to 46 years in prison.
To see how it could affect a public competition, we can only speculate given the little official information.
To a question of Pravo, the spokesman for the Terrains Fund Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen on a separate workplace, and this, during the open competition.
"It was a client, and in any case of an employee, she said.
The competition public on Cerna is as true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the land" and put in place when several candidates are beneficiaries of law.
"These people have, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be resolved before being announced the value of the land".
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of purchasers is put in place and the Terrains Fund then transfers the ground to the person who suggested the rights the highest," said the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about people who had registered to the appeal and as it is itself, also a person, are having bought a large number of rights for refunds, it had proposed to the candidates at the ground not to participate in the competition.
He cashed and perhaps by the fact to withdraw.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the FdT standards Fund (Terrains).
It appeared in the case of the former Head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted criminally for edit land for which it had already edited the initiation of a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place that would be built the artery of'accés in the industrial area of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged with the town hall to a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far greater.
The town hall was obliged to accept because it might put at risk by a construction freeze on land.
Households will pay a supplement of a 100 crowns monthly for housing.
Households will from January pay a supplement, not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, supplies of heating and in some places the rents also increase.
Families will therefore from January draw from their wallets until 100 monthly more than now.
The electricity rises of 4.6 percent, the gas almost 2 per cent more expensive in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth of the provision of water and in many places the central heating supplies will be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should approach for households in an apartment the 100 anuellement more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including batteries photovoltaÏques.
The gas is rising moderately but of course when people need it the most to heat and therefore have a greater consumption.
Therefore, it can also a hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas increase across the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the most common major planning the price increases.
For example households to Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay in January for central heating DKr almost 50 more per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1,000 EEK annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the case in which the city is rising rents infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a supplement to 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still among the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
The rents will rise by example significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments in January that is to say at the end of regulation.
For example, the company that owns Byty ICC to Usti nad Labem almost 2,500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 per cent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Rent regulated that people pay in almost 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children are saoûlent in the rum fernet. the beer is no longer mode and is gently.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptional way also the best marks of whisky are stolen to parents.
There are drinks that bring the most often those saoûlent, who have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the experience of doctors who face similar cases to hospital admissions of children hospitals.
"The beers and wines are no longer way because it takes time to be saoûl."
"The trend is really the spirits," said for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of Department children Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to vines a bottle to Dad in the cupboard, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka prevailing '.
"The vodka has the advantage that they can be mixed with fruit juice and thus not the feel," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the hospital Motol, also gives it right.
"In general, it is rum or fernet".
"Today is the alcohol fashionable particularly in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was that they have reduced slivovice of the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, see drunken children aged 13 to 14 years hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working at Horovice since last year, it was Motol where he held 10 years justement pediatrics where ambulances'écoliers brought large drunken.
"A young girl was hospitalized and four times
"It acommencé his career in 12 years when she was taken with 3.5 per 1,000 blood alcohol in with a mixture with ecstasy", described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice to a party".
"What is interesting is that it does not bizarre to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours" said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the selflessness of parents or their extraordinary tolerance with the fact that their offspring engage in the drink which are the main cause of développment alcohol abuse of children.
According to experts, this is not of addiction, in the strict sense, for the children.
"Under the term is a chronic alcohol addiction to alcohol for several years with all the resulting phenomena but that are not found in children".
"Among those who use the repeatedly methanol, rather it is a significantly unfavourable back-ground socio-familial," explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about 40 children have been hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic pediatrics at Motol.
Are integrated into the stastistiques that the case with a serious illness requiring hospitalization.
Children who are drunk after emergency care brought home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which it can count: the day of witches, the saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by spite after poor results or, instead they are celebrating the start of the holiday".
"Of course I lived in the day witches an admission of 7 children drunk at a stroke," said Pélikan.
The child drunk who spent the night in hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is ironically in a better position than returned home and suffering the aftermath of the hangover.
The headaches of morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are better off for it as they spend a great evening and a sweet réveil and nothing their hurts".
"They are only surprised of where they are," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time this striker the good humour of patients at least with the notes to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospital intensive care bed up to tens of thousands of wreaths.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education in cash to these children how much their drunkenness has cost, and they could take over the summer by seasonal work to repay a single evening Pélikan," added.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover on the part of parents charges related to care, do not treat cases of children drunk.
Two aircraft L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159 of five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of aircraft Casa-EADS.
It is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad during exercises or demonstration flights.
It is two-seaters versions of which were until now in service in the Czech army and were flying.
Lestrois remaining aircraft are single-seater aircraft versions of L-159.
They stand at the moment and intermediate in Aéro Vodochody commercial Omnipol - the firm - the took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the departure of physical Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were taken on had stored for a long time without cause or cause additional investments for the Ministry of Defence ".
"The Q1 L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
He said that the army will not two-seater without because the department signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth $200 million kroner for the transformation of four single-seater L-159 two-seaters unused in two.
The army has taken delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second scheduled for delivery by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft in equipment to a number of NATO countries.
"In the contract it is clear that takes into account the aircraft L-159 is EADS and that they will be used to training pilots of NATO countries".
"It is therefore the case that takes into account how to achieve that," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other planes to 3.5 billion kr was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched bidding and contacted directly EADS.
The management of Defense having a dispute while the exchange is a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aéro Vodochody 72 apparatus and uses that 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will probably have legal implications.
The European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a bid to the European level and never by directly contacting the manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three aircraft Casa, the latter should arrive in Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
An index that the index rim-fire is a sign of low risk cancer
Men who have the longer than the index rim-fire are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British journal Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings suggest that the length of the finger is a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, including for men before 60 years," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Research on the cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men should undergo testing for prostate cancer, including by combining with the genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors such as family health antécedents, added Eeles.
During the period of 1994-2009 she followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the ring.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, it was found the same likelihood of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index that the longer rim-fire the risk is, however, dropped to 33 per cent for men before 60 years the reduction of risk has risen to 87 percent.
The report by length of two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - shows including different levels of sex hormones facing the child in the womb.
Unless an index more testosterone is longer.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone, which is helping to develop prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla, Erstaunen Paces Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said to KTC that he is aware of this study but that he did not think, supposedly, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer was "completely demonstrated".

The Americans have a new "weapon intelligent"
The U.S. military sent in Afghnistan a new weapon "smart", known only by the codename XM-25.

The new weapon is like a cannon super
The projectiles are guided by with a laser accuracy to within a few metres.
The special calibre ammunition 25-mm developed for the rifle and containing an explosive highly breaking, works in fact as small grenades.
You can program the ammunition so that they will soar in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So you can use it against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected from above and when it comes to top a deadly rain steel, that can disable also.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapons that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier is used mainly in such a way that he found the target, sends a laser that determines the distance, gives a specific aim point that it corrects his referred site and pulls the trigger.
"Let's say you have referred to 543 metres".
"When you press the trigger, the weapon is responsible and draws to the distance of 543 metres plus or minus 1, 2, 3 metres, Audette.
400 Jobs delocalized
The Group Fujitsu relocate its subsidiary of Bad Homburg.
Next year in July, 400 staff will transfer to Astro Park their place of work that is currently in the office building of the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocate its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the giant said Wednesday the specializing in the manufacture and the maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace 400 men and women, located so far on the place Marienbader of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, huge office complex located on the street Lyoner Straße du Quartier Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term, the group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The supply of rental was extremely attractive. in addition, the offices to open area of Astro Park are better suited to working mode of collaborators.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The general manager, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad presents us with a central location with a remarkable infrastructure".
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance to a comprehensive business as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region has sparked yesterday the joy of disappointment caused the winners and losers.
The head of Economic Affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary" profession of faith on location ".
Fujitsu is to the city and its'implantation is a major boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very soon informed the Municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this business," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons have been decisive.
It is now prevent a place so exceptional remains vacant for long.
"I hope that the owner and Lessor of the building will be coopératif."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by the company Fujitsu and the "small vertical" neighbour, as well as the rest of the buildings on Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
Result of a joint project of the municipality and a developer of private projects, a new entrance to the city was established between the station and the Town Hall, which drew widespread criticism, not only because of the impressive'aménagement surfaces that were formerly part of parking, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company rating and investment advice, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for the travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, The German group of specialized Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen repurchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu in the same time as the property fund Morgan Stanley. a year later, these buildings were sold to Spanish society Falcon Real Estate Investments SA, based in Madrid.
The group Fujitsu headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the third largest provider of IT products in the world.
For example, it puts computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region of is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly far more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle at Frankfurt-Niederrad. other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services, and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square metres have hired in the property Astro Park.
This complex of 20 years old, whose name recalls his plan in the form of star, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Industry électronique and electrotechnology.
'expulsion Of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is it increasingly difficult.
The Internet Service Provider Amazon has removed from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude cache perhaps political pressure suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the website Wikileaks is attacked with more force.
The group of cyber-activistes "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted up here in America and in Europe is now seeking an ISP.
Meanwhile, the leading US Senator Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," reported Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activistes to the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Recently, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes have used the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "great, our dollars are being spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The television channel CNN, citing the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks to use its servers after an investigation by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott against her, told the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked that Amazon takes the measure earlier given the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said Senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to deny the use of servers for the platform.
"Wikileaks is illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. in doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endanger the lives around the world," according to a news release from the senators independent.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should assist Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the documents stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, appears on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper The Independent "," the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is found.
The cyber-activiste has consistently described intrigues orchestrated by its detractors prosecutions against him by Sweden.
The spokesman for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Clearly Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the Republican former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks is prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Head of Government Mr. harper said on television, clearly so ironic, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, an argument broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and disclosed recently, to engage in espionage.
"I do not know exactly why we must take care of the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," said Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The US government is now completely test-bench the protection of its databases.
According to a press release from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre for the fight against terrorism, has been appointed leader to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for setting up the necessary structural reforms "made necessary after the disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to address the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to contact with them," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it proves necessary."
The the University of The Ice
"University" of Bologna, it prepares the confectioners of ice the best seasons of the year.
The three-day training course held for the future of glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
In fact, where does all the ice?
The Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e., in German, the confectioner somewhat dated, ice cream factory in all the rules of Italian art of making the ice.
The turbine to remove ice cream of ice chilled using a spatula, available in the the waffle and then began to sell it.
To find out, there was no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the Province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the ice cream out of its machines across the Italian ideals are high.
The three-day training course held for the future of glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also available on the ice of chocolate and extending over several days, the practice sessions are held in the glacerie private.
Fully in midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their ardent desire on the ice smooth.
This time, it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia from Hungary.
Jacky, professor of education artistique come to California is a man of the Slow Food movement. it is to propose to the future a European product quality at countries of the Glace industrielle.
Anke of Berlin is a business management and it wants, after a few years, draw some strange thing of this trade experiencing nervine.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another time Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the wife of Canadian household came because his children love the Italian ice cream.
The Master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explained participants the perfect ideal of perfect ice.
Is crucial not only the good flavour, but also the flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano remember during the training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "the Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacrée dose of romanticism."
The first step in the production seems quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and Stabilizers in a large heat all to 85 degrees through a e-program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a tap installed on the machine: it fate a basic white cream pasteurisée, basis for all sorts of ice to milk.
The trainer was immediately deluged with question: is it possible to manufacture the ice using only natural substances without?
How can we give free rein to the pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano cautions to be misled by the spirit of the times.
That only speaks of ice "made from natural ingredients," perhaps nevertheless used Stabilizers: the more often a natural product, for example flour guar seed obtained from the guar Bean.
It is of course possible to manufacture the ice without using a stabilizer only must sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client croquera does nothing other than ice pellets.
Some changes of the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavouring.
The Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that it acquires in the fruit or radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there are the powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will try all of you passing dozens of aromatised ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
In the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the cream made from the mass of white base, adding eggs becomes a yellow cream is, and when you add the cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts.
Now, all participants must switch to use ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to produce four kinds of ice: in vanilla, chocolate and hazelnut moka in the with or without eggs in the mass of base, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the perspective of taste, it is not absolutely best.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The ice in kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizing.
"Only a balanced mix properly is the taste of a lens," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: if one uses the fishing purée with a lot of sugar, it is that the amount of sugar is reduced in the basic recipe.
Extra sugar is necessary for the lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the vine-growers are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the Tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, all physical intervention.
It is not just the automatic machine of the basic mass support.
There is also a device in which it fighting at the mixture of ice available to the buttery make and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automatisations, légères breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barbouille of fruit purée from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes.
The master Luciano believes that "an incident like this could happen in every way: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimented with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has hijacked the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the implications of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we well informed," said on Wednesday at Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports that the president of the group of experts Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked a critical role in the development of test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticism by Mr. Then.
The requirements are verbatim, developed by subparagraphs, the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma in Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech denounced a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of the Efsa has recently joined unconditionally or without transitional period the Swiss food group Syngenta. in doing so, She has changed sides.
There is little time, even the Radio Central Germany Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union monitors and the industrial lobby, which has aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency that MEPs.
However, the Efsa admits the existence of no conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it operates all reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of good quality.
It does not prohibit experts working for the Efsa to establish contacts with the industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he worked for the International Institute for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The agency sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong to, among others, the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr Then disapprove of the fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without any testing of food in animals and that it was not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize field cause," says Mr Then.
The current practice is to test only the proteins isolated and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not obtain reliable results.
"If we do not seek the risks, how can we discover them?" asked Mr. Then on an accusatory tone.
It is also the view of Ms. Hilbeck.
This scientifique conducts research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic of Zurich.
In this area, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
That is why there is barely even researchers who are not related to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry contrôle Security Research".
The record of pierre
Uli Gsell has provided a total of about 400 kg.
On Monday afternoon, she was at the station of Stuttgart with a tube in the back.
There there were
- It it.
History is known: in September, the excavators came and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the central station Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the shutdown of construction.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (limestone) of shellfish Crailsheim tendre and coarse-mesh, a poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years living in Osifildern.
It was purchased a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They shall not disappear."
He said with enthusiasm: "a small and cheap, simple and land."
It claiming that in the cutting in the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet clear what they will make of the fragment.
The rocks have Time.
Uli Gsell too.
In the footsteps of Stuttgart stones lead to a former munitions depot in the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire stones.
This man is 44 years old stone trade.
He bought all the stones from the demolition occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the landfill," he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he had been the subject of insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing of the demolition company.
But it has been negotiating for days with opponents of the project S21.
And he explained that he could not do anything at all to oppose demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 were subsequently won a stone parallelepiped weighing an average of 80 kilos whose value is between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while hoping also to make it during reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still squeezed in the forest, the rest having long since sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came across and took away everything that could go into the trunk and trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart have long down-blended "Mäuerle" or limitations patches of grass.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" said Dr. Rongen.
"This political component."
He enters its coach-and-four, made the turn its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law that he has abandoned. later, he began to study biology before looking on to the computer and eventually become a carrier.
And an amateur stones.
It stores 40,000 tonnes.
He amassed wealth everywhere in Germany.
ILs says it is the largest dealer of ancient stones.
It is réfrène.
With stones carved sand art are posed on the snow.
"Previously, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, Yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"" My favourite Stone. "
It takes the road that rises through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre de red sand, previously part of the station of Karlsruhe.
And and so on.
"" "". "" Joli
The parallelepiped was once part of the rostrum of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Across the snow stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police, the granite reddish-violet from the cathedral, the St Blasien sinters from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen think that once the stones were carved by hand and displaced using simple hoists and carts drawn by horse, it becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into play."
It did not become rich, even less millionaire.
But the carrier now employs 14 people. in addition, tailors stones, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a gardener and a glass blower settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the recycler waste.
Soon, he must travel to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Fight to win the talent potential Senior
The desk is great influx.
16 Students are to buy bread rolls to salmon rolls, tomato sauce and blancs-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
In the context of a sort of competition of ideas, they must speak profession about the car of the future with the developers of VW, and, by the way, knowing the firm Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in competition to find the best brains and engage, as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the brightest graduates as much as possible in the halls before they enter the labour market and they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, trying to identify the exceptional talent in the projects of the practices and loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talent.
A young lady of personal service shared the pens, candy and maps with the logo of Volkswagen.
She spoke of the calendar of vocational courses and jobs students to young talent; it shows the paths for access to the grounds of the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is in charge of the project started with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "students come into contact with the industrial sector and gain experience."
"The Volkswagen group, it may hear students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Chump, Such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"Previously, the focus was more on the professional project,", says Mr Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their collaborators sorting through a on a host of candidates.
But they must strut their reliability and woo the highly skilled labour.
It is mainly graduates from lines of engineering graduates who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to forecasts by the VDI, a vacuum on the engineering positions will expand again.
Dykta goes hunting talents on behalf of audit firm KPMG, accounting and Council.
It organizes costly events intended to recruit talent, such as the race Croisière KPMG-Race, a species of rallye-papier where competitors must find their way to the help of GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to walk this way the United States.
Participants can also visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and about the company.
That must participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch through the race cruise."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the Hunter of talent that is Mr. Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are on the verge of complete their studies and soon wish to send their requests for our business". "he says.
Outside the Direct amadouement in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are quite classic in participating in the trade fairs where they are engaged in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve graduates in participating in the shows."
"For example, the lounge of solar technologies," says Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company based in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problems linked to the succession.
Currently, 35 posts are to be filled on the site of the company.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is expensive and time-consuming," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld established cooperation with various institutions of higher learning, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of traineeships professionnels or write his draft end of study in us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced in the Solar specialists.
That is why the company tries to its advertisement highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do that," said Ms. Stübe, Chief of Staff.
A long time ago that money is no longer the main role in the search for employment.
The flexible working hours, custody of children or good opportunities for promotion are other factors.
According to a study by the institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employers to Germany.
The institute is a roll of honour annuel for German employers.
To that end, he asked the collaborators on their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while watching the conditions of employees.
The Chief of staff Dr. Stübe hope that this investment will enhance the image of the company to job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly on external assessments regarding a potential employer", "she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademle, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make attractive is through its own aides," he said.
It is, according to the jargon in the sector, the strategy of internal image, i.e., the creation of the image of the employer within its own workforce.
"The staff are the best Messengers."
When dealing well its employees and that they identify with the company, they alone advertising on their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if one was playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama is a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida State of the southeastern United States, in years to come.
The government of Washington delivered a ban A ban and, thus, definitely rescinded its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic Coast, new remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon "who is at the root of this strict prohibition. it should remain in force at least for the next five years.
In response to the accident that claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, had indicated that he was willing to allow the completion of new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this approach want to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries for oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of several billion, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of drilling imposed after the explosion of the platform.
Following the decision, other oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and tougher safety briefings, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent authority, which was discredited after widespread allegations of corruption, is currently the subject of deep reforms.
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama announced the would remove the the lucrative oil and gas groups.
The players in this industry are now publicly warn that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case at present.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" as the result of a current survey carried out in the area by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterized the sector: "no one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
The investments made in support of new projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoniland is dry has
The water flowing into rivers is oiled brown; it smells similar to that which exists in the petrol station: because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoniland in Nigeria.
Men are theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't épuisez," says the environmentalist to journalists for the calm: "you today still enough mud of oil before the lens of water."
The Nigerian 37 years tried to photograph a young sunk into the muddy water up to the chest, and drag the fat that surrounds it: this scene seems almost beautiful in the flash of water to the colour of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown nappes of crude oil.
On the shore of the River Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom said that once she was collecting shrimp by whole pails here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil has bounced a pipeline had exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen living in the small town near Bodo must now for six hours to reach the rich waters: the Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted areas in the world.
The full extent of the devastation is blindingly obvious leafing through the mangrove swamps crossings by rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat heartrending a brown water. anyone who plunges his hand the withdraws all covered in oil.
The roots of mangrove small emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. isolated palm trees are sadly hang their fins.
Looking in vain the clouds of birds, as it usually encounter in wetlands: as soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on the haven of old who resembles a gas station by the smell that it evokes.
"What happens here is war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sadness: "our life is characterized by a permanent danger with regard to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers have entered here; the first was organized resistance in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was executed later. in 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the Ogoni returning is prohibited in this society: while more than 2 million barrel of black gold daily are pumped through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines in the entire region of the Delta, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields are undeveloped Ogoni, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in water of steel sculptures as bizarre sculptures: it means very affectionately "Christmas trees" the head of drill holes.
They had up to 50 years, most are riddled by corrosion to the landmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in piece, as a constant flow of crude oil flows through the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres were dumped on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the equivalent to the amount of oil that leaked into the sea at the Exxon Valdez accident "super-pétrolier" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
That should be the responsibility of the continuing environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actor.
For the group Shell, sabotage and the siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. environmentalists for their part consider the explosions of rock-drilling warheads and perforated pipelines punctured as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group to apply in Nigeria to enforce safety standards mostly less strict than elsewhere in the world: only the rate of failures of pipes is "still much higher than alleures".
Some emerging forms of Mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles a workshop abandoned, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered in cambouis up to the neck.
A scintillating fire in one of the many tons that sometimes associated with pipes, sometimes scattered without ground on the site must be répérés: a small refinery underground.
It is heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, "says Michael, the team leader.
As a first step, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of kerosene drops fall and it finally obtained diesel.
This is as well that Michael and his four colleagues produced daily four barrels of Diesel 300 litres: "we reported 34 million Naira", about $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per litre of Diesel: free as they become the raw material.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of Unlocks pipeline across the country of the Ogoni. according to the experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant of the raw material is temporarily stored illegally purified: organized crime rings that are also among its members of politicians and senior military, load the lion's share in tankers and the bradent in the global market.
The activist Akpobari believes that the debate on the question of whether to award the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the public or the mode of production latitudinarian is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the lives of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there could be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But, Meanwhile, the relationship of the Ogoni especially to Shell have so much that it was no longer question that the withdrawal of the group. "perhaps that operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
So, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announcement the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can occur at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not under arrest, but at most they will offer bribes.
Even the soldiers especially from the north of the country will benefit as all Nigerians as the raw material.
"At any point of view, this fucken trick brought down our country well low", Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in the engines of the A380
The A380 is clearly a major security problem.
By examining a machine that has made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible default of construction that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor.
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers on the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had definitely been so far more likely: during its investigation, the Australian authority responsible for air safety found that the A380 some reactors had a serious safety problem, and she cautioned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks to the level of connecting the conduct of oil indique-t-on, in a statement published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure" reactors.
Those affected are manufactured Rolls-Royce reactors and equipping 20 aircraft of the A380.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to make an emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now started legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with the Australian Federal Court headquartered in Sydney. this approach gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would be damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Parts were separated and the bearing surface was damaged in the fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce is inflammation of oil which is responsible for the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 nuclear reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other security tests will be done on the superjumbos reactors which are also equipped with questions.
The recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman for the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The safety problem is deemed important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of the plane, the airline Qantas had touched down its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of his 11 A380.
The airline Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of the A380.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The snow throughout the country, causing chaos in transport
Germany any covered in white: overnight, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigned on all roads, trains and airplanes are locked in.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is grelotter Germany: by freezing temperatures, almost all of the republic is covered in snow in the night of Thursday, which led to chaos in many communities.
To the north and east, snow cover reached 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
National on the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service personnel worked permanently, but they could not overcome the snow kept accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept through the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal Office responsible for maritime navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves are held on the Baltic coast of SchleswigHolstein with water levels up to 1.2 metres above normal.
Piles of snow on motorways and federal on roads has caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the alert central weather Meteomedia announced the alert level purple has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that strong winds and costs have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck at night.
Even in the land of saxe-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disruption on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind led to an interruption to traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit hwys A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, fallen trees on the tracks, the needles strand or destroyed.
In Saxony, it had to interrupt the transport interrégional Leipzig-Nuremberg.
At Sallfeld, in Thuringia, a train bound for Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and beverages.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Snowfall led to numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced at Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said that 40 flights have already been cancelled at Frankfurt am Main.
The Winter Service provides a permanent Service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are more likely, despite this barely 400 beds are available.
The accident occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening to Ostholstein, a truck driver has died in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of these layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was struck at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train, that is why the road from Bayreuth in Nuremberg has been closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when his car was barrel on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce some good news: the snow will always soft and powdery, but tourbillonnera in case small bursts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by high winds and fast.
It is, however, very cold, up at least 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its Twin Towers.
The Deutsche Bank is seeking to separate from its emblem: according to information reported by newspapers, the financial institution is seeking buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The building could yield up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautify the headquarters of the group: the twin towers located in the Quartier cases have been modernized; meanwhile, bankers had to return to their former place of service.
Now, the financial group clearly sought to recover the cost of renovations and it is seeking a buyer for its two buildings, such as the wrote the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or sell them, and develop the new later."
Thus, the largest financial institution to Germany has already surrendered his seat, shortly after.
It is only in the middle of the year 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for a total of 272 million Euro to holders of equity. they were then rehabilitated.
The changes to the energy optimization have gobbled-up, according to some estimates, around 200 million euros.
A sale would, of course, a lot of money in the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in the industry believe the value of tours, renamed meanwhile "green" about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently unclear if the buildings will again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourning the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been a thought for minors buried who have been declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been able to trace the body because the security situation in the stricken wells continues to be fragile.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 Miners whose age is between 17 and 62 years had been buried under earth.
A probe had been introduced into the stricken wells, but it had not found any signs of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to drop in the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent post-detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be collected.
Today, family and friends held a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a brilliant sun to Greymouth south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, it has installed 29 tables on which you could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photographs and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also took their place.
Flags were flown at half-mast in all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the Memorial Day that New Zealand has fuelled hope that bolster the miners to the surface.
"But they are never returned to the house."
Mr Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in pits said that he cannot resign itself to accept the death of his son until he has not seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the Memorial Day.
Minors of British and South African origin were also buried in the first explosion of 19 November.
Searchers have begun to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine in the South Island of New Zealand.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to decline.
Goes to Hell, Warrior!
The film is an artificial Splatter?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the genre former through his film, "Walhalla Rising,", the warrior epic.
How public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn he might think turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye was taken prisoner; it is free of its executioner, and with a force almost supernatural, removes his opponents one after the other. it seems ideal for the young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero used brutal methods of murder. when it is in a bad mood, it takes the intestines of its enemies without waiting until they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed is no word on his true name. even the other characters leak, at most, in the course of one or two sentences some appalling cries of agony.
Otherwise, it says nothing and festoie in the mountainous landscape is incredibly beautiful of Scotland which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
That would be the ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in the existentialism and the travellings excellent.
When a film is more target-groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy on the fierce drug trafficker and full of style as a sort of Quentin Tarantinon danois, but he refuses to make a little more mood at mainstream or introduce a little less brutality in the cinema of art and testing.
Most supporters of art cinema supporters must face the horror in the brain that is spreading around and the intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed sailed, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a ship to destination of Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to fall silent.
It is not so surprising that "Walhalla Rising" found no distributor of films in Germany and that it only exists in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of beautiful images of poverty that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, hiding behind a grandiose appearance and bloody.
It is not a question of dialogue in the film, or a coherent, everything is atmosphere, a fever dream turned into film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn grant him barely a moment of rest and slowly cut her throat with a frigid images and audio dismal, but especially with a hatred unattachable flowing out of the heart of the figures.
Only a blond boy, held fidèlement alongside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all others are motivated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never known, but returned to hell at any time to fight enemies and allies temporarily turning into warrior, may be sent the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but perhaps, nothing for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, to finalité irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic Experience.
Excavation work Mysterious
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides new insights into a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this is a country refuses to take a position on this topic, still less to submit to inspections of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli I F-15 fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate, the largest city near lies 30 miles: this is Dair.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has reportedly built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of electrical current.
According to a briefing with US intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would make the atomic weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images blur.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the station, which is a miniature copy of the model nord-Coréen of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, even internally.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, it has barely more information that at the time, and even, with the time the mystery deepens increasingly.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor to el-Kibar peu', but had evidence that country was developing "an active nuclear weapons."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more careful about this and speak only of an alleged "reactor", even though they view the presentation of the CIA as "plausible".
They lack of evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about the way it ensures that it is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat of United Nations only gave a terse response in summer by stating that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly removed with haste the rubble of "unused military building" methodical and made a levelling off of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a Member State of commercial providers of satellite images showing the moment that followed directly the attaque. it seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired in exclusivity.
It is impossible for the IAEA to determine their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret atomic programme and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has rejected that argument after analysis of particles calling it was implausible.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion in that, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the destroyed building by the bomb.
But even Israel remains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "we will never comments on this issue.
It is as well that the investigation of this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without that there was a result and that it "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility of the Agency", as the recognizes a senior Western diplomat in service to the IAEA in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA believes that to make progress, we must clarify the existence of three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have not specified what it is facilities here, nor what is their function or have it may contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, "these are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan Iskandariayah, Iskandariayah, and also the name of neighbouring towns.
The Independent Institute Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most probably one suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is on a military base or directly beside it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access of three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it says that the Syrians fear that the group of inspection is in fact spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on its military installations.
Indeed, it is an information provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos indicating that vehicles have been shuttling between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to carry substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be used in the production of fuel ".
He would have "no indications on sensitive activities," such as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly operates through not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is the rigour of plausible assumptions concerning the basic questions: where should have come and where uranium or plutonium separated later needed for the production of the bomb.
It is unclear if the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored at the three sites.
When the hundreds of truckloads of land will have disappeared, nobody will have information on repository of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has made review in 1998 the salt-mine of al-Tibni, located only a few miles from el-Kibar, the other side of the Euphrates, to see if we can agree the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recent satellite photos on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs show, however, that Syria began bulldozing in the three sites suspects and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but that has not helped to allay suspicions.
As it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to do. this plan to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. only time invested shows how great interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, though Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency was not reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador in recent months is what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful tools including the International Atomic Energy Agency has to implement its controls.
The head of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to the future", but it is still reluctant.
This method has an enormous risk: on one hand, it requires a majority at the IAEA Board of Governors and a good number of 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation about an escalation.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives réflechir: "this would be, if in the end they do not find anything"
Love War-Time
They're not since Angelina Jolie made its debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
There is nothing more about this story, but it is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumour suggests that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love with his executioner of Serbia during the war in Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. in response, some planned film sequences in Sarajevo were displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continued still in Bosnia.
According to information published in a newspaper Bakira Hasecic Bosniacs, the organization of women victims of war has sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress herself. pretty UNHCR goodwill ambassador.
It is not a diplomat. a few weeks ago already, it has proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"The meeting to be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie says quite a lot about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the quality of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie she wrote?
The Department of the Bosnian culture, which has received copies of his scenario, after some hesitation, granted permission to filming in Sarajevo, but it is not known why is not then come despite the authorization.
The young author provides itself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is making a great deal of effort it was made aware of the Yugoslav conflict. she claims that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and provide an opportunity for all the parties involved to speak.
However, it is vague about the content.
Thus, a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet. it is quite different: lovers knew well before the start of the war. it will meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the concentration camp Serbe where the man worked as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape if amourache of his executioner".
That the film of Jolie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, so says Jolie, is "unfair and based on erroneous information."
Now, only the Hollywood fanatics can provide peace: illegally by this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Take us
Tonight, all is well among the Irish.
No trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans howl of joy amid a strong music, they trample feet.
Cork Baileyu-Pub in southern irlande vibrates because the players launch and succeed in bringing down the table tennis at a distance of three metres in beer cups from the opposing team.
The bizarre spectacle is called "bière-pong". the winner gets more 500 euros a ticket to go see in January in Las Vegas at the world championships of bière-pong.
Cian Tanner is an individual calm; the subtle game and the technician reserved, these two practices do not really go well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years trying to have fun, to deflect the issue boring, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in its projects. in January, he will conduct interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling," he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I didn't work."
Finally: his girlfriend awaits him already in Auckland, "in less than two, she earned her job wished project as responsible event, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of the bleak outlook for the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
Its sister, Yvonne, a social worker and resident in Sydney, his brother Colin now working as a computer consultant in London.
The young go: the situation of the majority of families living on the island are similar to that of tan.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish soon leave their country.
They provide for even a number of provinces-Newfoundland 200,000 by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million.
If these predictions are correct, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoys great ﬂuency, grief is now taking the whole place.
However, the economic crisis affects however especially the young people, well-trained, who have known so far that moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and the Social Lapsing seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under age 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published extensively letters written by young readers provinces-Newfoundland, who complain: "in Ireland, everything is adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but one that has the potential, if going and our country and a whole generation."
"The last to leave off the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the student union Irish, sees a darker future because the government only window dressing and offers no future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the young étudiante 20 years.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to an unpaid practicums to another.
She said that are his biggest concerns is to emigrate itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However, the men like Stephen McLarnon positively trying to address this issue.
McLarnon organizes the show "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers a full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But the work abroad is for those new to the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the ranks professional," says the head.
Her website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and surfers in CAnAdA.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a hardship, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland that engineer for 29 years, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just fate of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visited his native country, because it is involved in a position of extra work, to be able to complete to repay the credit contracted to build his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit daft," he says in crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I won money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live now."
He broke out of an embarrassed laugh through the cool conditions.
The small house is in a residential area with front gardens cared for, expensive brands of cars are stationed on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount 380,000 euros, funded to 100 percent by the credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
A-t-il fear that any collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects a time, are hot tea and said: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; same everything goes wrong, I can start from zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the laments that it is often these days.
"Nobody should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as bad as what was once lived here on the island," he wrote.
"Work for a time abroad, this is not what can happen worse, perhaps it is the fact that we feel first Irish.
He laughs and then spoke to his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
The idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his charts, It already has a few years working in London. that is why life cannot be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still something that the worried well these last few days: festival held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into evening of farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says over a long sip beer.
"A farewell, it is still worrying."
"Call it rather an evening of goodbye, a relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as to private enterprise.
The crime has become a greater concern as unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey was done regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two elements stand out the results of the survey this year, conducted in September and early October.
The first is quite sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased to a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after suffering a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the average régionale (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents across the region are satisfied with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same number as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in sharp rise compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If it held good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries of America experienced only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a network of social security network helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, at 32 percent.)
But the mood varies greatly from one country to another (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes escalated.
This is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than the unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable to the development, against 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% felt that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% supported the private company); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of respondents (against 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, down 11 per cent since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential countries by respondents in Mexico and throughout much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A a smeared
Nobody was expecting to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the "outsiders" who wanted to help the stricken country and plunged in fear.
It was presented with ballot boxes, and a new voting, ballot papers scattered in the goutières, PSs ransacked and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, walked in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen presidential contenders, including several alleged favourites, have denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "an election fairly good in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they "do not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily had invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, Past-President impopulaire, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be annulled.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million in earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In the case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular government legitimate and as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians are doing it themselves.
Point feet toward the Centre
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy from the public that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, to more than 50 per cent; it is his highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet turn this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, visibly in mourning, that it would leave or not the intransigence of her late husband and predecessor, former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the signs are still confused.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has allowed the first couple to spend the extra money at will.
Ms Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissenting members of the movement péroniste have rallied to Mrs. Fernández.
But after meetings (where a chaotic parliamentary struck in the face with one of its peers and where others have accused the government of corruption), Congress does not to approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to play," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9 per cent this year.
The official rate of inflation is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage demands of unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
He has refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, who proceeded to the falsification of the official inflation.
Ms Fernández could now moderating these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And officials say they want to limit the wage increases next year to 6 per cent.
The economy has been driven by high world prices for Argentina's farm exports.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms Fernández has shown signs of wanting to re-establish financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has reached an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring forced the debt on which Argentina had not paid its milestones in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with garanti governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; what looks like a prelude to clean the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms Fernández is to remain in politics beyond the end of his term, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have returned.
If it wants to win another election, it will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
Taiwanese voters are are geared towards a kind of a closer union with the continent.
What that Taiwan think its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters were presented on 27 November, 70% of those eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in what is seen as a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has himself become a substitute for the feelings from the continent, with innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact with the biggest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five mairies, he has failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the démocrate-progressiste Party (DPP), which has looked to complete independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes cast for the KMT 45%.
If this had been a presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the part of his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT municipal councils.
The event has unveiled most of the main topics of Taiwanese elections, including trucks and flags to aggressive campaign of mass rally with girls who dansaient minimum required.
A mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Link, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted a campaign tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Link, purely through the face, the injuring and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it has not been determined if the shooter wanted to do harm to Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, murder has had an impact on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how the issue of mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have jouté with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan generally enjoys its de facto independence and dislikes the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid displaying its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also failed to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, has claimed a confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
It is expected that the government in Beijing continues to provide commercial facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan, of homecoming.
China lost no time to send a negotiator in Taipei to organize a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see a political integration; but let's start at the beginning.
Better to wait until after the presidential election in 2012.
The DPP has reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it went wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a troublemaker in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates saw the day under the direction of Ms. Tsai and PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a candidate of the DPP to the Presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it, too, can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party has an "alternative trustworthy" from the hasty approach Mr. Ma on China.
Mr. Chen is exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates of the PDP would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He has even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP will struggle to choose between its potential candidates.
The need for the KMT introspective of himself.
Assessments of Mr. Ma have been low; despite a dizzying economic growth, the candidates KMT have not wanted to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his Cabinet and its local branches will be reviewed.
The good results of the PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see the economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Nominations for Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Performing at the request of a president, and people are required to read.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist and singer 26 years picked by hand by President Obama to occur during the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a major appointment in the category of "best new artist."
Whereas Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains somewhat mysterious, but it is consistent with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not leave over three albums before the registration; what "establishes the public identity of the artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward and, given its vocal style slightly urging, his hand clever of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line to Spalding from the brilliant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to voters of the Grammy Awards, taking into account the jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" Vijay Iyer Trio in the category, "an instrumental album" focusing on a shudder reinvigorating a recording which was a favourite primordia last year.
These Iyer, "Moody 4B" veteran of saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" keyboardist John Beasley will be particularly in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite in the hoarseness of New Orleans and invited frequent "Treme" HBO, has been honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also tilts strongly towards a merger with certain albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Savage's secret Society Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved reconnaissances in the category large together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose album "Pathways" his octet' 's live was a fine example of the Democratic hand this bassist as group leader.
Appointment of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the conventional
The conventional appointments for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards include a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
In head of appointments include "Deus Ex Machina" of Michael Daugherty, to the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" Steve Mackey, a electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and who opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also nominated for an award.
Conventional appointments are held in 13 categories covering recordings of orchestre, opera, solo and choral.
A category for the classic producer of the year highlights five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies No 3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of" famous featuring various artists; and the Verdi "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

The draft of the mosque in Temecula won the approval of the planning commission.
A proposed mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that he was promoting both of terrorism that traffic congestion.
But the commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new centre religieux complied with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people even came to support it: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, as you mention," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a US citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just vote very strong."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people voting for or against the centre, the time almost equally divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the Web site of the journal.
"There is more to America", wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of the order of 135 co-existe families without incident in the Riverside County for years but wanted more space and better than the warehouse that she has rented on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque in 24,943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be composed of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would be a 4,32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles east of Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against the project on the City Council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers found the bacterium unusual here on Earth, they say it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, either with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life form" étrangère "," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria discovered in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to grow after replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"We wondered what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss this, which has not disclosed the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other global environments, the agencies could be able to use other elements to actuate the biochemistry and that the whole" standard "elements, that we are absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Scientific Research planétaire and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and the biochemical structure," added Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of NASA Astrologie, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has been speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute one to the other.
Arsenic is poisonous "mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the agencies have difficulty distinguishing these components separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different to that it doesn't work exactly as phosphorus; it cuts inside and, in a way, the work of our gum biochemical machine," said Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and have exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic in which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic in the place raises the possibility that some form of life using arsenic can occur naturally or else on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic may be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that this could walk.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the earth, she says; therefore, the researchers hypothesized that the first life forms could use.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just how life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs were found stolen exposure to Compton
The other two dogs exhibit on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County sheriffs have announced Thursday.
The four dogs of exposure - two akitas and two pembroke Welsh corgis - have disappeared Tuesday, when someone stole the truck Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a Sheriff's Department spokesman in Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that the dogs go well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where dogs were found in the area and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We do not want to say," Whitmore a-t-il said.
"We are following orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment Thursday.
They were met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a County animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a male of 3 years, and Didi, a female in 10 months - were unharmed, the authorities have announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, on behalf of owners of Japanese dogs were missing until their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National championat "AKC / Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they were present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions other tests prescribed in the days before the exhibition "AKC / Eukanuba," said Peek in the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the rulings of the canine exhibition tour canine almost a month of the couple.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard had checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and their pickup truck parked outside, next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy Boxer, a burrow Parson Russell and a épagneul breton - who stayed with them in the chamber of the motel.
But they have left the Akitas and the corgis, thicker fur in the truck where it would be more costs.
They have just opened the windows so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the truck to 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to again blush, the restructuring of MGM is no longer expected that the final go-ahead to the Court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, has officially praised Thursday the plan "pre-packaged" by the creditors that approximately $5 billion of debt would be erased; paving the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision on Thursday that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, no legal obstacle does remain before MGM to recover afloat under the tutelage of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who become the Directors-General of what will be a studio eased.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 on 400 at the outset.
MGM will not emerge really Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not have concluded a credit facility of $500 million, expected to fund the new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which itself faces to 75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the direction on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay the interest amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in reorganization known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts to Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio have taken much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, at the end of 2009, putting the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders including none of them was willing to pay $2 billion more in which creditors were looking.
In the spring of this year, it was all re-conduct while the team of MGM had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, has finally been approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fate of bankruptcy in the following weeks, companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
The companies of Cooper, who had collected $375,000 per month for their services management of the company, will receive a "success" bonus of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account boost production of MGM, which has released only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would graduate from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan from $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be carried out by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 per cent of MGM's debt, has tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies had not reached an agreement.
Jouets Tech to maintain your budget in budget equilibrated
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps by the video game system from Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes to $99 and that a game Kinect costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes of beads, or approximately 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more force; while costing the same price or even a bit less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally less new toys associated with Web sites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys to button batteries are increasing, as well as toys for rechargeable batteries.
Here are some Recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys to the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press on the belly.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second is to compose a song.
If you buy more, they sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you cannot stop.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Based on the technology of Elmo Live last year, the doll animatronique 14 inches plays games turns as Simon Says and can make dance lunaire thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel-lock.
Children who have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall of Alphie, one of the first IT-driven educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older) with a backpack full of game cards questionnaire designed to transform a ride in a car in a session with a auto-correction and a binder of valves.
If you're wary when your child is your smartphone, here are three alternatives self-reliant.
The Mobigo of VTech ($60 for the 3 to 8 years) is the cheaper and easier to use, with a QWERTY keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for the 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a screen more recent and more luminous.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for the 3 to 7 years) uses a system like iTunes to offer games and electronic books and has an entry for SD card, which will display photos of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing online blocks before the time lag is ideal for an impromptu Spelling Bee.
Increasingly, the toys have a sort of online connection.
By not based on their presence in toy shops, the two largest Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet in line of Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for the 6 to 12 years), which includes a room marked a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits to Club Penguin for two articles in the choice.
It may be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10 for 5 years and over is the last micro-robots to button.
The false moves quickly Park on 12 silicone wood-pulps vivid in random directions.
It is amusing to a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop of the kitchen table and even a temporary pass in the Gueule our dog.
Make a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait a place of the city as a place of an urban sergent training inspecting severely its nerve loads, low voice of orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - responsible for large public order in China, feared and despised for their repression arbitrary and their penchant for violence - provide a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"" Stick right! "
"" "Piercing Soyez!"
Show them, he says, "in which resemble the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and trousers in olive drab, figeaient at attention.
Four pairs of black to heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated well perched at the top of hair tied in a knot rayé in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of city inspectors to China.
A city has required that all new recruits have a higher diploma.
Guangdong province has swapped the grey-green blue uniforms against a supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan in central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by the hard way: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded a trolley to snack uncontrollable by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed up his belongings and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation of image.
Since 2003, the District has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their curve and their young age.
The idea is to give the police roughed a softer side, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to attract the look on this Brigade urbaine Souterraine China
And for good reason, critics say.
Unlike the police, these agents are allowed to enforce the municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese news media portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Hubei province was beaten to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film in the train to disperse a protest against a landfill waste.
Last year, a training manual for the inspectors to Beijing, stolen and posted online, outlines how defeat effectively offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a peddler of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for downloading online, shows Chinese inspectors trained over street-traders.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy on the tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "veritable thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial published in The Beijing Evening News, was asked if the women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the District required female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years, to have a good silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They should be larger than the average, or 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at age 26 years.
The officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"This is the image that is important," said a district officer in Rednet.com, a web site.
"First, the qualities of external candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of the Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "in addition to be vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management of the district of the city, do not agree with that description.
But he noted that the height requirements standard were the norm in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
Such is the case of the exigeance on the order of facial features.
That means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or disfigured should not apply.
"We cannot allow a person or a serving humpback chub come here," said Mr. Zheng.
"It would not be a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and has the cheeks with a mouth pommelées comminuted curved-in.
It does not consider the development of its appearance as sexist, "she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his colleague in the pits aged 21, said: "our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not object to what their mandate is limited, they said, because they have larger career ambitions than merely hunt sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen vendors who move quickly on foot or bicycle, trying to sell the most possible rolls or bowls of tofu before escaping.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already said several times!", said Ms. Xu while a seller had fled on foot, leaving her to temporarily to noodles.
The officials describe their functions rather monotonous that difficult.
"This is roughly the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"" Great routine. "
One reason is that the female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property sellers.
They can only threaten to report violators to their male superiors.
This tends to protect the sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread false rumours that agents of the chengguan had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the chengguan were wounded, 14 government vehicles were toppled or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang place, where the female officers patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
Officers have confiscated a motorbike which was being repaired on the sidewalk, rather than in a store, as the regulations.
The owner of the motorbike shouted to the scandal.
A tug-of-war 15 minutes followed before the police, face disaster, have blazed a path with elbow blows to their vehicle and parties are at full speed with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, remained behind, white badge returned to hide his name.
As the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained for oil to maintain an image.
"Sometimes, we are fighting verbally."
"Sometimes, we are fighting physically," said Li said a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public who begins."
Prosecutors do not inculperont senator Ensign
Justice prosecutors have lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, arising from a case linked to an assistant of a former campaign and its efforts to obtain a lobbying work for the husband of the woman, have announced Wednesday, lawyers for the Senator.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, Republican of Nevada who was seen as a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case is the national headlines last year and hurt his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign said he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of an investigation of a year.
Senator could still be at risk of disciplinary action taken by the Senate ethics committee.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign did more investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, that there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a ban on lobbying federal criminal.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first disclosed in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to earn the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton had once served as treasurer in a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the case, seems at odds with the prohibition of the so-called revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a plot to rape and material breach of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the department had declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks high-level cashed in his section of the public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of défense who has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, lead counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and up the next day, saying that the department was not trying to charges against his client.
The team of lawyers from Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the Senator, as his office reiterated Wednesday in a news release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments it had made to prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we believe they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission has decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint by the independent ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96.000 by parents of Mr. Ensign to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said that it did not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company of Nevada who has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told her that he "martelait" the Department of the Interior on an issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and it has asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the leader in Republican ranks fourth in the Senate.
Having kept a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was not the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator had hoped that the ethics committee quickly would follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
The appeal of Cheshire will flow to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the process of typing away in rows of the courtroom.
They sent all the minutes of reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defence has said that there are more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a house which was set on fire.
Thursday, the trial widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who has been convicted of killing three members of the family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is expected to lead to a formal end where the judge would impose the death penalty, passed by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes had already submit any charting arguments to the court of appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative, it is that the intense coverage of the trial - as well as widespread use and extended by journalists of the Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was improperly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could push the appeal judges to discuss the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"I have experience during the trial; I think there's a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms violates the rights of the individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of State answers, has rejected the claims in the judgement last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board would have been led by the passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appellate courts have recognized for decades that the media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a judgment of landmark 1966, the United States Supreme Court has overturned the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal for review seized half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be needed to manage the means of communication courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it has been applied arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue says some appeal judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instantaneous communication from courtrooms could allow more just trial.
The case of Twitter is one among many others described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; which is delaying the execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when the judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reaction of potential jurors by showing them lurid photos of crime scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years.
Defence lawyers argue that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and they will argue that the judge was unfairly evicted the juror, who had been critical to prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual step of getting the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The stampede of media daily tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," wrote lawyers, "does resembled nothing had been seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even to the national level."
Their emphasis on the cover of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that the instant new releases were more incendiary that recovered more slowly, was a view luddiste that would impoverish the policy of the Court for media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal étaitent often attracted to the arguments that the social and technological change required an adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 who had reversed the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of the media coverage of the trial and they indicated that they would use the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," écrivaient-ils ", represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st Century."
Civility can bridge the divides?
After a campaign marked by the invective and the negativity, a modicum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation to the front or a time illusory before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the key issues that need to be addressed during the session of the "lame duck".
But clearly, there are at least had a polite discussion on differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score empty marks. scoring point supporter.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the commission on the deficit of the president has been equally civilized, despite political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but, however, still divides members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and mutual tested for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments were unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or the rights, the two parties remain of miles away.
Yet, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now at the side of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"It is inevitable after the election.
The elections are partisan passions, and then they estomptent.
This is good. "
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to keep some or all, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not least because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing the unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimism flat on a possible agreement on issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the pact "New START".
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "duck" blade ménera does not necessarily a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be made will be the psychology in the short term will revert to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner has also expressed scepticism that the widely shared civilité would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing over the main event in 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present tea which contributed to its creation.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they should try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee of the deficit which include reform the tax code and to increase some taxes, raise the retirement age and cut expenses.
The co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have imposed on themselves, imposed the issue of the shortfall on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the committee, composed of 18 members, to submit their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have struggled to reach this number.
The greater resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group, suggesting that there is on tax matters, at least today, little reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of clashes supporters, given that Republicans oppose Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of Change?
Public public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, when the two parties will watch carefully the public's reaction.
That will be tried in loss should change course and seek compromise.
But it will be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are larger now than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a more ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on issues that divide them.
The American documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of Corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and pushed up in the Kremlin part bribes and money of protection that it collects, reported the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service rackets are making huge that help to explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They are raising money not only of legitimate companies but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share, while the money went to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was mailed Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The Note is based on sources whose names have been removed.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been little trace of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction business leader, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several libel trial on those charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "it is crazy, it is to lay, it is anything."
The Russians believe, an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of embassy; and it is incredible to think that this would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the government of the City of Moscow and crime has led some people in the name of "dysfunctional" and to say that the government functioned more as a kleptocracy that a government ", according to the notes of the Embassy.
The criminal elements enjoy "krysha" (a term used in the criminal world / the mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Department of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the FSB breaststroke money from the larger companies and that the police are targeting small.
A source, he said, "explained that the Moscow business owners understand that it was better to obtain protection from the FSB and MVD (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more money and more power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"That is why the request for protection by criminal gangs is not so high."
The note said that, although the collection money should be extended, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those who do not pay their quickly close under any pretext or another.
Medvedev referred to several times the fight against corruption, but he admitted the little progress.
The notes of the embassy transmits reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, Director of the Indem think tank "of Moscow.
"But it is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, no separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would be on the scale of Russia as a whole, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country has been ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least in more corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, which was was carried out yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, in part, to the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin has speculated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger to the point that U.S. diplomats had disclosed in the appellant Batman and Robin closer Medvedev.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, important factor in domestic politics in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly lit with concrete walls decrepit of poor quality, the director of the school in Anlong Veng referred to the man who had built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here like Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Sreng, aged 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was the head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where it has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the longtime loyalty is finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to respond publicly to people who had participated in the plan.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, made its first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Before this, anxiety has increased with veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng, complicating the reconciliation efforts and their wishes to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation is divisions within the family."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movements of visit in December 1998.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary headed the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating with the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk in abject poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although a few elite officers Khmer Rouge have kept their posts of local leader in exchange for having laid down their arms, it is farmers not qualified in low rank and file.
"These people have benefited from very shortly after the capitulation," said Leang Sok-to of the Centre for justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in agrarian utopist ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in an environment where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as'adolescent in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has also provoked concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the trial of Nuon Chea Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The Court's mandate is to try senior leaders and most responsible for crimes, but he has not said if it continues beyond these four cases.
It should be more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchhey under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she said researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers were killed.
Recently, in a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court the convened, she said, she refused to go there.
"Cambodia is peace and stable", "she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has defected to the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would happen if the court had several suspects; although the experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But confronting the past is all that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the resource centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer language is to reconnect the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put the pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details of the Khmer Rouge, despite links to the city on a diet.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at the high school in Anlong Veng, said that the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court continue."
Such resistance has rendered the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok-to Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of Dangrek mountains, a road, invaded by weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, age 31, of mobile phone vendor roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea, and later that day, she had planned to walk towards the final resting place of Pol Pot, where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing the chance.
Belarus agreed to relinquish its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for the nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials in the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, during a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to renounce the highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But American officials have told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus in the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This has opened the door to an agreement Wednesday to remove the rest of the field of about £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations, held at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit in 2012."
"It shows me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant step, significant" conducted by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Nuclear Security Summit of Obama, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never turn away from its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially of weapons-grade uranium and the low enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"This is our product... We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We'll use it for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus is closer to the United States a few months ago, however, in showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October, has been particularly complicated because the material had been slightly unirradiated, officials have said.
It was loaded on a special train has travelled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials have said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was conducted by air, according to the officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace research facilities of Belarus with LEU; unsuitable for the weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented in order to build confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy specialized in the Minimization of the World Endangerment.
According to estimates by the Centre d'Étude of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh crackdown by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and Human Rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential for the country's progress and its citizens," she said.
The government has no objection to the CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo through of the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States in Madrid.
This is shown by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in daily El País, adding that the first vice-president of the Government of the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Executive is informed Spanish for "pouvoir' demonstrate that they had adequate vigilance on the foreign aircraft across Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report that accused of complicity in contrary to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The vice-president has acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega said that Spain has no objection regarding the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise," said Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Ministry of External this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Exécutif "wanted to bring this matter to the profile low as possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez sent to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents of the National Centre of Intelligence (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating evidence, any sensitive information," said the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has shown when even their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors allemands' over the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between the Governments," said Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of an inflammatory rhetoric, trying to rebaisser the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the PP's action in the case.
"In spite of its general direction, pro-American, our experience suggests the fact that PP certainly will benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those révélations-là have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she adds.

"It will remain with the correct person, i.e. with me, and I will ever do in my life with another person if the person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their poor relations.
In July, there is another post.

The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the event had occurred, "and she did not have the intention to harm the child".

Members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the 9 SUBP loses
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of the Tarragona, and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and Members recorded in the latest autonomous elections, the PP Catalan has already referred the general, because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive that, because the number of votes that this training gets in these comices double normally that it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the populaires won 610.473 votes in the 2008 general, while the 2006 autonomous, they had obtained 316.222.
On Sunday, the CPP has obtained 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend desired, a diversion of votes of the CHP and retention of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that if there would be a general election, the SLC could past 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU also win in four (it now has 10) and S.U.B. loses no more and no less than 9 Members (it has 25).
These calculations would see that the place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of populaires, CRFs would lose an MP - he has three now - while LCIs would retain a Member or earning.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the more next meeting would be held in May of 2011 for the comices municipales, where the populaires may also be decisive at the end of the Socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relays at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, a jurisdictions that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists as the populaires agree with the fact that CCS could lose the mairies of Barcelona, Tarragona, and Girona, where the socialists would gain the majority not the possibility of using their traditional partners, RCTs and LCIs.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this training will lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, and the Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital city of Tarragona, where they have governed with the PP before the current socialist Mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
To the, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to SUBP, including the mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they found several times.
The populaires have also reported progress in other municipes important as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of locations.
The Catalan cell has helped thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
The seven inmates in Barcelona in Thailand there were three
The seven and the nigérien held by agents of the Information Commissioner General of the Barcelona police formed a jihadist cell, which led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, between which "The for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the author of the Mumbai terrorist attacks that have caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "been debilitated" the aircraft falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years that it was active in Catalonia, have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged, and then distributed to groups that incorporated the galaxy criminelle Al Qaeda for its "combatants" can take the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell dismantled is the only that the jihadist network operative held in Europe, it is for this that participated in the investigation, part of Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days beaten similar to that recorded the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (it has detained Pakistanis Junaid Humanayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the nigérien Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand was conducted another, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was those who headed for Bangkok simon-pure cell in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - flew mostly tourists passports who met the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front".
It is, say the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas estampées.
The investigators point out that so far there was no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, even if the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receptors for passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless the fact should be recalled that a few days before that this attack is committed, Catalonia has been sent through an agency transfers $a few miles of dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that have been used by the ingrained after the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The Police seized a vast literature.
PP requests Mas to suspend the tax complicity
The leader of CPPs, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas its conditions to support his nomination as chairman of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and that is down to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of aventures philo-souverainistes as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address to half of its mandate.
The president of Catalan populaires arrived the appointment with Artur Mas with safety which gives having scored 18 MEPs on Sunday in elections past, more than enough to be love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training that the opposition will abstain in the vote of the inauguration.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support a "nomination should eliminate all the speeches sovereignists and indépendantistes", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converge wants to submit even in the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to lose weight the political apparatus of autonomic administration very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas will on the part of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (SUBP) - who has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (LCIs) and today it will with Joan Puigcercós (CRFs), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatric the claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly
The geriatric responsible for The Caritat of Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage done to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who has killed at least 11 elderly which he was responsible in the meantime he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, came accompanied by counsel for the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be the one to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility we must take the procedural situation officials civilians".
And part of the social discrediting the entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date of August 2009 and from that day he has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the award that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - care it suspected that in many cases no doctor do personally explored the deceased but, given the age and the pathologies of patients, the formality was held by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday that situation and said that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of The Caritat added that "in this case there is only an index of carelessness on the part of any other person that is the accused".
The person already named as the "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday admitted 11 murders and detailed that it made the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he killed him by injecting a sobre-dose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The Director of The Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access to medicine center staff.
The insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But lab tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that it had sought for its first victims a less cruel death or by contrary it has burned inside the donnant laundry as he has already confessed that he has done with the three women that he shot in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders procurador, they do not remove the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threat
Investors have reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday that Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
Peripheral spreads have closed the force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5 per cent.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of ECB to deceive and the euro has barely registered a increments, which is a signal in order.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way as it collapses, it will recover, but motivated by fences and very speculative short positions.
The institutional investor fails to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB gave us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and those who remain.
Bundesbank required the finalisation of the plan to buy public debt because of its ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity to term and leaving only unrestricted access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that it extends the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintains the quarterly auction trimestrielle unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the programme to purchase obligations and you give even the signal of the increase.
If they do not perform the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent market reaction yesterday and they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
And during their meeting in May in which they said they had not even considered buying bonds and they have collapsé markets, history might repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday, he said he had already purchased a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the auction -ABA auction a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million 4,81 per cent in the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland we published the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures estimated 10,000 million estimated short-term potential and 15,000 and they have a delay until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance, and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a household of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate the tone of his speech to ease tension before the next summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to submit the measures plan yesterday that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Reforme pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, steps to revive employment ring to the gills of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP said the fact that the Spanish stock market has suffered the 4.5%, double the rest of European stock markets.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the effect surprise.
Today there is a enchère-clé of an obligation to three years will be bénéficiée by Trichet, therefore we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinance.
On Spain ask for a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more 40.000 million in available liquidity, the triple compared to March, to types very expensive and they cut access to markets indefinitely.
However, the strategy must continue to be the wife's Caesar, "to be part of the sound".
Courage, we can get out!
The President of Eulen challenged the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm did not end in the open conflict in the family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, challenged, as it considers "no of law", the Judicial Council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they try to assert their majority and grab management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his son Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute over control of part of the group.
The founder of holding more business services for companies does not appear to be willing to relinquish in their dispute to be present in the bodies of direction of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the meeting of shareholders of 18 January this year, including the challenge is registered in the Register of Trade and Sociétés.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrat Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has opened new Thunders within the family Álvarez.
The appeal to the court to set the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the assembly.
The final movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate applicants use of his five sons to try, through a procedural quibbling, defrauding clearly the Act and abusing the law, validate and correct the zero radically meeting on 18 January", according to its official mouthpieces.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting takes place, is being challenged by considering that it is "null and void".
The same players, keeping a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the judge convenes a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group seeks nevertheless services usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the protocols familiar.
This case is the fundamental question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of protest for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars, in real time.
As soon as Red Bull es entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of the speed has been marked by surprise and by the success.
As a first time, nobody has taken into account the options of a new stable just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they have all bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the ability as a pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 it spoke of the legend of "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful simulation software to process that the German company was launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of the automobilistique top-class.
Appointed PLM, this powerful tool technology has been used to create networks of people who produce assembly plants across the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The goal is reproduce, accurately simulate the product or the process before the build of a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or most famous vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, said the fact that the use of this device technology in its plant in Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull to create and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during shopping and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team now work 180 young professionals of high qualifications which, equipped with powerful computer equipment and analyze planning any kind of changes on the cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
It amends the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes may move from the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by autoclaves laser and high technology.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the $40 million that each team can spend as Formula 1 limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has implanted the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that is happening is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty in 580 people, enclosed two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian.
Between the huge technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other actors hidden, whose work is invaluable and zero visibility.
The director of technology for the plant, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago you could argue that the progress of R + D in the case of racing cars brought the 50 per cent of victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents the 85% of success, while the pilots apportent the 15% of the value added.
Nevey says the Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install own 20 stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first store in Barcelona exclusive collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will tally this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the revamped store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which it is 30 years that it works.
The North American group has prepared a plan to build 200 brand outlets in Europe by 2013, a strategy that includes the Spanish 20 schools.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade, Serbia, last week, the Barcelona being the third.
Herrero was unwilling to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the implantation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the industry.
The group advises and is responsible for the design of the exclusive furniture stores (with products that may be affected in an interactive manner), which will be a similar image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers staff training settlements.
Helena Herrero has denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of commerces claims to "improve the service offered to clients and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, the post-vente and even the packaging".
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a pilot programme to pioneer at global possible that solves the problems of computer equipment HP as collateral.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"The system is designed specifically for the MPEs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet on 'steal' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the chief executive of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, think that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of interest margins, that it will try to offset partially by increments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell look tune-into in three years a million customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for three years and the future to survive as well in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will march in 2011 a new master plan that will hold an ability is three years.
The goal, in part to survive without need for public subsidies FROB, is to win a rating of market by the uptake of a million new customers - 700,000 if one deducted those who can break the banque-, its great task, because so far the bank had tainted the more SMEs and societies that the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250.000 50,000 customers and companies.
Its rating of the individual market is 3.5 per cent, while the companies it beyond the 10%.
Another base 2011-2013 plan 2011-2013 is a gamble on productivity, or which is the same thing, austerity, with reducing costs as objective, provocations which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disturbed all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise this year its blueprint Optima, establishes it ya four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an exercise more.
Customers who leak boxes of savings will be his main objective.
During a breakfast hosted by FIPA, Guardiola has insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult year transcendental and".
The executive, in fact, believe that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential to the survival of the bank case, has insisté-t-il.
And even if he thinks the war of liabilities - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that the banks and pay for its emissions to get liquidity already move the price of credit to offset the drop in margins.
"The aspect of the liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not tightened the tap, but are more senior differentials," acknowledged Guardiola.
BANESTO has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 Nov.-.
He also confessed that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The master plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "will seek" larger dimensions. "
"Everything will happen next year," assuré-t-il.
He claims that the needs of capital "increase dramatically" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it says that the FROB can replace the market in the uptake of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the close chemically-resolved markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some are already predicting bank as a new liquidity crisis.
He noted that one cannot issue, but rather what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisse
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a new wave of mergers of boxes of savings and insisted again on the speed with which is restructuring the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there have been several entities that have ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d Épargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I believe that the vast majority of mergers was conducted, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most was done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have been made already under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, who worked a lot in this operation also," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of Executive Officers and of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is "the greatest speed possible and we have to be very satisfied with the way that it is in the time that it was set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé-t-il.
"The passage of 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 per cent to be much greater for conform to Bâle," souligné-t-il.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of views somewhat happy on the slow pace of the process" who showed "a lack of sérosité and meaning, because" what the Bank of Spain is recall that we must respect the time before the end of the year ".
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and "probably" of the world and he attributed to people who questioned a "lack of knowledge".
The leader said that given the current economic conditions, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and crates of savings, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the faster speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has taken stress tests that ECB has made in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but he sets the terms for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have led to a doble Government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or removal of 426 euros in aid to the unemployed without professional contributions to the privatization of 49% of Valencia, management of Barajas airport and El Prat and 30% of Loteries of the state.
For another, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe González, is uniting to criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel in regard to its responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
It should be noted that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its communication-based policy.
On the contrary, it is another limitation of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there, Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, which angered with that to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of resistance européennes, Germany are beginning to speculate on the possible three out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable opinion, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines on countries that transgress, the possible suspension of payments by one of them and extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and so long as it is defined, so now there is no place for an apology.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany would think we should do (plans of fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci-inclut France, practiced.
The second blow of the Central European countries was when Merkel has not extended the decision to rescue Greece.
At that moment, it was the subject of a ferocious criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, to the end of October, Merkel reiterates a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time the private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should attend the process of reforme of the Union which is possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it did not believe cross-tabulate.
And she tells us all that, although now we must take measures with which it may not be too agree, from that date the former operation of the euro would have finished.
2013 Will mean the birth of a new currency zone, in which the countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default and, in this case, the private sector to bear as a party of costs.
Germany we said that we must follow a severe growth path with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances positive.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with the huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just extend the public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what it absolutely must not do in these circumstances is we deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence leave happen to us a tranquilité greater.
And that we can seize the opportunity that we were given, until spring 2013.
It appears that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his dual statement (the promised reforms after the meeting of the past Saturday with large businesses and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite criticism by Merkel, it opened the way to the thesis that we need to bring order to the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is, and they don't seem to move.
And among the possibilities being considered, you cannot exclude that to abandon a currency zone, packed with little countries too frivolous.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that it had warned.
Sport and law
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity, but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion ourdie in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has spilled a lot of ink on the anti-sportif nature of such behaviour and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before closing the match (that their team was already clear), the two players have deliberately lost the time when they committed misconduct to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
As well, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players serve the regulatory sanction during the game's next match against Auxerre dam and can pass without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the Disciplinary Committee of UEFA has punished with two games the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic are the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the rules non-écrites, but followed, the sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case told is due to the fact that this has had as a team player as the entity of Real Madrid, which in its national anthem has the nobility and honour and in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode in the history of histrionic technician dilated and provocative.
In any case, the debate asked whether this type of behaviour not expressly forbidden by the settlement contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions it commits a fraud of law; because they are respectful shares with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The issue is to consider the kind of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
A property that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions had not been put in danger, that is, there were no violent game.
Another of these assets referred with the game is correct that the team players benefit offenders unfairly of the team contrary, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of players of Real Madrid is that it does not countenance to what is normally characterised as cheating o fraud law because its violation of the rules has not been conducted in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has specifically tried to be the most obvious possible to receive the penalization of the referee.
They expected and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the kind of advantage that offenders get the willful misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that are not put at a disadvantage to rival and there has an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action involves letting their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game not because the club could not count on these players.
The clear advantage lies in the fact that the players would begin the next phase of the Champions League without cardboards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of uncertainty, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action players perform a match penalty and spend the second cycle paperboards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation cardboards occurs with a less than in the first round.
So, climb the ladder, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still the same party strategic decisions that support the benefit as much as the rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of fraud the law), m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they are subjected to it.
They have made a strategic decision without penalty or evade the escape this.
Even if the border between genius and the fraud law is diffuse, in this opportunity I think it was a clear case of genius.
The controversy, I believe, is because of two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the Director to the cause.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendrier focused this year an avalanche of bookings for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-supporting celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the touron and the lottery, when December comes back as the groups before the Christmas dinner that continue to be the lifeline for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive te price adjusted to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
For complete complicate the accounting, the timing of this year (as on New Year's Eve falls Friday) has concentrated applications in the week of December 13, who as a result so far an avalanche of bookings dinners for the days picc (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the cause of hard times, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees do it by paying their own pockets.
No matter what is the situation, they are all prices for battle, confirms the President of Gremi of Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronale, now, dare not dare to predict what will be the holidays this month.
"People thought" much before reserve. "
"They want to get out but they pay much attention to the price," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality for good prices and with a good service," he added, and said that customers have the tendency to detrain a échelon with the crisis, so that the instalment of around €25 became majoritaire in the application.
In a poll in various institutions of the centre there is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is a true boom in applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with comprehensive packages of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 locations in the city (Hostal the Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the uniqueness of the calendar has assumed more advance bookings, even at the beginning of the month of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes of 19.95 to 30 euros," détaillent-ils.
NAs Grup, which includes El Mussol, QuQu Attic, and a total of 23 locaux, remains optimistic after detected a rise of billing for the second half and good, although concentrated, business outlook for the Christmas.
The sources of the group say that the 18 will also be a day hyper-actif in groups of friends who are celebrating in advance of the holidays.
In their six menus of group they added one for the noël, with 30 euros or more as budget famous and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as wine Catalan manufactured according to the method champenoise - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
From the patronat Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, ITPGR in the opportunity to begin to see the final of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animées", even if customers up to "negotiate".
This is true, the hope regarding the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, "he said.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad product of atomic weapons to "a faster rate than any other country."
The leaching of Wikileaks confirmed the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous preoccupation in Washington on Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the details illuminating and tasty that offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the volatile Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to complicate their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
It is as well that the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities of the territory under attack Taliban, the spread of nuclear materials including noise short and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and the curricula of missiles is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, and proliferating as a reason to maintain the custody.
"Pakistan has the hire staff with the strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; given the decline of cultural and educational levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who worked in the nuclear programs or missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Ministry of External Russian for a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of production of Pakistani nuclear armas.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues that "transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, said that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also calls in Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, understanding that it is "very clearly" in charge that "the Army of Pakistan should end with the tacit support to terrorist groups".
Hunting of the Head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for combating terrorism in order to avoid the new leaks.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and locate to Assange.
All aspects of Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" for "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but it dates from 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with the latest water-filtering more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the creator of Wikileaks lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 the international police body with headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the order to request of Sweden, but he has not made public until yesterday, having received permission from the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries have received an indication to identify and locate Assange "for its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanation of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a clear pathway to the arrest - the National Police must achieve - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is thought that Assange is.
The movement has outraged the lawyers Assange, who yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been willing to respond by video-conference questions from Swedish authorities.
They recall that Assange also sought and received a permit to leave Sweden the prosecutor in his case, comparing to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution", denounces the missive.
While the world the seeks - and Australia his mother defends his son's innocence Assange - continues to be in an unknown place, but it did not keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an interview at an unknown location in the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the secretary of the state of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it has been responsible for having give orders to the American graduates that they épient to the United Nations in violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should focus," déclaré-t-il for CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a high responsible for combating terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The spokesman's test of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the views that politicians and conservative commentators declare these days.
Peter King, Congressman that from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the Department of State that he is exploring the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to any person who provide their contributions or assistance".
Further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has come back to his statements after said that Assange will be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use unmanned aircraft or something similar".
A person who has not requested an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the Presidency.
"Anyone who is in the Government, which had leaked the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be a punishment too kind," déclaré-t-il for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with at the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more pluralistic and the end of the system of Assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt inside RCTs, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that its threat of resignation is not sufficient to the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time, it knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted his liar and that it cannot possibly give him headaches that he had with other common extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will win its new criticism with tacit eye that allows them to shield to the municipal elections.
For a start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisors of ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
By the ballot box, not by raising their hands.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote penalization to the President, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks to avoid the image of division and the submission to the person.
In several interviews he said that he did not consider them to be ratified with more than half the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "at the bulgare" would be good either.
People close to Carod the President a little more than put its position to provision of militancy, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós the expr control body between the congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to register with the executive a road map until May.
For that, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will present at the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of it to program the congress for the fall of 2011, what the leaders see as a fact sure.
The leader of CRFs admitted that the "polyphonie" affects the stability and that his goal is to ensure that, once and for all the organization is able to wash his clothes in the family room.
In this line, article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Puigcercós ideologue, the owner of Innovació felt that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if had done.
And it has listed five, which he said two.
The first, "reshape" the executive to he represents at least 90% of militancy, i.e., include new figures from the sector Carod sector.
The second may be the character of large news.
Huguet suggests that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he defends a reforme of the statutes that allow for the realization of congrès through delegates elected by elections.
Finish with the model of meeting, an exception in the party system Spanish, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congress.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 instructed the direction of revising the model in a Congress meeting specific reforme of the Statute.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of recent years did not recommend this topic.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time may be good for the resume and the close forever.

"At the moment it is accompanied the Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason to comment throughout the country, so that it was "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to the expectations".
When asked about critics of MICs against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked priistes to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; they begin to defend them; they leave 'cupboard," he says.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive may make those expressions as he did in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gags, and still less censorship.
Obama promotes in the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you agreed with the approval of the Act Dream Act, calls silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté US president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is meeting today at the national mobilization to support the Act Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agreed with the approval of the Act Dream Act, calls silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama.
The short message is keeping open a cyber relationship with a document further who asks the public to immediately contact the senators, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that they hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of tax cuts from the time of Bush and the financing of government is protracted.
Such a freeze, announced in a letter signed by all 41 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Act Dream Act and other projects as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking the Act Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is solved we can fix a agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think it was a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve this tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he says.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday it would seek a "vote of the debate" to the Act Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be passed from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the Law of Rêve American legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in the country in the past five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But the supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, in times when the partisan organizations project protagonists intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for this that supporters of the Dream Act requires the vote of several Republicans if other aviserne Democrats vote against the initiative.
Among Republicans the most courted there are senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux, Florida, which completed the mandate su Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have said they would not support it in another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported John McCain, did not define its position so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the greater challenges of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the littératures it puts the nail on the head
The second stage of the Fun of language has been a language in which participants displayed the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? that hopefully me?" said the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited has open the second stage of the Safe of language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for another foire the round table was dedicated to Sexe in the language, has expliqué-t-elle).
The nail on the head... we "embarrassment", launched the Argentine writer gently in public, most young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks know what is the "wound," it goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectiologue Sengamines convinced: "patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the trauma that has cut the blast in the middle of the corridor, but he explained that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on the wound I only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a beautiful narrative that he entitled Eloge to the invention, where the nail on the head is not nombré but at any given time is discovered.
With dabs of magic realism, he spoke of a famous ensorceleuse affecting clouds, was to return people who had gone or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the great news that has been from the beginning its own columnists and cited to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of the conquerors narratives of capitans.
"Cervantes we invented all (writers) was ridiculed false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre way would never be told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the modesty".
Nevertheless, has souligné-t-il, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, it is unclear how much of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction peaked.
People call this the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to its legacy that is what one story".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annoté and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The must on the wound.
The Cubaine-portoricaine has put his on the great plague of social violence that his country is going through - and Latin America share - produces fudges of traffics and selling drugs.
"I think the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not obviously premeditated," indiqué-t-elle, after quote that the reality of literature is the communication and the size of the commitment that is between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of it.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also highlighted "this must on the head of the writer committed".
It found that in a world that lives in high speed on the intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every claim there is a small and not behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must qualify: and means a lot of times put the nail on the head and disturb people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in black and white, in ideas established and without nuance and also disturb also the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he says, inviting to recover the meaning to write.
Romano the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, plus two different styles which face, marked by their technicians, who find them a marked contrast with the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series, although to date it has not placed in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
The Argentin eventually console with the medal of sous-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive final.
The strategist santiste arrived at its first final as entraineur Opening the Tournament in 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 it happened in decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, already in the Bicentenary 2010 Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered a new setback, because his team has done an equal match 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in a series of penalties he obtained an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and eventually three of his players have missed 11 metres and has suffered the jump at the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore it does not have the same fate, he tries to detach from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it is for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the helmsman when asked what would be its weak spots in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, which he assured that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson that we can accept is that until the referee whistles is the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line, players, too, for the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the match cannot be fêter."
He knows that the series could be defined by penalties, which do not worry, as he says in its players: "it never tries to arrive at a series of penalties, we are trying to finish in the scheduled time, but sometimes we have that we prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny we made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or anxiety to take the title in our hands, hands it has eluded us, it has served as a lesson for that final and we hope that we have more in those circumstances".
Romano now has the opportunity to not be a technician sous-champion and taste for the first time the glory offered by the securities.

In any form, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that have not our atmosphere.

14 Alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used in the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for the production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Surete du Quebec.
In all, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear in court in Sherbrooke in the hours following their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is information received from the public that allowed us to make the arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 officers from regional investigation module Estrie of the Surete du Quebec police Service Sherbrooke and the RAMQ of Memphrémagog, police took part in the police operation.
Illegal migration will continue without problem
The bill curators who, according to the government, should address the problem of ships laden with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten when the three opposition parties have reported Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support on the charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would own up to one year, a person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that it could not support the bill because it took on the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected out of hand the criticism that his party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take measures against the smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill conservatives because it takes to refugees and imprisoning the children for at least a year," explained Ms. Chow.
The Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and treating the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," responded the Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could lead the country in elections if its rejection.
A Conservative has, however, said the QMI Agency that the government would seek a vote for that each Member who oppose then explained to the electorate.
The new unit does not unanimous support
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York in this regard as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement Tuesday, has surprised many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police, Quebec, on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It does not need more if the péquiste critical public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, called the announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "bricolée solution on the corner of a table."
The Minister Dutil went responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the result when we will announce it, contente-t-il to say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Fullick, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," says about him Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break the impasse, it suggests in Quebec to give a special mandate the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," tranche-t-il.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the boxes of Government Charest.
Quebec also ask to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request came from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has meanwhile confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently studying some amendments relating to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, on biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not suitable, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently passed the Law on gangsterism.

The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes involved Dupont lunch" addressed a delicate subject fairly and appropriately. "
No blame has therefore been held against her.
The latest dispute was on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media standoff that had been a great deal of response.
The facilitator of NOH said he made no donation to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the truly needy people would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is a negative unfair representation of Haitians.
"I have served my suspension of three days about it."
"My file is blank for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounced the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, announce these decisions once during the primetime within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montréalais of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), and Thai boxing Kickboxing rises on the tatami mats and the rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts as the kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the city since 2008 to move among professionals."
"In my case, I am fighting everywhere, as for those who do not like the ground game in this mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as committed to the company UPS has just issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Championships of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of Kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing," he explained. "
"Right now, I am preparing to go to China for the World Cup in san shou."
"Fighters who have finished in the top four at the last world championships in each category were invited."
"I've won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, Vietnam, I finished eighth.
"In 2007, China, I found the tournament to fifth, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he said.
"What is interesting is that I have increased in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first or this time next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where the punches and kicks, as well as the projections on the ground, are permitted.
The shootouts are on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugiliste from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal did to remember that a single event in his career, he will certainly its presence in Super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the more fierce and most prestigious in China, explained the foc sympathetic."
"This is just the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stage of Thailand."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first semi-final struggle in its category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"Anyone who has defeated me was a true pro, he analyzed."
"There are four combatants by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners in the semi-finals final clash in their category."
"Then the winners of each category will face only to crown a champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 Million in contracts without bidding
'Hydro-Québec Gave over-thecounter 450 million in contracts to firms of engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, SM Group Axor and won the most important, that the management of the project, for a sum of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called Énergie stewardship has been formed in 2004 concomitantly the choice of Hydro-Québec to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy consortium won the lucrative contract without there has been no public tender.
For the Party québécois, the use of business Consortiums poses a serious problem'éthique threatening to eliminate competition and drive up prices.
"This is the new way of making collusion and kill competition."
"It means that people, instead of making it a secret, now do so openly," said yesterday the MP yesterday péquiste Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because it is difficult to see how the public interest can be used this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded by afternoon, vigorously denying that there has been collusion for this contract.
"I am beginning to have my trip," she pesté, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour".
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The Consortiums formula is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a limited alliance in the time allowed two or more companies to combine their respective expertise to meet a tender for a complex project.
The Mistissini project contains a high level of complexity given the scale of work.
The site is under way and should run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition'agisse; there has been negotiations.
Also, the Consortiums formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for projects relatively simple.
As revealed last week, the formula of Le Devoir Consortiums in the engineering sector was being investigated the Government.
A quick survey of the Register of Quebec can count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau is working in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIJL +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single entity or Dessau.
In terms of the consortium stewardship, the Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay meets specific dynamic workforce and'Hydro-Québec responds in particular since the 1970s".
The boss of the Mistissini project, Réal Laporte, the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that frowned on the fact that the management agreement of the project management contract was awarded over-thecounter.
"If you're going to bidding and that there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important is the quality of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Énergie stewardship is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Party québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir were 109 engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin beat 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, 14 and 10 Tecsult Dessau, not to mention her participation in Énergie stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They totaled $12,783 449,358 783 344, including the contract to'Énergie stewardship of 295 131 $564.00.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPIs, Dessau, Group DM and Axor) are "well known in Quebec Liberal Party".
The Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that the "financent", he added that it was more a case of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "Green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The consumer québécois very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also to marks equitableand to écologisantes certifications to guide its choice.
Worse, even if it is bathed in a media universe where messages for a more responsible consumption abound, he regretted a lack of credible information, carence that it is even brake on its commitment, barometer indicates the responsible consumption, including the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say indeed not believe environmental commitment of companies like green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of the University Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers questioned the reliability of official certification affixed to the so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands if displaying as écoresponsables, said the Barometer.
In the same vein, the politicians' rhetoric on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
Information about responsible consumption, however, seems paramount to stimulate this part of the lively consumption by nearly one-third of consumers québécois.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient the ardour of 46 per cent of consumers.
This is the second identified by the brake Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are also wary of the alleged performance of green products or services sought to put their hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed mark of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At height of 61%, they have also promoted purchases with traders in their neighbourhood and privileged the food grown in their region, said the Barometer.
Greener and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint focusing on the protection of animals.
But his social conscience and ecological appears, however, remain outside his car, said the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Québécois reported having used public transportation or called for carpooling to defend their interests green.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in the comprehensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A loan from the state for the redemption of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec has been asked to commit themselves financially in the redemption of the cinema complex eXcentris by the Angus and the Parallèle Society, agreed to work together, but up to a loan only.
The Angus Development Corporation and the Parallèle, who hoped a donation of seven million of the Ministry of Culture to buy at Daniel Langlois the film eXcentris on Boulevard St. Lawrence in giving full cinéphilique vocation, do not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the gift expected, the Quebec government proposes a loan with the amount would be below expectations Initials, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion springs from pharmacies of the state.
A first action plan and a request from 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan has been sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society of Business Development culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the file of eXcentris.
He sent a final report about 10 days ago.
But the cabinet Counter-proposal reached the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the idea of donating the State should really be dismissed.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and Quebec objected to a direct investment of the State to support the redemption of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance building projects, which it had not done for other cinemas.
But several key stakeholders instead wanted a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans for ten years, has worn at arm's length the auteur cinema in its premises of the complex itself after having financed its construction, which could justify an exemption from the Council of the treasure.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting at Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to build customer loyalty.
The Angus and the Parallèle Society, led by Christian Yaccarini, fly, for their part, a fundraising campaign in private sector, hoping to collect $700,000 to push to the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, The Parallèle, continues to distribute films to eXcentris.
The aim of futurs acquéreurs is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February in projecting the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is unclear what he and his group believe proposals to the decline of which they are made.
The lifted the veil on a Canada complexed...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States consider the inferiority complex of Canadians with the Americans, but they betray at the same time the sense of superiority of them to Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that each voter has not Canada-U.S. relations in mind voting, and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington over the public yesterday, offer more titbits that content to come under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in full federal election campaign, recounts how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador based in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"A Canadian inferiority complex almost inherent is, perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic challenges of everyday life rather than to wear this election on the United States (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988)," he writes.
The United States is, he adds, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk".
The ambassador is even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he says, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind in voting."
Another expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in early February the vote of confidence on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade due to a stimulus package of $30 billion to $40 billion," writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being ousted by the coalition and the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington the increasingly negative image that the drama series aired on CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or abductions for CIA interrogations.
Another cable said that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, is it writing, "he presented a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file".
Lastly, the minds heated up on the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the responsible for this massive flight should be "murdered".
It echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global plan to renovate Lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday to Cancún a renovation plan of the domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional reduction that we need to achieve to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
The ambitious plan is in the wake of large concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize yet 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs or, better, by blisters to light-emitting diodes (LEDs or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GtCO2) of GHG issued on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the largest emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are projected to reduce overall emissions of GHGs 53 GtCO2 to 49 GtCO2.
But he will remove this bilan still 5 GtCO2 in order to stabilize by 2020 the climate increase to 2 degrees Celsius to avoid it gets out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates as heat and the rest, or 5%, a product of the light.
With the bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, it reduces the need energy twice.
The bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that launched the manufacturer Philips this week - the company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the economy as possible with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to issue very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations against the bulbs because they contain mercury and that we must eliminate them as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place orders.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
The United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 metric tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through the international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would be 2.5 billion.
The Côte d'Ivoire waits in the nervousness the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, claimed the publication "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce interim results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the United Nations. "
"He calls on all parties and the institutions to act responsibly and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of preliminary results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of midnight without publish the results, three days after the polling of Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the chairman of the IEC had said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have increased Wednesday in the world for the CIS redetermines finally the name of the winner of the second round between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara the opponent.
But the camp Gbagbo relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council votes "fraudulent" in the north, held by the former rebel forces of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters practised by the NFs in the north of the country had discouraged supporters of the outgoing president to vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
Yet opponents of Gbagbo believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, North man who denies any link with the former rebels, has deemed "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it is not gone so far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of results because he knows that he has lost and that complain to the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission to release the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, Sunday, was supposed to top the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32 per cent to Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first round.
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd Quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted (CVS) provisoires published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolitan France.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In a year, the unemployment rate is rising 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and that they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate increased to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 point on three months, + 0.5 point on a year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 million young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The seniors have known for their share a slight rise in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+ 0.2 points in three months and a year) or 482 000 people 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49 years have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter, to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point on three months, + 0.1 point on a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE does not publish more monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after an argument on its methodology.
Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Union, continues in contrast to do so and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8 per cent in France (DOMs included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years, leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the General Council of PS Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and interned in the SIZO-1 of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged procurement fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been placed under investigation for abuse of social goods, misappropriation of public funds and assets concealment, bribery, influence peddling and detention of ammunition, said his lawyer.
"Fighting is Alexander Guérini and wishes to explain all the questions that the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to continue for a multitude of heads reprehensible, it is something the prove", told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, through his lawyers, to be passed on to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been indicted on Wednesday evening and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never been anything other than operate landfills that he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or to the destination of funds related to their operation, it has never been connaissance, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of Aubagne Agglomeration, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the record.
"My client was able to provide explanations to the charges against it."
"The judge has considered in did not depriving of freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placed under judicial supervision for two of them, "said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the cleanliness of Marseilles Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "graft and bribery".
Two officials of the town of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted the one for "embezzlement and theft of public property by a person charged with a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been charged with "concealment of misuse of public funds".
Among those who have been facing Mr. Guérini Figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained in a parallel case of procurement fraud relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect its companies have used to launder money of organized crime.
The investigation is being carried out in the course of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 following the anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement, particularly in the waste stream.
A source close to the investigation, the investigations focus particularly on the eligibility and functioning of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than 10 months from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "'espionnage", held the opinion in breath in France, put diplomacy on alert, diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the gaze of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, up to give advice for the treatment of their own crises "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not resulted in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the United States justice for trafficking materials to the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a harsh spotlight how the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, there was nothing.
A diplomatic cable written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostages".
The Elysée adviser for the strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French Method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their nationals forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "martelez" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as Iranians are asking you not to do."
, Because past attempts of discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve nothing", the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian tactic familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will speak on 16 August, when it takes refuge in the French Embassy) "will require the payment the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230 million euros of bail).
And he said that the Elysée anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the United States called for the extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris by order of a judge.
The American Embassy, as many observers wondered about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, who stalks the clandestine networks Iranian acquisition of equipment for the nuclear programme, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France agreed a deal?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, has not only been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision ", but has sought to oppose it.
"There have been heated exchanges between the French presidency and the guard seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot revisit the decision" judiciaire, observe-t-il.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "narrow" French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser composed a telephone number, tie, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée Palace has spared no efforts, through releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a role "important" and "influent" "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several newspaper articles reflected the French official version.
A telegram, dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the 'official' French media blitz".
What draws so many "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French officials acknowledge privately that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually".
The document then examines the reasons that led the Elysée remittable in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," analyse-t-il.
A policy launched in 2008, who "had been seen by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited".
In "exaggerating the Syrian role in" exaggerating ", Paris is seeking to" demonstrate to Syria what praises it can get by playing a constructive role in the region ".
The goal is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. embassy knows good source.
On 11 August, François Richier had told him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked all the anyway."
"This should at least confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
The receives Nicolas Sarkozy to the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role for the release of our own".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law known as the "Cinderella" that will ban teens playing games on-line after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request the online game companies to block access to these games after midnight, youth under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"A lot of children play in these games all night and then difficult to study at school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin Ministerial-level, the official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking the companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents demand, added the official.
It will also make available to the people who need free software that will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "connected" and newspapers regularly report facts related to various intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world events online gambling.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, with 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: FIFA means the country
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee means Thursday, the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where struggles for influence and lobbying are likely to overshadow the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the edition of the 2018 FIFA Queen competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its introduction in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the extent of the economic issues and policies of the World Cup.
Backroom negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the report, the FIFA English, Spanish-Portuguese, (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations do not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii), could have ruined the chances of his country, cradle of football that has hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC has presented a layer, Monday, releasing a documentary that three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What upsetting FIFA and embarrass the English officials, which embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who was awarded in 2005 to London the organization of JO-2012.
This intense activity suffira-t-elle to burnish the image of England to the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Espagne-Portugal is no shortage of assets with its stages already prepared, its expertise in Spain (Mondial-82, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 Portugal) and its culture foot.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only raise the rating of Russia, become an outsider weight despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the journey to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a thinly veiled reference to the English press charges against members of the EC.
"On the covers of mud, trying to compromise," said Mr. Putin.
In 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, have emerged as the favourites logical.
First global economic power, seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a head start on Japan and South Korea, who built separately a beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries who co-hosted the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of Mondial-2026 to China, eagerly welcomed by FIFA, which would effectively nullify the Asian chance for 2022.
With Qatar, which put out the great game by offering futuristes instars, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but the two countries have more risk than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquitted (because of jet lag) by European countries, the sinews of war to FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
Actually de Gaulle had hesitated.
Mitterrand was led to believe that he was reluctant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than men.
A mandate to the Elysée deserves another.
So the current head of the state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix with the part of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then we must act as if the doubt still existed.
In a sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy was that it would make its decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
It evokes before parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a bit of volatility.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was a long way away.
The President does that remind you that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of quinquennats.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he evokes the présidentielle, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you again for seven and a half years with me", he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "do not believe that I do not think the step after."
His remarks before yesterday do not make more candidate than the day before; they do not make less.
If they are comments, it is comments with a dual purpose.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination to PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the introduction of Ségolène Royal, which grows Nicolas Sarkozy to come forward.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many at PS demanded a formal order of battle earlier than planned.
The bad polls.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of French President Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to BVA-L' Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion within the UMP on that," responded immediately and carefully around the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the defeat as possible, it will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always believe they can win", corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: forced the ECB to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the terms out of crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of operations unconventional monetary policy must be achèver at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis requires, the institute of Frankfurt may not afford to be in such a sweeping only worsen a situation more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political costs would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has also welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the crisis of debts of states in Europe.
She was unwilling to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, such as increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show more disert about his intentions, saying only that the programme of buying government securities in the secondary market "continued," and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent, its lowest level ever since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of government bonds by the ECB have doubled last week, to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market participants, it would have made new purchases of securities purchases Irish and Portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystème purchased $67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market participants, expectations of further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Not most economists do not expect significant change of course.
If the loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the past is still to allowances of unlimited liquidity on the conditions and generous for periods from a week to three months.
Economists now expect that the scheme to be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it alters significantly its programme."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter 2011 seems more likely," anticipates its side Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the debt markets, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase these obligations to animate a sluggish market," said Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposure to markets of sovereign debt in the eurozone, the institute of issuance has no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs be a substitute for lack of investors in the market and act so to prevent a runaway yields paid by the most fragile States", was an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are soaring, the States will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government made the round dorsum
After an early week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little relaxed, yesterday, with the decline in bond rate in 10 years.
Cool-down a precarious calm.
Emerging from a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of region said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unbreakable" and expect a weekend "unforeseeably", which he then denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the German record 210 basis points and the price of contracts of hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, resulting in a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "greatly concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third eurozone economy, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the absence of a sluggish growth and tax revenues that goes with the State, posing the risk of not being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels have been a cold shower for the Government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1 per cent in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate on table 1.3% and 2%.
In these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will represent still 4.3% of GDP next year, compared with 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be put in place after the holidays, for $7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken", says the economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," ensures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, nor in the short and the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, class), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are lower than those made in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There is also the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of elections could be held in late March.
Then should open a period not conducive to decision-making in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of anti-crisis dispositifs
Christine Lagarde has been hammered yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I think we have yet shown Sunday in the day and into the night, are obviously solidaires, determined, pledged to defend their currencies and their currency zone."
Although any relative, the trigger recorded yesterday on the rates of European government bonds provided grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of an early standards.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade the note of the debt of Portugal, the target the most described today by the speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on the banking systems", say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially as "the time is much slower than the time of markets".
Aware of this gap and the dangers that it holds, the European countries to intensify discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers the G20 are going well.
And in this view also of meetings of the Eurogroup and the early next week.
The ECB meets Today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the eurozone countries in the sights of markets (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors extrême-orientaux developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly the ground.
The first of the EFSF emissions are planned next month.
Yesterday, a US official told the Reuters news agency that the United States would support a possible increase of funds raised by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
The countries are first in line, Portugal and Spain, in turn, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, including in terms of organisation of labour market.
Reforms in addition to the austerity measures with more to come.
Lisbon and Madrid want to follow a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
The two are at all costs to avoid seek international assistance before setting up their own budget adjustments and decide on much-needed structural reforms to restore lasting confidence.
The European donors, finally, talk on the options available to speed up the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
Visiting Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first suggested that if the €750 billion raised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to call out to the portfolio.
Economists from Barclays Capital, a player of any leading European sovereign debt market, consider that an increase of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle there: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism has, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council that is likely to be considered carefully in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions were getting worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in vigilance orange-mango
The snow episodes'engendrent still difficulties of movement, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert because of the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, have added to the 20 departments already in vigilance orange, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, snow showers supported affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and snowing lightly on the Île-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the relevant departments, and 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes of Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, the Poitou and those regions Basse-Normandie, 'Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The episodes are significant enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes of Armor, several have been banned on lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, of which the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult as the gendarmes who recommend not to take his vehicle only in case of need and the movement of certain cars ESTs was suspended for the day.
School transport have been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures planned Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of lorries.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel Thursday, 25 per cent of their flights on the Paris airport Roissy airport and 10% to Orly because of falling snow to come.
The DGAC recommends for air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport south of London, and that of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first drawings Financières
Since the time that the debate around the modernisation of transport in'Ile-de-France is in full swing, the skies billion.
In the discussion at least.
It evoked in particular 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro must build the Society of Greater Paris.
To start the GSP, the Government has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will in turn the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the funding of his double loop.
Today, it is the first additions.
The Finance Act 2010 rectificatory, examined by Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices provided to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax equipment and a tax increase on the offices in'Ile-de-France.
The first, according to the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: "the proceeds of this fee is $117 million euros per year".
The second is a redesign of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize it, to increase the product and affect the increase to the Society of Greater Paris."
How would that?
Mystery.
That is not in the text.
It is far from the $4 billion.
"It is clear that these tax resources in addition to the €4 billion of investment, which will be mobilised by the state and made to the Society of Greater Paris as the project," can be read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP, you do not find it shocking.
"From the moment we created (the two income taxes, Ed), we can cover the studies on three years then type in the 4 billion after, explain it."
"This will be included in the Budget and fired as".
The GSP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which the 4 billion pledged to subscribers are still absent, may cause a parliamentary discussion a little flustered.
First Public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers spies and spies in diligence
The case of WikiLeaks has a dual value.
On one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal before the hypocrisy that governs the relationship between the states, citizens and the press.
On the other, she announced sweeping changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the downturn.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is confirmation of the fact that each file compiled by a secret service (of any nation that it is) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report which for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and the eerily Profile caricature of Al-Qadhafi was long for the cabaret artists matière to sketch.
The rule that the secret files must be that new compounds already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore on esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeat (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the or the Rose-Croix Temple) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to make unpubl. research (nor knows where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those involved in the occult, only to what they already know, and reconfirms what they had learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret Files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or spirit limited) the head of the secret services (otherwise it might be, that sais-je, editor of Libération), which does as true that what he recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these issues have made so much noise?
On one hand, they say what any educated person knows already, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of States can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, except for a few small representation exercises, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer of films ofinquiry knows this, and it is only by hypocrisy that it pretends to ignore it.
However, the fact of the say publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to place in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can get any secrets more secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
As the scandal does not so much in crisis the victims that the "torturers".
But now to the very nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive of any power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely proved since, that can monitor each movement through the phone, every transaction, the hotel visited the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the crypts of secrets of power cannot escape the scrutiny of a hacker, the audit report ceases to be able and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as avenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the opportunity to retain its own can hold secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said already, that a true secret is a secret empty (and secret vacuum can never be unveiled); it is true, too, that know everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret vacuum of secret, because in the public domain; but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secret means removing any power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the states can no longer put online any information given - it would publish it on a poster pasted on the street corner.
But it is equally clear that with the current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state has shifted in aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future private reports and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my anticipation is science fiction and is therefore novels, but I am forced to imagine government officials who move quietly buggy in the uncontrollable routes, by not being that carry messages learned by heart or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in drawers locked: basically, the attempted espionage of the Watergate had less successful that WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now in crabe, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, Internet has restored a telegraph on son (voice).
The analog (video-cassettes) had allowed the researchers to explore a film step by step, by going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, but now the CD (digital) do that to jump chapter by chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, it goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in air travel, and it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary that the policy and communications technology in return for cars.
A final comment.
Previously, the press was trying to understand what was going in the secrecy of embassies.
Now, it is the embassies are seeking confidential information to the press.
Weather: how France bidouille its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the basis of promises of funding quickly released (so-called fast start funding early funding) made by the developed countries.
And big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7,2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (including 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU took out the great game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to the fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, great side event, distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency is welcome and Embraced: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries do the same with the same level of detail.
The EU announced have reached 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which puts it on the way to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", to ensure that an extra effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means to "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some member states including France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
The European Commission has, for example, regarded as a reference the year 2009: international funding are maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" the year 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there was no reference to previous years' expenses or the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of support of France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), she claimed its commitment to funding "new and additional"...
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 €Loaned amounts to €1.
Of course, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigating emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is disingenuous to present a euro that it will recover as equivalent to a euro that it gives... Any at most, should not be counted under its commitments that the cost of borrowing for the country lender (equivalent to a rate of interest).
But France did that make such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros in doing 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use if heavily the loan.
Germany are requiert to 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is €1 to meet its commitment, France does that 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
In summary, in its financing fast start, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and on the other hand, the financial reality of the effort.
By not spending that 36.1 million euros, it comes to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because, it seems that it is Bercy that has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why other States members would continue to give it is sufficient to lend?) and in the negotiations because the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is not a small issue, on short term compared to overall discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the vast machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Nevertheless, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in the way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect its commitments and equity with other EU countries.
But above all, France could advance discussions on issues of long-term financing (other crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the accounting treatment loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues than it is in others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary for progress in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by Children
A 10-year-old child ingests in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published Wednesday of the association Generations Futures (ex- Movement for Rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistically significant value under the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", purchased between July and September foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child a decade in supermarkets the Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as candy, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet of the base is overwhelming: 81 chemicals including 42 are classified and five possible or probable cancer-causing substances that are carcinogenic some and 37 substances that act as endocrine disrupters (RIs), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually, are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or PE is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven Carcinogens as carcinogenic some as well as nearly 20 Residues likely disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as snack by the study, shows signs of six chemicals including a fungicide yet banned in France.
Same thing for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak haché, canned tuna, and even the loaves of bread and the chewing gum were littered with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the consideration of the plastic base used to warm the microwave meals in was not free.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminants" cocktails "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
