What are you going to do? the Social Democrats (ČSSD) in Prague does not know Voldemort or patisserie
The new councilors in the capital city of the Social Democrats (ČSSD) will have to overcome a language barrier to in Prague 's Council and the once understanding of their colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Aktuálně. Cz new members of the Council of the Social Democrats (ČSSD) of the `` tested ," as they know the notoriously introduced slang, which was created in the town hall in recent years, when Prague ruled the coalition partners.
A coded dictionary, Prague 's political elites introduced during the previous eras of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters and situations kauz in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councilors known concepts too does not understand.
At least that 's what he says.
`` Who 's Voldemort? "
`` I do not know. "
`` I am in Prague 's politics more of a rookie, "responded to the test of `` kmotrovského" of the vocabulary councilors for Culture Lukáš Kaucky.
And as the political veteran, responded similarly, Councilman Vladimír Březina.
The need to the concept of `` golf hole ."
`` It 's the only an expression of those, what i suggest, which sometimes use. "
`` Otherwise slang in general, i. "
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktuálně. Cz published this year in June before the election of Congress ODS, chose the offices of six examples, mostly of those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Town hall.
The Socialists have to explain the concepts of `` Voldemort ," `` the biggest golf hole in Prague," `` go to the candy store, "`` bull throat," `` betrayal of the capital city "and `` oplechovat."
The three of the aldermen with a pop quiz agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, which has to run the show pražskému education - first interview promised, later, but did not answer the phone.
The fifth councilors Petr Dolínek straight test refused.
`` These things do not care and how to enjoy the Civic Democrats, i will not be assessed. "
`` I do, how we understand each other in the framework of our programs, "responded.
As already mentioned, Councilman Lukáš Kaucky would in the title of the supposedly could not recognize that 's speech to the influential entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora Bém Romano Janouškovi.
`` "Voldemort Kauckému he says nothing, and the only term that in the test of correctly guessed, is `` the biggest golf hole in Prague."
`` It 's the tunnel, "says Kaucky, and now, he adds, `` but i know more from the newspaper."
`` I will have to pay a language course, "joke.
Golf swing then as Blanka tunnel administration decrypts not only the matador Vladimír Březina, but also the Environment Lukáš Shy.
Both of the Social Democrats then they know who actually Voldemort, and Luke Plachému is familiar also where this figure to find - a sense of the importance of the term `` go to the candy store. "
`` I think i will go to some of the Prague 's company, "he' s shy close behind the seat of the Janouškových firms.
They agree with Březinou recalls that knowledge derived from the newspapers, rather than to such a dictionary used.
In the social democracy in 12 trainees test no such familiar vocabulary slangových expressions does not exist.
`` I have even with his colleagues, but it looks like that really we do not have anything like that. "
`` We are rather names, sometimes used abbreviations and distortions of names, "says the Chairman of the Prague Petr Hulínský, which partisans dubbed Hulda.
`` In school told me Elm, but i do not know if you call me that even colleagues, "says the nickname Vladimír Březina.
The daily Aktuálně. Cz name tried and works.
Councillor Weinert is for straníky grandfather or less friendly, assembly Miroslav Poche, which before the election said fraud while sponsoring side, has for some of his colleagues the nickname `` Igráček ."
Nicknames are also, all that the Social Democrats in the internal language concede.
They can not hear Hulínský prophetess love, but the daily Aktuálně. Cz and noted another of the Prague 's chairman.
`` The doctor obuškového rights "he recalls that Petr Hulínský received its title JUDr. at the Bratislava police academy.

The older man, walked out the door client company RPG flats `` uhlobarona "Zdeněk Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a folder and in her new lease contract to three housing: his, her daughter and her son, who is in the enforcement of the sentence.

But the man over a wave of his hand.
`` One says it, the second it, "and scowl.
Ostrava region is becoming a major laboratories deregulation.
After the new year 's waiting for the vast majority of apartments, which are in the Czech Republic has not yet non - market rent.
Aktuálně. Cz has therefore decided to visit the `` laboratory "personally.
Havířovská the RPG is one of the total of four in Ostrava and Tuesday at nine in the morning is full.
Right next to the door is the security of the Security Agency, with her photo machine.
`` The rent 2011 ," the special button on his contact display.
One tap and from the press gets a piece of paper with a number.
Can not even read `` 157 "and your figure already beeps on the big screen, under the ceiling of the waiting room.
For half a second you are on.
The rent, after a moment comes to ask the older married couple, `` in the waiting room, but the new hiring apparently not concern.
Most people came to address the current problems as ever - repair requests, an insurance event, and the like.
By letters with new nájemními contracts are in Ostrava into the mailbox tenants of the majority of the total 44 flats portfolio RPG from roughly half of November.
RPG flats them in the letters proposes to increase of about 15 to 38%.
Special barrier to new nájmům was at the center of the client opened on 18 November.
`` It 's running over a week, so it is only in the run - in, "the worker behind the desk after a moment' s hesitation, when the client will present as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalovy former mining flats are local excitable topic.

The most, according to workers are coming pensioners, to be sure, whether they will get a discount from the hire, if the sign in time, as the RPG in a special menu promises.
Half a discount on February rent, they also other tenants who new sign the Treaty by 15 December.
`` Havířovská deregulatory "bulkhead but queries congested certainly is not.
`` From yesterday 's 360 clients here for the lease in 2011 was only about forty or fifty people, "estimate worker behind the desk.
RPG on the Web and their nástěnkách proposes a negotiation of individual contracts, where it will be needed.
However, if the lease on both sides agree, it will have to establish an independent court.
`` This is not a threat, but on the information about the possible only and entirely legitimate legal procedure, "says the RPG on its website.
`` There 's no one will judge, "one of the workers RPG apartments, and the man in the street in front of the client center, she is partly for the truth.
`` I have got 13,000 pension and left me five thousand on food, i have to say, "he says.

While in five years between 2005 and 2010 could RPG of rental flats to invest in four billion, for four years from 2011 in 2014, it is to be 5 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling on the opposite polstrovaným sedačkám havířovské waiting room yet repeated several red highlighted information.
`` The increase in the rent in 2011 about 15% and less on 31 200 apartments, it 's more than 90% of the apartments RPG. "

`` In such cases is an increase of extremely low amounts of 19,66 CZK per square metre, "says the RPG.
For the next year 's rent apartments 2600 remains the same.
RPG flats promises that deregulation pushing rents in scale, but it will be distributed in four to eight years.

As a matter of priority is to get people to sign an agreement on the increase in the rent.

The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. look into the interior from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of ancient lizard, staircases reminds the backbone of Dinosaur and balconies are open to fish mouth.
This is the house of the Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the catalonian Antoni Gaudí architect.
From the local house, thanks to its organic shapes called the house of bones.
Organic forms, wild colors, an unusual use of stone, fragments of kachlů and mosaic, facade of scales and pervasive soft curves, all this is typical for secession Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house making a dreamlike line, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of the nature and animals.
As you can see geometričnost, rhythm and exactly a coherent procedure.
On the night of the facade home sounds more dramatically, is nasvícená so that the impression of color still potentiated by.
Winding up and twisting shapes in the same way also appear in the interiors.
The wood in waves copying the window frames, rail, decorative elements of the door, the Watch and bar.
The house Batlló, which is in the area of Eixample to purchase a busy street Passeig de Grácia No 43, a conversion house from 1877 from the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction of the two years, and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on old buildings and the construction of a completely new, but it soon Gaudí accepted the idea of the unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Apartment house Casa Batlló but Antoni Gaudí design it alone.
He cooperated with him architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It is on his projektantském plank arose decoration for Retail apartment owners of the real estate, use of mosaic on the facade.
The facade worked as a number of other writers and artists.
The common work on the proposals of the house Casa Batlló was triggered by the successful cooperation with Jujola Gaudím.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house Gaudí Casa nice and park Güell, in which they are more Gaudí works.
From the local house, soon after the completion of earned by its organic shapes the nickname `` house of bones. "
Others are due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows came to call `` zívajícím house. "
It is also said that at the top of the building 's vypodobněn sword St George, patron of Catalonia.
The hidden motives contain religious and other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house suggested the unique system of central heating with odvětrávacími vents and typical of chimneys.
The bizarre may seem their forty - five - degree slope.
In the formation of the Gaudí absolutely not respect the building codes and leave them tie.
At the beginning of the construction has received from the town of a building permit, but it referred to the data on the planned reconstruction were vague enough that two years later in the completion of the City Council was the result of horrified and sought to remedy.
Councillor mind, for example, that construction intervened pillars and into the public the sidewalk.
To remedy never took place, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the invitation parts of the city 's Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully) received permission to hire two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself into lower levels.
In the gallery on the second floor was the and on the third floor bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The whole house šestipatrový intersects the staircase, which could be climbed up on the roof terrace.
The essential elements of perestroika was lifting all right angles and direct lines and their replacement curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the concept of a modern interconnection of space.
Social part of the opening of the door orchestr can be quite link and greater, the company can easily communicate, while at the same time, to the privacy of the necessary for a more intimate talks.
The house with Gaudí conversion, in addition to the new facade of a non - traditional roofs and two floors.
Impressive is also Gaudí game with the light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is in the inner court, and skylights.
The game two colors, he adds a maximum of light in all floors of the house.
It was simply bet on the principle that white reflects the light of more than a dark, which the sun 's rays, on the other hand, absorbing.
The house of the Casa Batlló, who was in 2005 included in the UNESCO World Heritage, may each visit.
On the first floor of the house is the largest and grandest apartment made available to the public.
The owners are for this step decided to in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of a hundred the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous artist.
In the case of the inspections remained, because they found that it is a very good company, and the spread of common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the memory of it certainly is not negligible, 16,50 EUR, students, pensioners, the group and holders of tourist průkazek have a 20% discount.
The sum of more than the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the town.
If you want to taste the right of the house with the dragon steeples, you must be quick to make friends with one of the population of the building and to visit him directly at home.
How to choose the mattress and grid: women have requirements other than men
Rather than its tupolevs the bed frame, but the quality of lehací area, i. e., the mattress and grid, give the basis for a really good bed.
They must, however, be harmoniously complement to meet the specific user.
In the selection of the casting lots of things, from a height, weight, age, health, and gender owner.
An important is also the type of the interior, in which the mattress and grate buying.
A typical example?
The need for weekend cottage where regularly heated, are not suitable latex mattresses, because they are more slowly, `` warmed ."
Moreover, they tend to have a significantly higher than the standard PUR mattresses.
It is necessary to be regularly.
If they do not have a lot of the dump channels, in the core, and is still lies on the board, holds humidity: could be under them appear even mold.
In the selection shall also habit.
Who spent time abroad, where are often used a lot of high mattresses are změkčující layer, it 's hard to feel good at low and with a hard surface.
`` All the players who were returning from the NHL, to me, that 's sleep. "
`` In my battered shoulders, heels and sides needed mattresses are změkčující layer of lazy foam. "
`` Such is recommended even for people with diabetes, who have the failure of the nervous system, so that it is wrong, information 'from joints and skin, "explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which is the upholstered furniture.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers, therefore, years ago mattress with lazy foam was looking for.
`` It 's okay, proper mattress has to Tempur, italian Magniflex, but also czech Tropico. "
You do not need to be a man of the NHL to appreciate the lazy foam.
The `` miracle "works simply.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape absorbed by heat, or to adjust to your warm body.
Do not you press forward in the night, you will tumble as a game.
Just get better sleep.
Lazy foam works as a protection against proleženinami.
In the selection of the size of the mattress with his height add more feet in length, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
The man and woman with height around 180 cm so they need to bed 210,220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at dvoulůžka 90 cm, together, 180 cm.
In a separate beds, for example, in the case of singlistů, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For the comfort of a possible visit.
`` It 's rule for beds simple: in Straw should have hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow, "says Ing. Helena Prokopová, cechmistryně Guild čalouníků and decorators, which is the subject of a healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture for a number of years, and he teaches at her professional schools.
In the case of dvoulůžka needs to each of its own grate and the mattress, here, however, watch out for the purchase of the to reconcile the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will not be anything other than the gratings fitted into the various heights, it is you, however, each in a bed frame.
Foam mattress should be at least 14 cm, types with spring of the skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on shaping and hoeing layer.
`` At the touch of her hands or landing on a mattress certainly do not feel springs, "says Helena Prokopová.
Each of the mattress requires a type of the grate.
Celočalouněná beds, when the mattress and basis are like together with the Siamese twins, they are in the bedrooms what to do.
The mattress wrong větrají, could not wash their skin, which has already today is normal.
And because of the night normally vypotíme 0,2 - 0,75 L sweat, it is clear that so after five to seven years of the mattress begins to remind one big (and clogged) the sieve.
Therefore, the experts refuse to advertising slogans about the life of the mattress to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantees.
It is, however, but their.
And, therefore, the Council of practice from sellers: the mattress a breadth 120 or 140 cm Hygiene and work detachable coating give up, but add rather mattress pad, which can easily be removed and wash.
Even if we produce mattress covers the zdrhovadly around the circumference, so after the opening get two parts (for washing machines and the size of the very important!), yet he could manipulation with larger types (and in one person) to shoot remind the light weight in the ring with a heavy.
You are in bed place the grate solid record?
Never!
Up on the bed for a visit to the one night.
The board, however, please (if it is already have) ventilation apertures and use the mattress with spring, and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from him. Taschenfederkern) and hoeing layer.
The PUR mattress on this basis does not cover.
The nepolohovací laminated grids, 14 to 18 vanes will be appropriate latex or sandwich mattress (like a combination of gum and coconut), but always with you shall pay the gratings with more lamellae, 28 even more, where are lamels in the area of the shoulders square, and it is possible to regulate their stiffness.
In the ICU laminated gratings does not cover the mattress with spring, because the point to react.
In addition to the setting of lamellae they, too, i. e., the shoulder cradle.
It is a special anchorage lamellae, which allows you to push, or even lean lamelu so as to shoulder the sleepers, `` he burrowed ."
For the men who have the `` shoulders across the back "certainly important thing.
Even at her memories of the producers of mattress, who in the men 's `` "began to use změkčující zone in the area of the shoulders.
The women also remember - those again afforded softer ground in places hip.
For the most discerning customers are intended křidélkové or the platelet gratings with the so - called multitorzním '.
The pressure is located in a more points and reduces tension.
Of course, as soon as you use on the mattress and grate bad pillow (big and `` plump "), most of the `` plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow to buttress his head and not only to my shoulders, in order to release the shoulder muscles.
As the appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer to, for example, in Scandinavia.
In the camp on the side of should pillow terms (together with the cradle of the grate or změkčenou zone in the mattress), the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses are with the original mattresses plněnými into something to do.
Their producers, more and more use of natural materials, or at least the matter.
The trend is just as well as in the mattress bio.
The raw material from oil, of which are produced polyurethane foam, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from skočce and soybean.
Just soybeans use all known producers.
`` Bio on the mattress, it means that the core is made of a material purely of natural origin, "says Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of the mattress ticking, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can get even mikrokapsle to relax by fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division of men and women.
While the men 's `` cool "plant extract of birch to cover the mattress absorbed the heat and cool the body, women, on the other hand, seat covers - `` awash."
The extract from the red chilli increases blood circulation, so it 's a weaker sex warmer.
Today 's favorite?
Mattress made of cold foam (has more pores with unbroken cellular structure is so prodyšnější than the current polyurethane and offers a better elasticitu.
A combination of different tuhostí cold foam "and `` lazy foam arise vícezónové mattresses, which they know exactly where it is supposed to be the head, shoulders and the foot.
For high - quality of the mattress pay so from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health of the parameters, they tend to have a lower rate of VAT, are treated as health aids.
As the first reached in the Czech Republic, this advantage Gumotex.
Economize on a mattress and grid is not easy.
Sometimes can be used to the actions of manufacturers or salesmen who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Need to tag Magniflex offers a mattress Duofreeze with sewn storage foam Memory to cover for 11 990 CZK.
Second, however, we can no longer afford a free of charge.
The era of lazy or of viscoelastic foams, with an open the cell structure and high density started the `` cosmic "pace material Tempur.
It was originally as material for NASA, because when it starts were astronauts exposed to an enormous congestion.
Tempur warm softening, in the cold, on the contrary, reinforces.
Warm the human body is so perfectly adapted and lay in his pressure.
It is therefore an ideal against the emergence of advantages include wider, but also to increase the comfort in my sleep.
Viscoelastic foam used not only on the mattress, but also on the health - care products, the need for a special pillows beneath the legs to relieve the feet and žilnímu system.
Domestic producers, for example, use of foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver, and the like.
The instruments for the monitoring of people want to increasingly parents, so they want to prepare for their children
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of watching over the GPS.
The system was originally created for the search for cars may have to follow the movement of people, and the aid should in such cases, which is the disappearance of the nine - year - old Annie Janatkové.
The device is not about the size of a box of matches, but soon, it may be the only as a watch.
A number of people scared case vanished Annie and began to the quest for resources, as their children better protect.
Even at the price of their privacy.
`` We are all say that it is not about spying, but on the next to reduce the likelihood that 's a tragedy, "says Petr sawdust of society, Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the czech market.
`` I admit that in any case, may result in abuse of such equipment, even if you are in the bag of someone who does not know about it, but we have not met with such a case. "
`` Most of it actually customers are buying for security reasons, "he added sawdust.
According to him, would always child should know to what purpose is `` the box "is used, and how to use in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that, if the child will not want anything like to wear, just to get rid of it.
`` Even very small children show great creativity in how some things on purpose to lose, when they do not want to be under control. "
`` Great expectations raised previously in my parents' cell phones, but which can turn off as well as the tracking device, "says Bočková.
In accordance with it is doubtful that in the case of the attack, indeed, such a device would help.
`` As regards the forthcoming kidnapping, it will ensure the perpetrator virtually always it that the child had no electronics, which would give away his position. "
`` It is now the phone. "
`` When you start to expand the tracking device will also find them, because of their sales must be supported by a massive advertisement. "
`` In this case, the criminals always one step ahead of the police, "says psychologist.
He added, however, that a similar device may help in the case of a sudden assault.
By Robert czechs from the company RC monitoring, which offers a surveillance services for both cars, so for persons, even in the event occurs after the attack immediately to the destruction of the surveillance equipment, may his presence of assistance.
`` The device can be set on regular sending position after a certain period of time. "
`` If the damage was done, will be available for at least the last position of the person concerned. "
`` Expensive device have built - in and náklonometry, so that even if he just slipped and lay motionless, send apparatus immediately warning with its position, "says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service may take a clever mobile phones with navigation, where 's record and special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units, is that it is either an instrument similar přívěskům size matchbooks or smaller mobile phones.
So there is a risk of their loss.
In accordance with the sawdust from Macro Weil, so that 's why now testing device - looking like a normal digital watch.
`` It will be the biggest advantage in that the Aggressor need surveillance equipment did not know. "
`` Or are known to after some time and it may have the police extra time, "he adds.
Whatever the tracking device developed into bracelets or pendants, they will still be using the same technology, which is used to baby - sit cars.
It is a combination of positioning through the GPS system (who use the normal autonavigace) and function of mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle reports.

The army has 225 stocks for years.
The problem is that the durability of cord 's two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought detonating cord from the public STV Group, a. s. for $40 million crowns.
The general staff in the grounds of the purchase of more incendiary lines MF Dnes wrote that the soldiers in training consume 60 miles detonating a year.
From the calculations, the army 's bomb, MF Dnes said, however, shows that, then it would be very intense Pyrotechnic training to each year through all the generals, officers command of an army, executive secretaries or cleaners.
Secretary of Defense Alexander Vondru and commander of the army vlastimila Picka itself.
Only then could be justified annual consumption of the army sixty miles detonating.
The length of the 25 grand explosions.
And even if it were, stocks of the army would be enough to maintain at more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, to the basic training for each new professional enough for more than two meters detonating cord, as they say experts, so the army fresh purchase ensure - even with increased consumption Engineers or special forces - 225 stocks for the years.
The soldiers Brigade of the Rapid Reaction Force, the Minister Vondrovi recently personally complained that have almost no bullets in small arms, so, too, are shooting, because of the need for money limited.
The lack of underwear.
`` I do not above my head, that he bought from us repeatedly so large quantities of fuses. "
`` But it 's their decision, and they know what they are. "
`` For us is an army of a good customer, which is as traders trying to comply with, "says business manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of miles purchased lines, and by the military will have the stocks of this `` ammunition "to at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, is only a four - year of the life of the fuses and police and military bomb techs even just about two years.
`` In perfect storage it may even be you four, "says one of them, who, as a soldier for criticism of the army does not want to publish the name.
At the end of the life of each ammunition carefully test, whether it is even more reliable and does not jeopardise troops to life.
These tests, however, are not free and cost more money.
Another argument Ministry 's bulk discount on 445 miles incendiary lines.
`` It 's cost us about sixty percent less than last year' s supply of nearly two hundred miles away, "it conveys spokesman Pejšek opinion of the buyer of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: annual consumption of firing sets of lines of police bomb, who destroyed the ammunition from the Second World War or here after the soviet army, does not exceed for several years of 1 500 feet.
And the police are always just such a quantity to this ammunition used before the end of the service life.
It worked her because of the safety of the bomb, and may, in a more flexible way to obtain more modern, and therefore also more reliable types of lines.
The Defense Ministry has already considerable difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the dvousettisícová czechoslovak army was preparing to draw on the Rhine.
The Czech according to the bomb, MF Dnes said, waiting for a few years, the same problem: will be eliminated, hundreds of miles of the old detonating, which now `` cheap purchases. "

His successor to the quiet year than we had in Farmetu
The euphoria of victory quickly replace the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the winners, sir, however, has Farmet worse times in a row.
For the price for the first place in the last year, the company 's Vodafone of last year in slavic house out of the firm' s owner Farmet, Karel žďárský.
Then the jury commending efforts, through which built up from a small nástrojářské workshop in the Czech Jiřího company with stamilionovými turnover.
`` I can say that the valuation encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our self - esteem for the game with the competition, "says today last year 's winner.
At the beginning of the company 's history Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered the father of Charles žďárského for Rent little business as compensation for the communists entertained assets, refused to career in the company, where he worked, and with a few friends around his father 's brother - in plastic bath.
Shortly after they specialise presses vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the biggest producer of automatic machines in Central Europe.
Greater awareness, as well as between non - professional public relations with the company after the achieved success in the competition through the media.
`` Not only our customers to mark Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that, cooperate with the company, which reached in the country 's major success, "says Charles žďárský.
Last year, however, was not in Farmetu only in the sign of the euphoria of vítězsví.
The use of the economic results of the company in 2008 and only partly from the year 2009.
And it is the year 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The height of the crisis, which is not so much from touching citizens, but firms have halted their investment projects and began to restrict the purchase of new machinery and technologies.
`` This situation is, of course, escaped or us. "
`` Sales dropped 40 percent, we had to reduce production and on layoffs, "explains Charles žďárský.
A viable, the company has to be able to do sometimes even such a unpopular measures.
The situation, but we made and the company keep profit, even if it is less than before the crisis.
Nothing, however, in Farmetu neslevili, 's investment in research and development.
`` From the subsidies, we make the research and training centre, strengthen the presentation on international trade fairs, received the award in the domestic shows, "says žďárský.
Indeed, the crisis is behind them.
Sales for the growing again and with them, the number of new employees.
`` The new winners have a pleasant feeling of victory, but in the quiet atmosphere, "says Charles žďárský.
Poll, which eliminates pointless rules
Survey of the absurdity of the year 's fourth part of the business, competition.
Some of the dense regulations have managed to cancel.
Neslavným winner next "by the absurdity of the year became the obligation to carry on the documents, which are also officials accessible on - line.
Decided on more than one - third of less than four thousand voting.
For example, the Social Security Administration requiring a paper excerpt from the Commercial Register, even if the official it can obtain two mouse.
Thanks to a survey, this will change.
`` The Czech Social Security Administration has already excerpt from the Commercial Register in controls on taxpayers premiums will require, "said a spokesman for ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
A light on all legislation and regulation, which must businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and you can cancel the competition is the point of the absurdity of the year.
It is this year for the part of the business competitions organised by economic newspapers and among the public is increasingly popular.
If the last year 's vote participated in about three thousand voting, this year, you have already been nearly four thousand.
And it is no surprise, various legal obligations, which serves only to delay of business, we still enough.
`` In the number of papers for tax return we are on the front places in the world, "notes to Karel Havlíček of the Association of small and medium - sized enterprises and grow in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business in the last few years have become the ostensible aim of all governments.
Compared to the world, but in the Czech Republic, the situation is much better.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic, from the point of view of the conditions for business has to 74. position, it 's about eight places worse than last year.
Competition of the absurdity of the year was first issued in 2006, and every year in progress, in accordance with the same scenario.
Log on administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone annually from April until the end of September, when it is closing competition.
The use of the address of the website www. firmaroku. cz after the competition organiser selects seven candidates for the `` anticenu "and leave it in the course of the October vote public over the Internet on the website www. firmaroku. cz / an absurdity and www. immediately. cz.
An absurdity, which can get the most votes wins.
In this year 's survey has been applied for more than a hundred, 105 legislation and regulation lacking sense.
Tips sent entrepreneurs, but also a professional associations, and journalists.
`` "Competition between the finalists were so between nominated found himself, for example, the requirement for wagons for the maintenance of new motorways and high - speed roads were tolls, or to entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two agencies and two toilets painted every two years.
List of this year 's sevens proposals is made public on pages of competition.
Competition, which is always in early November, the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a hapenningu, which regularly participates in of the political and social life.
This year, for example, for the climax of competition, assisted the Eva Svobodova, director of the Association of small and medium - sized enterprises and grow the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
`` Economic prosperity can not work where the State throws entrepreneurs in your way, because it is my view to cancel each year at least three decades of the law, which now only unnecessarily complicating the business, "said the Minister of Industry and Trade Marin Kocourek.
Efforts to disturb absurd regulation nevyznívá empty.
In 2007, most people do not have an obligation to notify the Trade Licensing entrepreneurs three days in office in the place where the permanent establishment, intention to go to the exhibition or Festival.
This obligation was removed an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most hlasovaná obligation in 2007, which was the report 's Labour Office for its foreign workers business trip to the extent of up to 30 days, it has been deleted the law on the so - called green card.
And three times lucky.
Absurdity of 2009 happened regulation fyzioterapeutům have in the office of a large mirror, refrigerator and two land weight.
It was this year, the decree of the Ministry of Health - tempered by an obligation to have fallen off the refrigerator.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Is assessed the environmental, humanitarian, educational and sports projects.
An innovation in this year already fifth year competitions economic newspaper 's category called responsible company by 2010.
The aim of this competition is to promote rational and a fair business.
`` We are as follows encourage firms, which take account of the effects of his business on the environment and support the socially responsible activities, "says Patrick - Bartholdy, regional manager mobile operator, firms Vodafone, which is vyhlašovatelem and guarantor of competition, as well as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
In this year 's first year of this special sub - categories of the main competition Vodafone company 2010 made themselves known companies, for which there is a success in the business of the long - term goal.
The story of each of them very inspiring and went on a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities from one another very different, for the common denominator of their efforts can be considered support and respect.
In one case concerns, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or the health of their own staff.
Between the two finalists celorepublikovými was, therefore, for example, the Prague software company and Netera that supports the creation of the informal sports teams between workers who are then take part in a series of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company of the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit - Bravo, which is already seventeen years a major contributor to the Endowment Fund sponzorujícího handicapped children.
On their disabled workers again the old paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent, and therefore has won the title of responsible firms in the Region of Central Bohemia and in the competition Vodafone, the company has placed in the region as a third.
The Olomouc region won accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which has introduced a flexible working hours, moreover, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without proportionately reduced salary.

`` In addition to the Foundation man in distress, which helps to specifically, local Roma community, "says representative of the company Ondřej dry.
Finally, it is also worth mentioning the firms washing and cleaning of Karlovy Vary region, which their employees in the form of above - standard bonuses contributes to their pension rights.
`` With us again make contributions to food, transport, and recreation, "says Josef Strapáč from bruntálské construction company Czasch, winner of the moravian - silesian region.
In the category of the responsibility of the year, the company has been automatically logged in all krajští contenders in the competition Vodafone company of the year, who completed the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it no later than 15 August promoters.
Is incomplete or incomplete replies to the questionnaire were then the excluded from the assessment.
`` If the representatives of the company 's reply questions, they could not competition of the responsibility of the company of the year, but they are not disqualified from "the `` competition Vodafone company year."
`` Separate log only in this competition is impossible, because it is the sub - category of the main competition of the company, "explains Charles Goldman from the Agency Bison &amp; Rose.
In the land of the Fund in Pilsen police arrested in a public competition
In the building of the Liegenschaftsfonds in Plzeň in recent days of the anti - corruption police arrested.
Handcuffs detectives on the local entrepreneurs in the media sector and businessman with real - estate Luboš G.
The reportedly tried to manipulate the public competition to the settlement of restitution claims to land featured in the competition for a specific candidates.
He had a Luboš G. pay half a million crowns.
`` As far as i can only confirm that the police against one person for an offence meddling in a public contract, and at a public competition, "said the head of the law of the Pilsen PPO Antony green, with the additional details with regard to the ongoing investigation can not be granted.
Šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs policemen after 24 hours, released for free.
On the way in which could affect competition, might be due to a minimum of official information, only speculate.
A spokesman for the Liegenschaftsfonds Lubomír black on the question of the law, said it to odloučeném the workplace in Pilsen actually police arrested, and that during a public competition.
`` It was a client, not of our employees, "said.
Public competition has, in accordance with the black correct name `` invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land, according to the law of the land "and takes place in the case of the land concerned more qualified applicants.
`` These people in the framework of the challenges of the offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than it was announced the value of the land. "
`` In accordance with the offered entitlements shall be established order purchasers and liegenschaftsfonds then transferred land person, which offered the highest rights, "said a spokesman for the Fund.
Luboš G. was probably the information to the challenges of applied, and because it is also authorised person, who bought a series of restitution claims, offered candidates for land, to participate in the competition.
For it is probably got severance payments.
That would explain that had been on the detention of such a large sum of money.
Luboš G. was above - standard contacts at PF in Plzeň in the past.
Was seen in the case of former head of PF Václav Sankota, which has been prosecuted for that, he published in the spare restitution claims, to which it was issued a decision on the location of the building.
It was then that gained Luboš G. from the Fund, for example, the land intended for the construction of a public communications, specifically in a place where should build access road to the industrial zone borská field.
Later, he is very expedient to a house in the historical centre of the city, who had the value of a much higher.
In this town hall had to proceed, because otherwise would land blocking construction threatened.
The housing připlatí hundreds of a month
Households will have to from January overpay, not only for all types of energy, but also for the aqueous and stočné, heat supply and somewhere to grow and rents.
The family will have to from January pulled out of Wallets up to hundreds of crowns a month of more than now.
Electricity more expensive up to 4,6%, the gas is about 2% more expensive, up to one - tenth in some cities will have to pay for the supply of water and often also hike fare from December delivery of the central heat.
Price increases electricity should households in apartments out a year on the stokoruny more than now.
The price of the force of electricity, all major suppliers reduce, is to blame, a significant increase in aid of the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular, photovoltaics.
The gas had slightly more expensive, at a time when people most drowning, and are so high consumption.
A year, then it must also be a hundred crowns.
While the electricity and gas more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of the central heating is different from the place.
Price increase is mainly a larger community.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns a month, moreover, by more than 1,000 crowns will pay the family in Liberec.
People of Prague again threatens to them by more than 9 percent more expensive and aqueous stočné, and in the case that the city will increase the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent připlatí change, not roasted 6,8 percent.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between lower.
In north Bohemia, which has now prices are among the highest, has the aqueous and stočné podražit about 7,4%.
Significantly, for example, may increase in the price of the rent in the 450 thousands of rental flats, where since January ends of regulation.
For example, the company CPI apartments, which in Ústí nad Labem own about 2500 apartments, intends to from January rent increase by up to one hundred percent.
Those who are not with the new amount of the hire agree, intends to give the company to court.
Regulated rent paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments, could be the next year will increase by up to 10%.
The czech children 's boozed fernetem and rum.' s beer out of fashion, with a slow
Fernet, rum, vodka, an even better brand of whiskey stolen parents.
These are the drinks, after which drinking ends most frequently in the care of doctors drunks, which was not even fifteen years.
The children of monkeys treated in hospital repeatedly.
It follows from the experience of doctors who with similar cases to meet the incomes of the children 's department hospitals.
`` Some beer or wine are completely nemódní, because long before they opijete. "
`` The trend is certainly the hard stuff, "said the law of the chief of the children 's department of the hospital Hořovice Central Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
`` If they can get out of the father of the cabinet, so it is necessary for the whisky, but otherwise dominates Fernet and vodka. "
`` The vodka has the advantage that it pour into juice, and it is not so much of them feel, "said the chief.
And for the truth is giving him as Speaker of the Faculty Hospital Sunbeam travel.
`` It is most often it Fernet or rum. "
`` It 's modern alcohol in school. "
`` In some cases the Mark, which he had brought from home, "said Jurinová.
According to the chief pelican are thirteen or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in a hospital income relatively commonplace.
Before Hořovicemi where operates from this year, he worked for ten years just to pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulance all podroušené students from a wide surroundings.
`` One girl with us lay about four times. "
`` Career has launched in twelve years, when it to us brought with 3,5 per mille of the blood alcohol, moreover, in combination with ecstasy, "said the doctor particularly a serious case.
`` It was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice on some dance party. "
`` It 's interesting that her mother did special, that his daughter 48 hours, "said the chief.
It is the lack of the parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking of their own children are often considered the main cause of the growing child pijanství.
On the basis of in the strict sense of the word, however, according to experts in children can speak.
`` Under the direction of an alcoholic means a multi - year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena, which it belong, and that in children 's. "
`` Those who alcohol used repeatedly, is more like a good family - social background, "explained the Pelican.
According to a spokesman Jurinové this year on pediatric clinic in Motol committed in mid - November roughly forty drunken children.
The statistics, however, will you with a heavy intoxikací, which had to stay in the hospital.
'S child drunks, following the ambulance treatment take parents and, where appropriate, is home to the police did not count.
Except in cases where the children just sit up after school and drank a bottle of brandy, there are in accordance with the first three seasonal fluctuations, to which we can rely on: a witch, New Year 's Eve, and the end of the school year.
`` Either celebrating the grief of the wrong transcript, or, on the contrary, they are celebrating the beginning of the summer vacation. "
`` But on a witch was on the income of seven children 's drunks suddenly, "said the Pelican.
A drunk, who spend the night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, is the advantage, paradoxically, by contrast, the next day at home suffer a hangover.
The morning headaches caused by the dehydration and lack of glucose, rode drip irrigation with glucose and nutrient that organism are missing.
`` They are at it better, because they are after that beautiful evening 's experience and good awakening and nothing is not hurt. "
`` Only the confusion of it, where they are, "said the pelican, with the occasional spoil the patient pleasant mood of at least a list of the costs, which their treatment required.
The ambulance and hospitalization at acute bed, will also on the tens of thousands of crowns.
`` I sometimes it operated as an educational resource, when i directly these children, then on rounds it calculates how much of their drunkenness and stood that could also spending the entire summer on the brigade, to make money on the one party, "he added Pelican.
Health insurance companies, however, according to him to s management, in which the parents enforce the costs of treatment, in cases of children 's drunks underwrite.
The two of l - 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
The two of l - 159 from a total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence an exchange of transport plane Casa c - 295 M, on Tuesday, left to the spanish Seville, where aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS.
It is the first time that the machines of this type of appeared in the ownership of someone else than the Czech Army.
In a foreign country has only been in exercises or presentation years.
It is a two - digit version of l - 159 T 1, which has not yet been engaged in the Czech Army and which were available.
The remaining three machines are a one - digit of l - 159.
While you are zakonzervované in Aeru Vodochody and the provider of trade - company omnipol - it took over the last week.
When the aircraft physically came from Vodochod, is not by Jana Pejška from the Press Department of Defense is not yet known.
`` Single aircraft L - 159 for shift were allocated from a long - term, the aircraft, and that without further deposits and investment by the Ministry of. "
`` The two L - 159 T 1 be converted into the current state and form, "said law Pejšek.
He added that the military aircraft without a two - seat trainers, because the Ministry of in May 2009 signed with Aerem Vodochody contract valued at $200 million crowns to rebuild the four unnecessary machines L - 159 on two of these machines.
One of the new plane was taken over by the Army in July, the second takes over by the end of this year.
According to the Pejška EADS, undertook to aeroplanes prevails in the armament of some of the NATO countries.
`` In the Treaty, it is clear that the buyer of l - 159 aircraft 's company EADS, and will be used for the training of pilots from NATO. "
`` It is therefore things customer, how this thing will be realized, "said Pejšek.
Reuters ahead of time indicated that, i. e. the spanish army of l - 159 has no interest.
The exchange of five L - 159 as one of the Casa and the purchase of the other three aircraft for 3,5 billion crowns approved the last year, the government Mirek Topolánek.
The Department of Defense nevypsalo for the purchase of a selection procedure and touched directly EADS.
The leadership of the Defense argued that shift will support the future of the export of l - 159 abroad.
Czech Army of Aero bought 72 machines and used only 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of aircraft Casa is likely to have, and judicial farce.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence sued for the European Court, therefore, you should choose the aircraft on the basis of a tender and not addressed one producer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last should at Prague Airport kbely come within a fortnight.
The longer the index finger than the ring finger indicates the lower risk cancer
The men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger, they are exposed to less risk that gets the prostate cancer.
It is surprising conclusion of the study, which was published in the center of the british magazine cancer.
It may be related to the surface of the male hormone testosterone.
`` Our results show that the relative length finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, in particular for men to 60 years, "said the co - author of study Ros Eelesová, Professor Cancer Institute at the University of Warwick University.
The finger might help determine who men should take the test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with a genetic risk threatening or other factors, such as the family health burden, she added Eelesová.
In the period 1994 - 2009 watched with colleagues in Britain, more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and in parallel over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the members of the study should index finger on the right hand of less than the ring finger.
Paid for them as likely prostate cancer as for 19% of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger, however, this risk declined by 33%, for a man in his late fifties, the decline in even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of these two fingers - shaped by prenatal processes - perhaps reflects the different levels, which is a child issued in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Early studies have shown that just testosterone supports the growing prostate cancer.
The leading czech geneticist and a former President of the Academy of Sciences of Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK he said that on this study, he knows, but is he says that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer was `` entirely proven ."

`` The soldier with her, in principle, be treated so that he would find a target, send him to the laser beam, which specifies the distance, so get your Advanced deliberate point, according to him, adjusted bearing and the trigger. "
`` Say that you are they measured 543 meters. "

Shortly before the withdrawal of the internet company Amazon documents Wikileaks from their sites.
Internet activists used in the publication of the secret of diplomatic trap Amazon Web Service (AWS), in order to cope with the high number of access to documents.
By using the services Twitter explained Wikileaks to this step: `` fine - our dollars now spend the zaměstnáme people in Europe. "
When the Amazon such problems with the freedom of speech, `` then should stop sell books. "
Amazon stopped the use of their sites for Wikileaks after he co - workers Senator Joe Lieberman have made inquiries, published a CNN, on the basis of the information office Lieberman.

The University of ice cream
The `` Gelato University "in the case of the Bologna preparing zmrzlinoví candy man to better annual period.
On the base course for future shake, which takes three days, it 's a big interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
Where is the ice cream?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Czech Gelatiere, a little obsolete zmrzlinář, produces cream according to all the rules of the italian zmrzlinářského art.
He takes Gelataio scraper of ice cream cooler, rubbed her into the waffles and sell.
To this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about ice cream, this will avoid the `` Gelato - University "the italian firms Carpigiani.
In 2003, a producer of ice - cream machines ice cream University to ice cream from his machines answered with all the italian high ideals.
On the base course for future Gelatieri, which takes three days, is a huge interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
It offers but also several days of special courses of chocolate ice cream and practice in their own zmrzlinárně.
Someone wants in his Midlife - Crisis into a new career, others venture out on thin ice obscure their desires.
This time it is 40 people from 19 countries all the worlds - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, the art teacher from California, he loves movement Slow Food and wanted to be in the future to offer a high - quality european product in the country 's industrial Ice - Cream.
Anke from Berlin 's business a consultant and would after years stressful job to start something of his own.
Two young Egypťanky dream of in Kairu open zmrzlinárnu.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of ice cream in its bars - and canadian homemaker Julia, because of her children love italian ice cream.
Maestro - Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain the participants in an ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also the silk softness and good consistency.
Do not forget, during his training on the southern and patriotic put the icing on the cake: `` the italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it was still notná dose of romance. "
The first step of the manufacturing appears to be relatively simple.
Luciano inserts basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a great mixer, which all by electronic program to 85 degrees and subsequently now cool to four degrees.
Then he turns to tap and comes a pasterizovaný white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk - based ice - cream.
Now it is Associate Professor caved in issues: it is possible to make an ice cream only from natural substances, without stabilizer?
How can a man alone experiment?
Luciano warns, to be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Who speaks about ice cream `` only from natural ingredients ," as used stabilizers - usually a natural product, as is Guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make an ice cream, even without stabilizers, but to sell in one day, or you will drive down and the customer her all grains of ice.
A variation of the matter is permissible.
More excitin 's will be with flavouring essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream, according to the ingredients to buy in a supermarket either in the department with fruit or in the Department of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
`` Suppliers trying to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients. "
`` You should be but simply experiment. "
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream of white fundamental matter, amend the eggs at the yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for some chocolate temptation.
Now, may be involved in the course of an ice cream machines.
Do it to make every four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lískooříškové ice - cream - either with eggs or without them in the mass, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall also be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée - due to taste it is always better.
Lískooříšková ice cream may enjoy more butter pecan, if it contains more hazelnut.
Most popular kiwi ice cream constructed group, which use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced combination of highlighting the right to Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice - cream is purely numerous task: when using a peach purée with a lot of sugar, it must be to reduce the share of sugar in the basic recipe.
In the case of lemon ice - cream is the need for an extra ration of sugar.
He takes Luciano machine, which specifies the sugar content in fruit (vintners the measured the must from grapes).
Fortunately, reduce the number of the table.
The production of ice - cream does not require much physical exertion as before.
Do not only instrument for the automatic production of the matter.
There is also a machine that a combination of ice cream at the same time umíchá into cream and cool to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation evasions small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo smear himself and his colleagues from top to bottom fruit purée, when he gets out of the control of the great mixer.
`` At any rate, "believes Maestro Luciano, `` it 's only a matter of time when this happens."
Examiners in duplicate light
The European Food Authority Efsa is consistent with the industry, which have been experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge now expressed the Group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent Institute for estimate of the consequences of biotechnology.
`` It sounds like a conspiracy theories, we are but well documented, "said in the center in Munich, boss Testbiotechu Christoph then.
The Head of the expert group Efsa for gentechnicky changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert Efsa have already for several years, the contract with the Union of lobbies Ilsi.
This is financed by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper contributed decisively to control regulations Efsa for genetic plants and is so in clear conflict of interest, by then.
The provisions Efsa to agree in paragraphs with the documents Ilsi and are so manuscript industry, which should be controlled by the Office in the italian Parma.
It is no longer a second time, what Testbiotech points to a conflict of interest.
Recently passed high, manager of Efsa without additions or transitional period of the swiss concern agrárnímu Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Also radio for Central Germany (MDR) has recently personnel link the EU - the Office for the control of industrial lobbies, which raised interest as the Department of Environment, so the members of the EU.
In the meantime, can not Efsa recognize the conflict of interest.
Working with all seriousness data, i. e., as well as those of industry, if they are highly technically expert, is set out in a statement.
From experts, who work for Efsa, are not required to have contacts with industry.
But it must demonstrate.
Kuiper confesses his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It becomes a neutral expert forum of science, industry and policy - in addition to estimate the risks of biotechnology without a contract lobbyists.
Independent experts as he criticized, that are currently vacation gentechnicky changed plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the reaction of genetic testing plant on environmental influences.
`` We want to know what to do, for example, gentechnicky modified maize in the field, "he says.
The current practice is the only test isolated proteins, not a genetic plant, which they can demonstrate reliable results.
`` If you are looking for risk, as it was then can find them? "asks fingers then.
Agrees Angelica Hilbeck.
A examines gentechniku since 1994, and is currently working on the technical high school in Zurich.
In this area is trying to industry, as in the US, now also in Europe still more influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are almost no longer scientists who would not be connected with the Hills.
It is mostly publish studies, which are critical for the company.
`` The industry controls the security research, "believes Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also some issuing a total of about 400 pounds.
On Monday night stood in front of the station in Stuttgart tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: in September arrived dredges and began to tear at a large piece of Northern wings.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands of marched against S 21, miliardovému reduction in the station.
When they reached the halt, lay the majority of the wings in ruins.
The broken to 6000,7 000 pieces.
The limestone from Crailsheim, soft rough stone, which was used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years.
He took a few of these pieces.
`` These stones are relics. "
`` It shall not disappear. "
Dissolve: `` cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial. "
When one, the smell after cigarette smoke.
What about those pieces of the will to do not know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trail of the stones from Stuttgart leads to the woods for TUBINGEN on the former deponii of the french army, where Manuel Rongen built her stone empire.
44 - year - old man deals with the old stones.
He bought all that emerged during the cutting in Stuttgart.
`` It would be a shame if rozemlely on the gravel or disappeared on deponii, "says in his office, wooden box, which was previously a house.
Says that he swore and threatening him, in September in all the papers, that he bought the remains of the Northern wings from the company, which carries out demolition.
But he was for days with adversaries with - 21.
And he explained that for the demolition he can not.
And when that happens, then it is reasonable, when the stones to use.
Then came about 200 with - 21 - opponents, each one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price of a piece of 6,50 to 14 of the euro.
As a memory, some, too, in the hope that he will come back again.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes of cargo, 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the woods, the rest of the time he sold.
Gardeners, krajinní gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners of the and dragged, what resided in the trunk, and to the caravan.
The dispute of Stuttgart, long a `` wall "or as a border, with herbs.
`` This stone, in fact, there 's nothing special, "says Rongen.
`` If it was not for the political inserts. "
Getting in its field of the car and go for a ride on a 20 - you hektarovém Kingdom.
He studied ahead of the law, interrupted study, later biology, then was interested in the computer and eventually became a trader with stones.
And lover of stones.
He has saved 40000 tonnes of stones.
Tie their treasures of the whole of Germany.
He says he 's largest businessman with the old stones in the Czech Republic.
Hamper.
In the snow lying artistically worked freestone.
`` Once belonged to Marien - bridge in Dresden, "says.
Sandman from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is happy.
`` My favorite stone. "
Let 's go up the road through the forest.
Show on a pile of: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
`` Nice travertine. "
Once belonged to the blocks on to the platform Neckarstadionu in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lay the stones, and stories Cannstatt - travertine from the police Presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronnu.
What kind of work as an effort, the sweat.
When Rongen thinks about the first hand - break stones and carried by simple tackles and bull carriages, it becomes a respectful.
`` It is not a scandal, if something like that crashing. "
I became rich, very rich.
A businessman with stones now employs 14 people and, in addition, the top in the forest clearing the masons, a sculptor, one of the smith, one Sklář and a gardener.
`` We are working hard, but it is satisfactory, "says that, who has appreciated remains.
In the foreseeable future must to Cologne.
Also, there will be a bailout of the stones.
The battle of talent of the High - potentials
In the case of refreshments is a lot of people.
16 students is pressing for salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
Technical University in Braunschweig and auto maker 's Volkswagen invited students engineering and design on the workshop.
Together with the company 's here to talk about the car of the future - and by the way to get to know the Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to in the establishment of the smartest heads, as well as the company 's succeed and is betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible to recruit in the lecture theatre best graduates, even before they get to the labour market and will be of interest in others.
Since the University of issued no lists of the success of their students, trying to firms find an exceptional talent in projects oriented practice and get them.
In the Braunschweig is trying to the automotive concern to get the talents of the next day.
A young lady from the personnel department gives a ballpoint pen, jellybeans and plates with logo.
He tells the budding young talent on programmes in practice, student jobs and suggests they travel to the concern.
Nico Selle from the Braunschweig cares about the project, together with the VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: `` students in contact with industry and gain experience. "
`` VW may at the same time to get to know the students, closer to meet interesting candidates and think about what should be as a partner. "
Such cooperation, according to the Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that they are so openly fighting for students.
`` It was more substantial professional project, "says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will probably even stronger.
In many sectors businesses are no longer able to choose their employees of long lines of candidates.
On the contrary, it must be to try and try to attract very highly skilled labour.
Graduates from engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Union of german engineers VDI remained in October 2004 40,000 engineering positions.
And it is forecast VDI so - called the lack of engineers will only increase.
After consulting firm of auditors and KPMG 's Roman Dykta hunting talent.
By demanding Recruiting - events, such as KPMG - Race, the nature of modern factory, the treasure, in which they must find a way to co - ordinates GPS.
The company plans to the next year, send as follows eight promising students in the US.
The participants may also examine branch KPMG and become familiar with the company.
In advance shall be decided in two selection rounds, who will participate.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates, it 's going to go to the US.
In the competition for High Potentials at universities will pay according to Dykty still harder laws.
`` We want to be with our Race differ from the other. "
`` A simple trip to the yacht was for us too little. "
It seems that scout Dykta is lucky.
`` We stayed in touch with all participants similar actions in the past year. "
`` Some will soon graduate and are planned for us to apply for a job, "he says.
In addition to the direct contacting on campus, in particular, small and medium sized firms themselves for labor markets.
`` We are trying to contact graduates to professional exhibitions. "
`` Such as Intersolar, "says Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of the manufacturer of the solar techniques Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs in Germany around 1,500 workers.
Stübe knows issues with young workers.
He is currently listed 35 positions on the web site of the company.
`` We are currently is a complex, fill vacancies. "
`` It 's worth a lot of time and money, "he says.
The other option is to contact via professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with different universities, e. g. the university in Freibergu.
`` Professors, they report that it is possible to do the practice or write thesis. "
Solar specialist hold no expensive publicity.
Instead of trying to the company to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy, and the light of communication.
`` The big groups that often can not offer, "says the personnel department Stübe.
Job search for a long time to make money, the main role.
A flexible working hours, childcare or good options procedure is another crucial factors.
Solarworld occupied in one study of the Institute of Great set it Work 55. place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up the annual list of the best german employers.
It also requires co - workers, as they are satisfied with her work, and the environment and monitor the framework conditions employees.
The head of the personnel department Stübe hopes that her position will bring points for candidates for the job.
`` I believe that interested parties shall inform, especially on the external evaluations potential employer, "he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the german Employer Branding Academy counsels companies, which you want to build a long - term strategy of the good reputation as an employer.
Instructs its customers, so that they were more autentičtí.
And, according to Mr. Krieglera that means, above all, internal measures.
`` The best way to raise the profile as an attractive employer is through its own staff, "he says.
Technically it is called the internal Employer Branding, i. e., the enforcement of the employer 's share of the market under their own staff.
`` Happy employees are the best envoys. "
When the company good care for their people, and they identify with the company, they themselves to advertise his employer among friends and acquaintances.
`` It 's a game with string, "says Kriegler.
Obama is stopping the new oil drilling
During the following years will be incurred prior to the US - the Federal Florida State in the Gulf of Mexico 's new oil wells.
The government in Washington, D. C., issued a corresponding to ban - and thus withdrawn definitively earlier plans.
Also, before the atlantic coast are not new drilling prohibited.
The Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar it said in the center.
The reason strict ban, who should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling tower `` Deepwater Horizon "in April.
Before this disaster, which was eleven employees life and led to the disaster of the environment in the US, signaled President Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and industry, its willingness to afford a new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocates of this trying to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date is clearly explained, who is responsible for a devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of the critics' s british energetic concern BP, which is confronted miliardovými applications.
The commission of enquiry, which was responsible for Obama, should produce results during December.
In October, the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar prohibition drilling, who paid from the explosion.
Subsequently made of various oil concerns the application of new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar catastrophe stricter controls and striktními security provisions.
Currently, a fundamental reform of the surveillance authority to the attention of many corruption charges.
At the same time, the Obama announced that he cancels lucrative options tax evasion for oil and gas concerns.
Industry now openly warned that stricter regulations substantially reduce the volume of excavated oil in the Gulf.
`` The government 's plans are the biggest impediment to the growth of gas and oil industry, "is the result of the exploration of the current in the field of advisory firm BDO - before the drilling in the center.
American Energy Alliance has yet to complain of uncertainty in the field: `` no one knows exactly what is the regulation of change. "
Investments in new mining projects, until the push - at the expense of growth.
The area Ogoni burned down
The water in the rivers is olejově brown, it smells like a gas station: billion gallons of oil escaped destroyed nature in the field of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People living on stealing, corruption, illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
`` Do not worry, "says journalists environmental activist: `` today, you will receive a lens enough of the oil mud."
37 - year - old Nigeriánec watched the attempt to take a picture of the boy, which is wading in the breast of water which surrounded by streaks: the scene is active in the aquatic luster with a rainbow almost as well.
That, under the surface of the swimming brown precipitate oil, can not be seen.
Earlier this gathering in containers enough garnel, says Esther Badom on the bank of the river Bodo - Jetty.
In the meantime, became slowly resulting water completely dead.
Five years ago, poured into a warm area of broken by the management of the large amounts of oil.
The fishermen from the nearby town Bodo must paddle at least six hours to get into the waters, where are the fish: the Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger River delta belongs to one of the worst of the infected area in the world.
On the way to the river mangrove - tree moors with a lot of the side of it is only a whole range of the trigger.
The engine on the boat cooks, instead of light brown water and who dipped his hand in the water, out of the fingers.
The roots of mangrovníků rises from the country as a black sticks liquorice, rarely occurring palm trees are letting their leaves hang sadly.
In vain we are looking for flocks of birds, which are commonly in damp areas exist: as soon as the engine die down on the boat, with no earlier in paradise, where it smells like a gas station, the eerie silence.
`` What is going on here, 's environmental management of the war, "says sadly celestine Akpobari: `` we live in a constant fear of health."
Compared with the war is justified.
The settlement Ogoni is a battlefield, where over the past few decades fights: more than 60 years ago came crowding the first conquerors from Europe, here in the 1980 's by the first resistance with later executed a writer Ken Saro - Wiwa, there had to concern Shell stop in 1993, their production, because it was too dangerous for employees.
Still, the company Ogoni shall not return: while the daily benefits from the entire area of the Delta a triple the size of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining drill and 7,000 kilometers of more than two million barrels of black gold, lies the oil fields in the field of Ogoni fallow, concern for the situation is very unstable.
Every few hundred yards rises from the water steel structure as grotesque statues: `` the Christmas trees ," so too softly as head of the drilling holes.
They are 50 years old, most to the rusty.
Any minute break such head vrtného opening, says Akpobari, and then comes a constant flow of oil into the water.
According to estimates of experts had turned into the ecosystem Delta in more than two billion litres in 50 years: each year a quantity of oil, which had turned into the sea from Alaska in the crash supertankeru `` Exxon Valdez "21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are differences, who is to continue to lasting ecological disaster responsible.
While the Shell indicates sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90% of pollution, this is the protectionists environment of the crackling heads wells and netěsných lines as the main cause.
Shell requires in Nigeria 's security regulations are much less than in the world, accused the trust in 2008 US - american researcher Richard Steiner: only the quantity of disorders lines is `` several times higher than elsewhere. "
In a place that looks like a distant deserted, oil grime workshop in the open air, will emerge from mangrovníků figures: they are completely naked and to the neck of oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are part of the leadership, partly arbitrarily scattered across the country, a fire: illegal small refinery.
Oil is in a barrel over the fire was heating for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First of leadership in záchytného pots gasoline, later dripping at the end of the leadership of kerosene and eventually NAFTA.
In this way it produces Michael and his four associates to four barrels a day after 300 litres: `` we are so 34.000 naira "- around $22.
The delta used a chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil State black Africa.
Nigeria 's own only one refinery.
Ridiculously low price of 40 cents euro per liter of naphtha may illegal producers not trump: because they have the raw materials for free.
Comes from the `` bunkerů "who are the lowermost limits on leadership everywhere in the field of Ogoni: according to experts in the whole field of Niger River delta is losing ground a day at least 16 million gallons of oil.
But only negligibly small part of temporarily stored raw materials are illegally improved: the largest share with organised criminal networks, to which they belong, and politicians and senior officials of the army to tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate whether caused disaster of the people and their actions or lax method of production, is considered activist Akpobari for purely academic.
`` If the thought of the oil company for intruders, and if so completely destroy the nature of the fishermen, then it would not sabotage, or theft and illegal refinery. "

To hell, warriors!
It 's a nightmare for the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome again the old border with its fighting epic of `` Walhalla Rising. "
In such an audience thought the danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when you are `` Walhalla Rising "?
Captured a Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be free from their torturers and on a large kills the almost supernatural powers with his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men 's viewers who seek a bloody events, because our hero helps ruthless methods of killing and their enemies tearing even the guts out of the stomach alive, as in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the one - eyed, as it is, in fact, called, during the whole movie says a word and other forms of utter no more than one or two sentences or be swayed by the painful cries of dying.
Otherwise, the silent and carousing in a horribly beautiful hilly landscape, Scotland, which offers the background to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal more adult enthusiasts movies with interest on existencializmus and very quiet what the camera.
It is good, when a film more target groups, it 's a shame, when are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, then what he made his wild and stylizovanou trilogy of drug dealers `` Pusher ," is considered the danish version of the director 's Quentin Tarantino, calmly, but from their works near either the mainstream of humor more or less the brutality of an audience.
Most of the artistic movies, is likely to be allowed to deter everywhere stříkajícím brain and guts.
Supporters of the action movie with unudí at the latest at the moment when the one - eyed issue of free to explain the reasons with a group of violent christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem, and will be hanging forever in the wind and the fog, than to get the crew to America and in there are silent.
There is therefore no wonder, you are in Germany, the `` Walhalla Rising "did not get to theaters and now has been issued only on DVD.
It 's a pity, mainly due to the beautiful záběrům, but also because of a distinctive façade,, broken blood, hiding exciting cinema, which brought a little attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or the exact, everything 's atmosphere, dream, who became a film.
And it is not for the viewer escape.
Refn him not a moment to release him and slowly choking its freezing pictures and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, in particular, but the ineffable hatred, which ones from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, which helps to one - eyed, retaining something like innocence, all of the others are driven by malice.
Most of all, one - eyed hero, whose motives are never explained that happens in time for your enemies and transitional allies warrior from hell, maybe the devil.
Acts out destruction, perhaps, but also the only for those wicked.
`` Walhalla Rising "is puzzling film that it is possible to hate and admire, for the angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
The mysterious earthworks
The Office for nuclear power, the IAEA has a new notification of covert nuclear program in Syria.
The country, but it expression - and do not allow control.
Around midnight of the 5 th of September 2007 attack at least four israeli combat airplanes F - 15 and mysterious square building in Syria.
Standing on the shore Euphratu; the greater the city 's distant 30 miles, and his name is Dair as - Saur.
In the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) appears her name, when it comes to the reactor, which supposedly put Syria, with the help of North Korea in this square schovaném in the valley, which turns from the current.
On the basis of a communication from the US - american foreign intelligence service, the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the village el - Kibar, suitable for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the 1950 's to all else.
The CIA has presented a video with nezaostřenými with satellite imagery.
By using the computer animation clarify, where the components of the reactor before the destruction of might be, it will be the scaled - down a copy of North Korea 's nuclear model of the Centre Yongbyon.
Moreover, there were submitted by the photographs, which showed the building up close, or even from the inside.
The reactor was shortly before running, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, he did not know much more than that, even with all the time has not increased.
The former US President George W. Bush recently in his memoirs, reported that the CIA was before the attack very sure that Syria is building in el - Kibar reactor, but in fact should not supporting documents that are in the country is `` active nuclear weapons program ."
Some of the rapporteur secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about `` the alleged reactor ," even if the presentation of the CIA as `` a convincing."
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how is sure that it has the reactor, said in the summer of high un diplomat, the IAEA has said, `` enough material to questions. "
The rubble of the supposedly `` unused military buildings "was the Syrians quickly while odklizená and also duly zarovnali terrain.
Yet it was able to find in June 2008 team the IAEA, under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el - Kibar traces of uranium, which was made people.
In addition, received the IAEA across a Member State satellite photos of commercial sellers of immediately after the attack, which should be better than you, which represented the CIA.
Unfortunately, these are not shown on the market, because it is exclusively bought unknown customer - maybe Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA can not confirm their identity.
Syria 's always claimed that had never had a secret nuclear program and did not oppose the reactor.
Uranium comes from the israeli weapons, expressed in Damascus.
But the myth of the IAEA after an analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite footage.
In addition, the disabled revizorům the second inspection in el - Kibar and access to the ruins of rozbombardované buildings.
But also Israel obstinately silent.
`` We will never comment, "said recently official position at the time of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case, so it goes without result from June 2008 and `` grows into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the Office, "as he admitted a western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna - it is, after all, a serious breach of contract for the abolition of nuclear weapons, to which the IAEA monitoring.
The IAEA is considered to be the key to take forward in the next three facilities to be `` in working together "with the alleged reactor - and, unlike him still exist.
Examiners, so far, or for which the device is not what they are function or why they are suspicious.
According to the information newspapers Sueddeutsche Zeitung is the IAEA internally referred to as Marj as - Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again in the nearby towns.
An independent of the Institute for Science and the International Security in Washington (CORA) identified these objects and found to 46 complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
Perhaps it is inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason refuses to Syria IAEA access to the three points.
In Vienna was that the Syrians afraid of the so - called `` fishing expedition - that would be the IAEA in advance seconded by the US, to find a military base.
The nuclear detectives were notified of the device intelligence service in the US.
The IAEA 's documents, and also the satellite imagery, between these three points and a square of Euphratu beamed material here and there.
In Vienna said a western diplomat, that at least one furnished should be `` in connection with the production of fuel ."
But there are `` no evidence of senzibilních activities, "that is, of uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of the reactor is driven by a while, which is enriched uranium.
But where the uranium is and where it later to secede plutonium for a bomb, central to these questions, there are only likely estimates.
It is also known whether the debris, which could hide important evidence, are kept in these three areas.
Like disappeared from the face of the earth hundreds of the costs of freight wagons, nobody seems to have the information, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometers from el - Kibar remote and, on the other hand, Euphratu lying salt mine al - Tibni, which left Syria check in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for the radioactive waste, considers the IAEA as unlikely.
In the past, the IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in connection with the reactor in one of the satellite imagery for the prestigious journal of Jane 's Intelligence Review.
The images but shows that, after the IAEA requested, Syria on all suspects places earthworks and eliminate large containers.
It could be a coincidence, but it did not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, this is a diplomatic circles, the IAEA spent many months the formation of a plan for the revizory, which would allow Syria retain any military secrets - only the strain shows how large is interest revizorů.
In the meantime, Damascus, refused to this proposal, too.
If a year ago, the comforted western diplomats in Vienna, that 's the reactor, broken, and, therefore, the thing does not burn, this is already a few months, US ambassador Glyn Davies on the so - called `` special inspections, which is one of the most brutal funds, which has the Vienna nuclear authority to implement controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, which would have to propose inspections, already spoke of `` options, which, in the future, but so far, "i tend to hesitate.
This is a big risk: on the one hand, the need for a majority in the Council, the IAEA and many of the 35 countries has certainly interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat notes: `` what happens when, in the end, they will find nothing? "
Love in times of war
Since the Angelina Jolie began in the summer of work on still nameless overhead prvotině, there is a problem.
She wrote the script, it is a love story of the women from Bosnia and men from Serbia.
Many more he did not yet know - but it causes anxiety.
It was talking about the woman, which is a Muslim, love during the war in Yugoslavia in Serbia of a man who raped her.
The Bosnian women 's clubs immediately protest, so the hastily scheduled production shifted from Sarajevo in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film in Hungary dotočil and is in the post - production, in bosensku, but still protesting.
Bakir Hasecic of women 's organisations VICTIMS wrote over un - organization, with the help of refugees UNHCR Jolie and demanded a meeting with an actress, informed now bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the UN Ambassador - organization, with the help of refugees.
It is not just a diplomatic - offered women already weeks before the meeting in Hungary, but rejected.
The meeting shall be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the campsite, where the znásilňovalo, love stories did not take place and the position of the Jolie to victims betrays enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended un - organization, with the help of refugees to Jolie dismissed as the ambassador, inform the Guardian.
The scenes exactly wrote Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of culture, which was given to read the script, permitted in smaller expended in Sarajevo shooting - it is not entirely clear why then Jolie yet to come.
The author of the young stresses that, in his film tracking no political intentions that, with an effort to address the conflict in Yugoslavia, that he wants to show the horrible consequences of war and all interested parties to give room.
Whereas the content remains uncertain.
On the Internet is still a version of the film, which is a very different: the lovers was known before the start of the war, and again they meet, when she is like the Bosnian Muslim zavlečená in Serbia 's camp, where he served as guardian.
Which really is very different than `` rape victim 's in his tormentor ."
The fact that the film Jolie really beginning to already before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that it is under pressure, `` that 's not fair and is based on incorrect information. "
Now she can get it 's hekeři from Hollywood: that published illegally on the Internet her scenario, how many times did.
Nothing but away
This evening, it is once again good for the Irish.

100 000 Irish leaves in the foreseeable future, the country, scientific experts predict the Institute for Economic and Social Affairs ESRI in Dublin.
They even by 2015 with 200 000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4,5 million people, it is essential loss.
If the forecasts confirm, there will be a similar expatriate wave, what protrpělo Ireland in the 1980 's.
After a decade of the rise, which brought the Irish great wealth is now the widening again unhappiness.
The economic crisis znejišťuje primarily young, well - educated Irish who have experienced only rise.
The loss of jobs, and social progress seemed in these years boom of the absurd.
The need for each, money has been lost.

`` No emotions, "says and drank all the beer.
`` Good - bye, it sounds alarmingly. "
`` Call it a party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games. "
The normal practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is rising, as well as support for the private business.
Crime is greater than the concerns of unemployment.
And Brazil, many of the regions considers it 's more powerful than the United States.
There are some of the results of the survey Latinobarómetro, which took place in the 18 countries, and walked exclusively in the Economist magazine.
Since the survey held since 1995, may i to follow the change in attitude across the entire area.
In this year 's survey, which took place in September and at the beginning of October, dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America is fairly cheerful mood.
The second is to improve the stability of the attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific in South America has significantly increased (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where is from the year 2002 economic growth on average 6% per year, increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Increased also in Mexico, where the economics of recovering from a deep decline in production in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populated areas, are convinced democrats, which is the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the entire area gives satisfaction with it, as in their country of democracy works in practice, this is the same number as the last year, but compared to 2001, when it was about 25%, this is a big increase (Figure 3).
About $34% said that they have confidence in the Vedek in his country and 45% of trust in the government, once again, this is the same number as in the past year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago has undermined democracy in Latin America, the economic crisis.
The aid during the global financial crisis is likely to be on the grounds that many latin american countries suffered only a recession, and with a strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger network of social security would help protect the poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week announced that the ratio of latinoameričanů living in poverty has increased in 2009 only slightly and in this year again fell to 32%).
But the mood is amended in a broad range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Strong economic performance Brazil and its popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where there was a recession worse and worse, the violent crime.
Only the second time since began to carry out surveys, see more of the respondents across Latin America as the most important issue crime, rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Around 31% says that either they or their close relatives became in the last year of the victims of crime, but it 's decline in comparison with the 38% from last year, and it is also the lowest number since 1995.
Masivnější economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private business, and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the entire area, says that private enterprise is necessary for the development of, this percentage has increased from 56% from the year 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% agrees that a market economy is only system that will allow the development of their country, this percentage has increased from 47% from last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela is of the same opinion (and 80% there supports private enterprise), even though their leftist president Hugo Chávez expropriating many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as mentioned 19% of respondents (as opposed to 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year)
However, the United States are considered the most powerful country respondents in Mexico, and in a large part of the Central America, Venezuela, Ecuador, success in the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected that will be the general election in Haiti, on 28 November perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders, who are trying to help the country affected, to be afraid.
Elections were filling the ballot box and repeating the vote, the ballot rozmetané after channels, broken electoral room and intimidation.
The conference room open for hours late.
Many Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, wandering around, trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them are finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few anticipated předběžců shouted, it 's fraud and called for the abolition of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet, Edmond mulet, a senior officer of the UN in Haiti, said that the ``, in many ways, it was a pretty good choice. "
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community carefully, they said, `` do not believe that these inconsistencies, whether they were any serious, not necessarily have to cancel the ."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are committed to René Prévalovi, the departing unpopular President and its candidate, Jude Célestinovi, has to make a preliminary results of 7 December.
The decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All of the electoral hope is not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rap and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from its original appeals to the vote was declared invalid.
But the problem can occur if Mr. Célestin, which has little or negligible support among voters, will be marked Electoral Commission for reached a decisive battle.
Because of the delirious cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people, who after the earthquake still living in tents, there were fears that the electoral participation is low.
In the end, many Haitians to vote, but because of dezorganizace them in that it was prevented.
Roughly 250 grand identity documents, which are necessary for the vote, remained shortly before the election undistributed.
There 's too much at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians make themselves.
He tiptoed to the center
In the weeks, when suddenly widowed, benefiting Cristina Ferndndez, Argentina 's president, from the public sympathy, when its popularity increased from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since it was in the year 2007 elected.
Yet the reversal of this success in the successful campaign for a second term in elections in the next year may depend on the mourners Mrs Fernándezová relinquishes nekompromisnosti my late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstora Kirchner.
And on these characteristics are all based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and, after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of budgeting, which downgrading tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first pair spend more revenue at will.
The government of Mrs Fernándezové lost in the last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and was further destabilised in the death of Mr. Kirchner on a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist join Mrs. Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which were hitting and blaming the governments of corruption), Congress could not approve of the budget for year 2011.
`` I am not going to argue, "said the President.
The budget for the year 2010 will now also apply to the next year, while the president will have more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating excessively: this year 's likely growth to 9%.
Oficiální inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speaks of heading, which are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, which took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, established a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than on controlling inflation.
Has refused to deal with the IMF, with the private sector and cleaned INDEC, statistical agency, which has acceded to monitor the inflationary official statistics.
It may now, the president of the Fernándezová moderated this policy?
Called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to in the next year to limit the wage growth on 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth in world prices for exports argentine agricultural products.
But inflation impeding growth, based on a big depreciation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs. President Fernándezová suggests that he wants to restore Argentina 's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with the bondholders, who had refused to debt restructuring, which Argentina in 2001 did not pay.
Now faces Mrs. President Fernándezová agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which he owes roughly 6,7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact was on the IMF surveillance, as usual.
But last month Amado they will, the Minister of the economy, announced that the Fund will provide the `` technical assistance "that was designed a new national spotřebitelsko - price index, which will remind the introduction to cleaning INDEC.
It is still unclear whether, Madam President Fernándezová will want to remain in politics, after the end of his term of office, when my husband 's at her side.
If you want to stay, needs to gain the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the return of Argentines from the summer vacation, which are in March, it will be a wave of sympathy decline.
If you want to win the next election, it will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to quietly to forgo many views that her husband in politics.
Half an encouragement to China.
Taiwanese voters are closer closer to the mainland.
What do you think about his big brother Taiwan across the sea?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November mayor and the Council of the town in five urban circuits, which may be considered a broader evaluation of the president, Ma - Ying jeou.
Mr. President Ma itself is a member of the feelings which to prevail, and they have a strong support in business relations, including the agreement on the part of the free market, in the largest settlement with China from 1949.
Mr. President has passed the test, but only just.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) failed to win, three of the five offices of the mayor, failed to win a majority of the votes.
In addition to the democratic Progressive Party, democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is a greater willingness of Taiwan 's gained almost 50% of the votes against 45% of the KMT.
As if it were a presidential election, should President Ma problem.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of the votes of his party, reduced by approximately 8%.
For the first time, was the DPP, together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election took place as most of Taiwan 's elections, which include the noisy electoral trucks and mass gatherings with the flags, dimly laboring girls.
Part of it was even mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son Lien Chan, an honorary chairman of the KMT was stumping for candidates KMT on the eve of the election.
The man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien purely over his face, hurt him and killed the viewer.
It was addressed to the bizarrely, whether he admitted grudgingly intends to hurt Mr Liena or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing - - Wen, an leading the DPP, says that the shooting had an impact on the elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads to voters in the direction of the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how remained in the background, the question of the land.
Instead, the candidates seams about plans to state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan 's usually used their de facto independence and hates military threats of China.
The KMT has therefore tend to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP dropped also from vzbuzování anti - chinese positions.
It 's response to the fact and awareness that China' s trade is essential for economic survival Taiwan.
Mr. President Ma for his party, confirmed that China 's policy is for the majority of Taiwan' s acceptable.
From the government in Beijing, it can be expected that will continue in the commercial bribes, together with their strategies to Taiwan lured back to the herd.
China wasted no time in sending negotiators to Taipeje, to get the summit of investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It would be better to wait until after the presidential election in 2012.
The party of the DPP in any case, found itself.
Two years ago, it was on the wrong level: its former leader, Chen Shui - bian, were sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000 - 08 was a troublemaker and the proponents of clear independence.
But, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai has developed a new generation, which is a moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was provolávána as the DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng - changem, which he was under Mr. Chen.
Their party now does all showed that may also cooperate with the Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations may take place without previous conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwan 's public, that her party is a `` credible alternative, "Mr Ma jumped to access to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the candidates DPP would be better off if insisted that Taiwan 's individual countries.
Even ordered Mr. Su, pragmatikovi to run for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr. Chen will be the DPP to fight for the choice between the potential candidates.
The KMT is authorized to search for their own people.
Evaluation of Mr Ma were bad, and despite breakneck economic growth; candidates KMT with him to go to the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the growing divide between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says that přeorganizuje his cabinet, as well as the local branch.
Strongly advocated by proposals to support the Taiwan for a rapprochement are limited.
At the same time as the most of Taiwan 's citizens of the economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chianga, prominent publicist, `` point from which there is no return, has passed. "

Microbes with resistance to arsenic increases the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of the strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of their nutrients, extends the scope for the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth, and argue that this is a sign that life has options outside the main elements which have been considered and basic.
`` This organism is twofold ability. "
`` Can growth, either because of phosphorus or arsenic. "
`` This is a very special, but it 's not evidence that this is a form of a truly' extraterrestrial life ', "commented this fact Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co - author of the report, which have appeared on Thursday in online magazine Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of the main elements of the six - carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria, discovered in mono Lake in California, they are able to continue to growth, after the for arsenic will replace the phosphorus.
`` You wonder what it is still possible, "said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co - author of messages.
This finding is significant for searching for life outside the country, because researchers must be able to detect life and you know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this innovation, published in order to about her discussed, which betrayed the details of the discovery, aroused widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It 's not so.
The discovery of the `` shows that other planetary organisms may be able to take advantage of the other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements, which are considered 'standard', may not be for life so absolutely necessary, "said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, the Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
`` This work is unusual, because it shows the replacement of one element of other in basic biochemistry and biochemical patterns, "he added Cockell.
It was not accidental discovery.
Felisa wolf - Simon from Astrobiologického Institute for NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake, because it shows a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, she thought, therefore, that the microbe, which is exposed to the two elements, may be able to replace the one behind the other.
`` Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to the phosphorus. "
`` The result is that the organisms can be difficult to these elements separated. "
`` However, arsenic is so different that, as well as Phosphorus does not work if they get into the body, starts to work in the biochemical processes, "explained Anbar.
Scientists collected bacteria known as GFAJ - 1 and issue is the growing arsenic concentration, which are bacteria able to adapt and growth.
Microbes are better when the phosphorus, but, given that can survive also with refund arzenem, increases the possibility that a form of life, which makes use of arsenic, it may occur naturally, either elsewhere on the ground, or on another planet or months, where is arsenic more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, he said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by the phosphorus, it is not new, but never found an example, on which this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on the ground, she said, and so scientists have speculated that it may benefit from the previous life forms.
`` This suggests that could be different ways to create life, not only in a manner, which was created in the early period of the country, "said Foster, which was part of the research team wolf - Simon.
Research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health

Technological toys, to keep your budget for gifts in balance
The head of the candidate of this year 's greatest toy iPad, followed by videoherní system. in both cases, but it is a significant interference in the budget for the gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPadu you can buy five BMX bicycles for 99 bucks and one game Kinect stands as much as 10 bead švihadel or approximately 48 cups Play - Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in the balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailer - Wal - Mart, Toys' R 'Us and BJ' s wholesale bank Club - and watched the toys you can buy for less than $80.
It was at once clear that works Moore 's law; this year' s technological toys are far more energy, and at the same price, if not slightly lower, compared with previous years.
While there was a relatively less new toys with affiliated sites, two of the most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
The increasing number of toys with the knoflíkovými batteries, as well as toys with batteries nabíjecími.
Here are some of the recommendations.
(All prices are of Toys' R 'Us, except in cases which are marked by otherwise.)
Sing - and - Ma - jigs (Mattel, 13, from $3 years) are stuffed animals, which they sing, when i press tummy.
In one pressing issue a pet tone and the second scan would create a song.
If you buy more than one, will be singing together and harmoniously.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can not stop.
The best option in a combination of a song and dance is the Star Mickey (Fisher - Price, 60, from $2 years)
Last year, i am Elmo Live Technology lent 14 a one - inch animatrickou doll, who can play a game Simon says, and the moon walks, thanks to its innovative hinged leg with the locking wheel.
Children tested toy Mickey dance instructor, although their parents complain about the lack of the volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980 s, you may recall the Alphie, one of the first computer training of toys.

And, finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five blocks, which are not more than a box of matches, each of them has led display.
The aim is to create the words of placing the dice in a row, before the end of time; it is great for competition in the form of words.
Still more toys has at least some kind of online communication.
In the highest degree in the toy stores two toys Webkinz and Club ."

It is also very persistent.
This was able to fall in the kitchen table and even to spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of a police checks in China
As the city military instructor, went Tang Shenbin of the square, strictly controlled his orders, and giving orders in an undertone with military authority.
He wanted to the female member of - China 's sturdy vymahatelky urban right, the dreaded and despised for their crackdowns and taste for violence - give the impression of a group of the crowd.
`` Stand up straight! "
`` Hurry! "
Show them whispering quietly, `` how they look pretty girls! "
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers were put to attention.
Four pairs of black boots are listed as a ruler.
Four headgear perfectly sitting on her hair, which are perfectly tied a blue and white ribbons.
`` I personally feel that they are, on average, "said disdainfully Mr Tang.
`` Models are nice. "
More than one government tried to revive the image of the city guards in China.
One city ordered to new recruits had higher education.
'S Guangdong province changed Sedo - green uniforms on supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China to replace the stare for a strong armament: in 2009 was in one report noted that 50 officers were surrounded by adamantly cart lunches and stared at the owner of the watch, when the door - to - door salespeople after half an hour, pack up and leave.
Xindu, urban district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, for the image of the chosen operation.
Since 2003 district complete its the municipal police about 13 women who were selected specifically, according to his appearance of a young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the gross page police softer, too, a woman 's side.
Unfortunately, the very Natasa Solak should trouble to get into the secret of China 's urban groups.
They argued critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, is the police only allowed to promote the bill, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the chinese media commonly recognised different reality.
In January 2008 police inspectors from the Hubei Province was clubbed to death after used his cell phone to work, as they do in surgery in the matter of protest against the landfill.
In the last year was training policemen in Beijing, manual to this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. in a manual was, inter alia, a description of how effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year 's got a glimpse of melons in Shanghai into a fight with five police officers and suffered injury to the left of the brain.
One video game of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows the policemen, as the attack on the street vendor.
`` Chengguan scared the hell out of the government, "China Daily, national issue, screaming in the last year, after a further discussion about tactics.
On paper was `` very thoroughly unclog. "
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised in October interest in the eight new women 's officers, an editorial the Beijing Evening News addressing the question of whether women have a real obligations or are only one.
The answer seems to be of both.
District demanded a female candidates in the age of 18 to 22 years with a good character and `` five features in the right proportion. "
Adeptky should have a height greater than the average - more than 1,6 feet.
Pasture at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials argue that the work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
`` Their image is the most important thing, "said one policeman on an unnamed Rednet. com, as if the government 's website.
`` Candidate must demonstrate external quality, then the other, among them, height, weight, features, etc. "
Then comes at a series of nature and `` internal quality ."
Women are like flower vases, he said, and added, `` besides, that will be the vases, will also have other responsibilities. "
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the leadership of the county - town, with this description of power does not agree.
But pointed out that the requirements of the portrait are in China 's normal also for other positions, and it in both sexes.
As well as the request for a balanced features.
Which means that the question of good appearance is between the Chinese the subject of discussions.
The disabled or maimed will not apply.
`` Can not allow us to serve the lame or hunchback man, "said Mr. Zheng.
`` His image would not be good. "
Liu Yi, which holds a watch on the square Baoguang in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces like apples and gently shaped mouth.
Consider that the emphasis on her appearance might have sexist character, she said.
`` Do you think that in this uniform look sexy? "asked with an ironical eyes.
Its co - with the dimples, 21 - year old Xu Yang, says, `` our task is to represent the image of the town. "
Do not object to his limited power of, say, because of their career ambitions are greater than the only skeer traders in the streets, where they can carry out his activity.
Each morning 's group against more than ten trhovcům, who are running on foot or on the wheels, and they are trying to sell what most dumplings and dishes tofu before they are driven.
`` Wang, you must leave. "
`` You already said it very much! "said Miss Xu, when he began on the run, and at the time he abandoned his wheel of the cart noodle.
The police describe their obligations as more than a monotonous work.
`` Every day, it is, in fact, "said the Huang Jing, 20, which is studying in his spare time.
`` The big routine. "
One reason is that the female MP do not have powers as their male counterparts, in order to seize the seller of the goods.
They may only threaten the fact that the report their relationship manager.
The trend is then to protect them from the public expressions of hostility against the official line, which are common in the whole of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled, after the spread of false rumours that the cops killed the seller.
More than ten police officers or policemen were injured in the hours; 14 government vehicle was reversed or ignited.
Xindu yet such violence escaped.
But it can be guaranteed only barely.
Only two blocks from the quiet square Baoguang, where that morning should watch a state trooper, on the corner of the street pool of more than 50 people.
Police officers confiscated the motorcycle, which is fixed on the sidewalk place inside the shop, as required by law.
The owner of the wheels could cry as he wanted to.
15 a distance from the police, masquerading angrily, with his elbows against vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
If Xuedong, 40, the coordinator přičleněný to a man 's group, he stayed behind his badge, turned to hide his name.
As well as the female MP, the coordinators are men over 40 years, which already have only an ancillary role.
On the contrary, they are not learned in the maintenance and uhlazování image.
`` Sometimes we are fighting verbally. "
`` We are fighting sometimes physically, "said Mr. if the matter - of - factly.
`` It 's usually the public, which starts it. "
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensigna
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared of Senator John Ensigna of criminal charge, which covered his affair with a former advisor to the campaign and its efforts to ensure the lobby, announced in the center of the senator lawyers.
The decision to end the most serious legal threat, which Mr. does, Nevada Republican, faced and which were, until the scandal, is considered a potential republican candidate for president for the year 2012. the Yukos affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
The Office of Mr Ensigna said that he was a decision that followed almost after the investigation, `` certainly not, of course, ."
Sen could still face a disciplinary proceedings in the Senate Ethics Committee.
Lawyers Mr Ensigna, they said, `` the Justice Department has informed us that Senator does will no longer be the objective of the investigation and that it is not in the plan to raise additional charges against him in this matter. "
The Justice Department to the case has declined to comment.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there are compelling evidence that Mr. does not prepared for breach of the prohibition of federal lobbying.
The talks, e - mails, and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. does not helped Douglasu Hamptonovi, one of his assistants, to ensure a lucrative lobbies, which should lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator 's relationship with her.
Mrs. keeping your secrets once worked as cashier in the campaign Ensigna.
Mr. does not contacted the range of political supporters, to find work for Mr. Hampton and promote their views, after Mr. Hampton work to lobbying, much of the documents and the talks.
Since he was until recently, Mr. Hampton assistant Ensigna, was of the law of lobbying of his former employer or Chamber of the year.
Experts on the ethics of claims that unusual settlement of Mr Ensigna and Mr. Hampton, who were in front of the affair of friends, appeared in breach of the prohibition on lobbying.
From the evidence, which were published a `` it became clear that it is a clear case of violation of the law, "said Stanley Brand, Washington lawyer who specializes in defense of the clients who are investigating the Government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Case Senator Ensigna, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing on Ethics said that the Ministry 's cautious, concerning policy actions, after a large number of failures, including the decision of the last year, suspend proceedings against the former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of misconduct prosecution.
The federal prosecutors `` clearly hid weapons, "said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Organization for the citizens of responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D. C., (Citizens for social and Ethics in Washington), the law firm group, which was lodged in the case of several complaints against Mr. Ensignovi.
`` It shows, in fact, a senior government officials have laws apply, "she added.
Paul Coggins, the lawyer Mr Ensigna, in an interview told him on Monday, called the State Department of Justice and subsequently, then the next day, and told him that the Ministry of found against his client no charges.
Defense team of Mr Ensigna cooperates with the applicants in an effort to convince them that Senator, as his office repeated in Wednesday 's statement, `` acted in accordance with the law. "
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments that turned over to national representatives.
`` I am not comfortable about the details of my discussions with the Ministry of justice, in addition to think that made the right decision, "he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided on the closing of the investigation with a separate complaint, in which the ethical group filed charges that the payment of parents Ensigna hamptons of 96,000 $violated federal election law.
The election, the Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to show that the money meant nothing more than a gift.
One company, for which Mr. does not help Mr. Hamptonovi lobbying to find work, the company was NV Energy, the main Nevada, the company that long Senator support.
One e - mail of December 2008 demonstrated that, after began to Mr. Hampton in the company to act as a `` lobbyist, chief of staff Mr Ensigna - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hamptonem and said, that `` "'to the Ministry of Interior discussed on the subject.
Mr. does not also participated in the lunch with Mr. Hamptonem and other nevadským client, Allegiant Air Transport Minister and called on to arrange another meeting on behalf of the airline, after the hire Mr. Hampton lobbying to work.
When the last year, for the first time, a report on the affair, Mr. does not apologize to their voters and resigned as the fourth republican leaders in the Senate.
After the director of stagnation of Mr. does two weeks ago told reporters that is planned to participate in the third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr. does it is no longer the aim of criminal investigation his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said that Senator hopes that the Ethics Committee will quickly followed by the Ministry of Justice and the end of the investigation.
`` He does not look forward to continue its efforts in the name of Nevada, people, "she said.
The challenge of Cheshire turns on Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom half a dozen.
The minute by minute sending a message of horrendous testimony over Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that, more than 140 000 reports on Twitter addressed the rape and přivazováním children to their beds in the house, which was kindled.
Thursday held the trial Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted for the killing of three of the citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and should be held official end with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the panel voted.
But lawyers Mr. Reuben Hayes already filed an appeal to the Court of the arguments, which would court is likely to be employed years.
One of the nejprovokativnějších is that the intensive reporting process - including the widespread use of the main Twitter reporters - create `` a circus atmosphere "and this enhanced, the immediate penetration of information with pobuřujícími details then adopted a jury in a decision within the meaning of influencing public opinion.
This claim could make the judge to address the question of whether with the emergence of new technologies that also new rules in the courtroom.
`` As i have seen in this trial, i think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of due process for individuals, "said Thomas J. Ullmann, the attorney, Mr. Reuben Hayes.
The judge of the process Jon C. Blue State Supreme Court brief rejected allegations concerning the yield of the last week, and with it, that the media were `` carefully controlled, "and that there is no evidence to suggest that the jury has acted under the influence of the public.
But it is probably the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts recognized that the news notoriously famous cases may cause questions about justice process.
In the regulation of 1966 the United States Supreme Court annulled condemnation though chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when, in its decision, he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, is in the process of the media was a `` party atmosphere ."
Some are convinced that this offence has been an inspiration tv show, and the film `` fugitive ."
Some of the lawyers say that appeals courts, which was reviewed Hayesův judgment about half a century later, could be surprised argument that might be necessary new rules that determine the method of communication in the direction of the court, which was, in the case of Dr. Sheppard inconceivable.
`` There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media "in the cases, said John J. Donohue III, Professor of Law, Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut, and wrote a report, which said it was exercised at any time.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be pleased with the idea that the restrictions on the communication from the court may make a fairer process.
Case Twitter is only one of the many outlined lawyers Mr. Reuben Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to comply with the judgment.
Advocates also, for example, says that, in the case of Mr. Reuben Hayes may go about bias, when the judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jurors them in the selection of the jury will show a photograph of an awe - inspiring.
Some of the judges said that they were aghast photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke - Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates argue that also refuse to abandon constitutionality of the death penalty, and argue that the judge incorrectly called the judge, who was critical of the representatives of the state, and that a decision incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and routed the jury to this weekend thinking.
The judges were separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
In opposition against the verdict made last month, that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut, and has been discussed during the election campaign candidate for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly flames of emotion in this case.
`` Day of media, the cameras and reporters before the court wrote, `` the lawyer, `` there was something here in New Haven is yet to see, and it 's also possible on national, a rarity. "
Their focus on the effect of Twitter 's controversial.
In his talks some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous, than the reports referred to later and, from their point of view, should the police to manage the scope of the other processes.
But some lawyers demanded appeals courts with the arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Lawyers, Mr. Reuben Hayes, seek to this right.
In its archives referred to the Supreme Court decision in 1966, in case the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process, and to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
`` This case, "wrote, `` a case Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21 st century."
May politeness to overcome the gap?
After the campaign, which was a remarkable his hurtful and negativismem, this week in Washington, D. C., a small number of politeness.
It 's the first swallow real cooperation two political parties or only iluzivní moment before the rapid return to the party' s struggle in the capital city?
Tuesday 's negotiations President Obama' s and the parliamentary leaders brought about any fundamental discoveries on the crucial issues, which must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a lively discussion about the opinion of the division of the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode Party 's competition.
Wednesday public meetings of the President 's deficit, the Commission was also a civilized, and despite the political differences between members of the remain.
It seems that it is clear that close cooperation for several months has built up mutual respect, which exceeds the ideological divide that members still divides.
And it is very difficult to argue that started a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in the test period - sondují each other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience vis - à - vis the renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also Tuesday 's negotiations and his later evaluation of the participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep for it to be proposed by the rapid change of circumstances, which are the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, spending, health care or rights, the two parties are miles away.
However, November elections to Washington at least quickly.
`` The question is not whether changed regulatory issues, "said Pete Wehner, Bush 's administrator, now in the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
`` You are after the election, the inevitable.
The choice of the party had roused emotions and then fell silent.
It is good. "
In a number of issues, in particular those to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats little chance of finding a solution.
Bush 's tax cuts at the end of the year, has expired, and it is not considered to be favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, and that permanently or temporarily.
Just as likely to compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans can not look at how supported the tax cuts for the rich, while the unemployed refuse to support in unemployment.
After Tuesday 's negotiations in the White House is to see greater optimism about possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening of the Treaty.
But William Galston from the Brookings Institution points out that a successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two of political parties, when the 112. Congress convened in January.
Rather, it is likely the period of discord, or even the inevitable, he said.
`` After they do things that have to do with the psychology in the short term returns to one of confrontation, "he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely expanded - the courtesy will lead is real cooperation.
`` I am looking at all events, between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main event occur in 2012, "he said.
The reasons, to a large extent linked to the establishment of the new republican majority in the White House and voters tea parties, who helped create.
Republican leaders now stands before the dangers of exaggeration, knowing that they must act according to their promises, and must reduce spending, governments and cancel the new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the early 'responses to the recommendations of the deficit, which include a reform of the tax code and an increase in some taxes, raising the retirement age and a reduction of the expenditure.
The Joint Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, D. C., and they have, in my opinion, pressure questions of the deficit to public scheme in ways that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in 18 member of the Commission to its plan to introduce a formal recommendations and fought, therefore, that is to this number as possible.
The largest opposition between elected officials in the jury, who claim that, in the case of the financial issues have, at least today, the foundations of a small or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battle between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first starts next year, in the form of a party of conflict, when the Republicans invited Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, when a period, the greater the party 's cooperation.
What will shift?
Public opinion.
There are plenty of evidence that, despite stranickosti in the last election, most Americans wants to continue to see the two parties that working together.
If you could be directed to a stalemate, as it was in the year 1995, then, both parties will be very carefully monitor the public reaction.
Anyone would risk reduction of votes, is likely to change course and the search for a compromise.
It may be optimistic view of things.
Partisanship and the guidelines are more today than it was in the mid - 1990 's, it appears that a greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans, as was the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides of the sees the year 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, this week, would prefer many Americans.
It will be a state, but many efforts on both sides to find common bases on issues, which is still divided.
Vyzrazený american document describing Moscow as a haven for corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the `` kleptocracies ," and it continues parts of bribes and bribes protection, which is the way to Kremlinu, headed for the American Embassy in Russia in the records of February.
The police, and the Federal security service, to a large extent, holds a wings, which help to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
Collect the money not only from the legal transactions, but also from organised crime groups.
Each of the bureaucracy - which, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called `` vertikála office "- take their, when the money will begin to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington, D. C., under the name of ambasadora John Beyrleho, was in the middle of the public through WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the resources, whose name was redigována.
The record was written in a time when he was the mayor Yuri Luzhkov still and accuses him of large a share of the corruption.
It has been revoked in October, president of Dvořák Medvedevem, but since then we can see only minimal changes in the purification.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, which owns a prominent construction company, for many years consistently denied charges of corruption, and he won several actions on false charges for such allegations.
In September, he said to Russia 's tv station, when he was asked by the testimony of corruption: `` it' s crazy, if it 's dirty, it' s shit. "
The Russians with absolute conviction, he believes that if their company of a corrupt, it turned out that the vote.
It is, of course, an unusual meeting with such details vyřčenými in such a manner, and that in ambasádní report, and it is also an unprecedented thing that would do so diplomats from foreign countries.
`` The government of the town of Moscow and its links with the criminal element some led to called her 'dysfunctional,' and confirmed that the government is more like kleptocracies than as a government, "says the report.
`` Criminal elements of the pleasure of the so - called 'krysha' (the term of the world and the mafia, literally means' top 'or protection), provided by the police, of the Federal Security Service, of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the state' s attorney, as well as everywhere in the city of Moscow 's government bureaucracies.
`` Analysts identified and třístupňovou structure in criminal world Moscow. "
`` Luzhkov 's at the top. "
`` The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and militias are on the second stage. "
`` And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals, and corrupt inspectors. "
`` It is ineffective system, in which the criminal groups, filling the gaps in some areas, as the city of some services provided. "
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest companies, and the police focuses on smaller enterprises.
One source said, `` the owners of the business in Moscow recognize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Internal Affairs (rather than from organised crime groups), because they do not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also are protected by the law. "
`` Therefore, already protection from criminal gangs is not so in the course of. "
Recording says that, while the selection of the money is a complex, protecting itself may already have trouble; and those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who are not fast enough, with their business under various pretexts closing.
Medvedev several times, he spoke of fighting corruption, but he admitted that he did not only a little progress.
Ambasádní report on the last cases, probably bulging with cash, to the Kremlinu.
`` In its fight against corruption must be Medvedev rely on the bureaucrats, "he said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow 's research team of Indem.
`` But it is part of the bureaucracy. "
`` Is not part of the political class, because Russia 's political class already exist. "
Without the politicians, without the opposition, without the distribution of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide is corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is one of the 154. place in a recent survey about global perception of corruption, a non - governmental organisation Transparency International (countries are sorted from at least after the most corrupt).
The discovery of the reports of the U. S. embassy in Moscow in the late evening, i will not give rise to the russian government enthusiasm, though only to the extent that, in Moscow 's shortcomings may be charged with Luzhkov, it may be for the Kremlin to argue that the solution to the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry King told Putin that documents which WikiLeaks publicized could be counterfeit and responded angrily to a statement that it american diplomats called Batman and Robin Medvedeva.
`` The truth of the matter is that it 's about our mutual synergies, which is an important factor in the domestic policy in this country, "he said.
`` But to be honest, we did not think it will be carried out in such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical. "
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to come to terms with the past
In the dimly lit room with a concrete zašpiněnými and oloupanými walls reminded the headmaster Anlong Veng High School of a man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge the fluid.
`` We all love the Mocha. "
`` It was a good leader and took care of his people, "said Sreng KOR, Ma, 42.
Known as `` the butcher "for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge, remains commander in this remote estate Khmer Rouge in the northwest Cambodia popular, where he built the hospital, bridges, and other infrastructure, and where is still alive thousands of former soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge gave governments, she 's busted long - lasting loyalty also in Anlong Vengu.
In April were victims at the Forum truth and reconciliation allowed to publicly to confront with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government has provided textbooks, which for the first time children to explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, raise together the UN, and Cambodia 's Court first conviction of the former member of the Khmer Rouge, the judgment of the former leader, the notoriously famous thuggish associations Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as a ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each step forward, increasing restlessness between veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts of reconciliation and their attempts to engage in Cambodia 's company.
`` Between the former Khmer Rouge 's hatred and fear, but they are helpless to do anything, "said Youk Chhang, head of the documentation centre Cambodia, an independent organization, which explores the regime.
`` For them, life was between the Khmer Rouge a beautiful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. "
`` Divides that family. "
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, since 1975 in 1979, was estimated 1,7 million people executed, or died of starvation, on a disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked to overthrow the government, Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its soldiers fled to the cambodian border with Thailand.
There was a rebellion, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guided the guerrilla war of their bases in the mountains and the jungles in Western Cambodia, while the fluid cultivated supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid - 1990 's, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. of a large group of the warriors of the Khmer Rouge began to pace to the government, which culminated in the surrender Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and the fluid, which persisted, was in 1999, was captured by the government forces in the mountains nedalých Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penhském prison in 2006, while waiting for the process.
Their patrons of them nepečovali, most of the former combatants Khmer Rouge sunk to ordinary Cambodia 's rural life, and many of them nostalgically recalled for a period of movement.
Although several elite of the Khmer Rouge maintain its local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
`` Such people from the surrender of a minimum of, "said rival Leang of the Center for Justice and reconciliation, which is a public forum for the whole of Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
`` They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology mode. "
`` They were manners, without any ideas about the implementation of the trade. "
SOR Lim, 55, which came to the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settled as poor farmers in 1998.
`` Life under the Khmer Rouge was good, "he said.
`` The fluid all living. "
`` But now is hard life, because all we must ensure themselves. "
The court of the Khmer Rouge also raised concerns.
At the beginning of the next year will begin to court to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, a former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court 's mandate to prosecute heads of přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but it was not speaking, whether it will continue also in the four cases.
It was just a few to reassure concerns in Anlong Vengu.
The recent speculation media attention to the IM Chaema, 64, which was a district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge at the end of the 1970 s.
In 2007, say researchers from the documentation centre in Cambodia, keeping an eye on the construction of dams Trapeang Thma, project, which may have been killed thousands of compulsory workers.
The recent upon the evening, the IM Chae returned from work in the field to his wooden cottage in dirty way out of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and there were shadows across the parched grass, IM Chae refused to speak about his past between the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called refused to go.
`` In Cambodia of peace and is a stable, "she said.
`` If they appear further prosecution, there will be war. "
Prime Minister Hun Sen that ran from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, too, has repeatedly warned that occurs to instability, if the court to search for more suspects, although the experts and historians disagree.
`` Cambodia must dig a deep hole and buried in the past, "he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what must Cambodia do to move forward, said Youk Chhang from the documentation centre.
`` The reconciliation in khmerským emoluments means cobble together the broken pieces, "he said.
`` It is our duty to give the broken pieces together, so that we could understand. "
The center has made the first book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 parties and the name `` history of democratic Cambodia. "
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June, in addition to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, also young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details on the Khmer Rouge, despite the concentration of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng said that the new textbooks helps students to understand the importance of their history.
But his parents have responded skeptical when he took home book to study.
`` My family refuses to many parts of the books and the courts, "he said.
`` Are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be court to prosecute. "
Such a resistance is reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said rival Leang.
But public Forum, textbooks and the court are beginning to affect, told the further.
The Khmer Rouge here are still strong spell.
Up in the mountains Dangrek Mountains is the road overgrown with weeds and square odhozenými plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
The body Pol Pot here has been burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a salesgirl mobilů on the side of the road, said that he did not know much about the man who was in that place ashed.
`` But it has a strong spirit, many of the local people here goes, and pray to him, "she said.
Nuom Sothea should 's birthday, and was later in the plan to visit a place of rest Pol Pot, where it will bring the volume of ripe bananas, in the hope that it will bring you luck.
Belarus agrees that seems to their weapons stocks on the basis of uranium
In a startling victory in the campaign President Obama 's on ensuring nuclear material around the world, announced Belarus government in the center of abandoning its stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued for the safety of the summit Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynovem.
The US government for years trying to convince Belarus, in order to surrender of highly enriched uranium, and seemed to the worst hit last spring.
But the US officials said the Washington Post, that in the last two months, it was with Belarus carried out a couple of classified operations to eliminate 187 pounds of uranium weapons on the basis of the research facility.
I have paved the way for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to an official, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive issue.
The agreement has turned out to be one of the most important of the results of the Obama 47. national summit on nuclear safety in April, on which was Belarus scrapped.
And he was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former soviet republics at the summit in 2012.
`` I was really fascinated by the fact that they want to place at the summit on nuclear safety 2012. "
`` It shows that process works, "Ken said Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, support groups nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement as `` very important, an important step "from Belarus.
Obama has promised in Prague in April 2009, by ensuring that all sensitive nuclear materials around the world to four years.
Since then, the US government has helped the six countries get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries do so for the management of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear safety announced Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, that his people will never give up its uranium.
`` We are highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds of what is essentially the basis for the gun and less enriched uranium, "he said then Lukashenko.
`` It 's our commodity... do not intend to produce dirty bomb, and it is not to sell. "
`` We use it only for research purposes, that 's all. "
Belarus, however, a few months ago acceded to the United States and made clear interest to reach an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the belarusian uranium in October, was particularly difficult, because the material was slightly irradiated, officials announced.
He was loaded onto the special train, who toured the more than 300 miles into Russia 's facilities for the storage and disposal, officials said.
Second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government for the programme spent 13 million, most of it to the supply of belarusian Research Institute less enriched uranium, for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.

Ambassador also expresses its concern about the political parties Partido Popular (PA; czech People 's Party - attractive.) in this matter.
`` Despite its general pro - american stance of our experience, he says that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to use any indication that Zapaterova government tolerated or deliberately ignored the negotiations with the US, which could be interpreted as a potential violation of human rights, and even in the case, that this discovery could have negative consequences for the government of the United States, "he says.

KDU - ČSL members would gain in the House of Commons 4 chairs and the PSC (Socialist Party Catalonia - attractive.) would have lost 9 mandates
With the results of 28 November the PA could have the word on radnicích in Léridě, Tarragoně and Barcelona.
After a significant increase of their votes, and the number of members of experienced during the recent autonomous elections, katalánská PP (People 's Party Catalonia - attractive. already has the idea of general elections, whether it will increase or not, its prospects are more than a positive, since the number of votes in nationwide elections is usually once such a vote against catalonian.
In 2008 gained katalánští KDU - ČSL members in the general election 610.473 voices, while in the election of autonomous of the year 2006 was this number only 316.222.
Last Sunday gained PPC (People 's Party of Catalonia) 384.091 voice.
If this tendency increases, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of voters PA, analysts that Party calculated that if they are going to be a general elections, PPC could get in the House of 12 members, compared to the current 8, the Party CiU (Convergencia and Unió, czech agreement, and the Union - attractive.) would have also 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would have lost, at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia has for parties and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) of vital importance.
According to this analysis of the ERC (KDU - ČSL member of the left the Republican Party Catalonia - attractive. lost one of a Member of - now has a 3 - while ILE (Green initiative in Catalonia - attractive.) should continue to one 's mandate, where appropriate, would get one another.

Both nationalists and KDU - ČSL members agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragoně, Léridě and Geroně, where the Socialists have received a majority and even they could turn to its traditional allies, the ERC and ILE.
Whereas the debacle Republicans would be impossible, if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona once - as it is necessary to obtain a minimum of 5% of the vote.
The PA has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Léridě and Tarragoně.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turnover in Tarragoně, where they ruled, together with the Party PP against the current mayor, Josepem Félixem Ballesterosem.
In the basement Léridě has only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relations with Marianem Rajoyem - during the last campaign on several occasions, came together.

Seven Pakistanis, and one Nigerijec, who were arrested agents of the General Information station in Barcelona, was the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, who arranges for passports of different groups of Al - Qaeda, among whom were also `` Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam "or `` Lashkar - e - Taiba," with the latter group was the author bombings in Mumbai, in which in 2008 106 died persons.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches investigating the matter of great importance, seeks to ensure that they are using the `` operation "Kampai weakening padělatelského apparatus Al - Qaeda at the international level, and `` limit its operational capabilities."

This broken cell was not the only active, which had a network of jihad in Europe, and that 's why these investigations, in addition to the Thai services also participated in other european police unit, and therefore, it can not be ruled out that, in the days following the event in other european countries, similar to the intervention, as was in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In the context of this operation (which were arrested Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand developed further, in which they have been taken by the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were just these men, who was driving from Bangkok cell based in Spain and the other in other european countries.

This means that the documents had to belong to the men aged 25 to 45 years, had to have a force for several years, and be highlighted without visas.
In the investigative documents, it is emphasised that are not yet known no facts, combining a retention of Catalonia with the assassination in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, `` Lashkar - e - Taiba ," should be one of the groups that have received stolen passports in Spain, and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination was sent from the conversion of Catalonia agency about a thousand dollars, which were `` inserted "for the purchase of cards in mobile phones, which later used were members of the `` a" that killed 106 people.
The police have already foreclosed many evidence.

The President catalonian KDU - ČSL member came to the meeting with Arthur meat with certainty 18 poslaneckých seats received in the election of the last Sunday, which is the number of more than satisfactory for obtaining the popularity, thus candidate CiU needs to be at least one of the formation of the opposition hung vote on his reappointment into office.
The possible agreement with the PA depends on the future of the alliance, which would like to nationalists in the House to maintain, to be held the general election, but so far the talks, resulting in these days of the masses with the rest of the political leaders, latvian bear in mind.

The performance of the Centre Olot do not exclude that their minder killed more than 11 clients
The leadership of the geriatric Centre de la Caritat Olot (Gerona) provided the last press conference to vylíčilo, what damage caused by the institution of the criminal behavior Joan villa Dilmé, orderly, which - while here, he was employed - killed at least eleven of elderly people, which had in the care.
The director of this house for elderly Joan Sala was accompanied by a lawyer equipment, a lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that `` the wishes of the Czech Republic la Caritat would be able to press charges against the culprit "responsible for killing, but `` the legality and responsibility we undertake to give this process of the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the good name, which may this institution suffer because it in time to reveal their guardians of criminal activities, a major threat to the home of la Caritat are now requirements for the physical compensation, which has already been calculated the legal representatives of the bereaved families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already in August 2009, and that since that time to kill
The judge ordered the exhumation eight bodies clients home for the elderly with suspicion that, in many cases, at the dead; no doctor personally, but that, given the age and ill health status of patients, everything vyřizovalo over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its Director resolutely refused to this extreme and pointed out that `` the lack of measures could be in any case, the cause of it, ."
Legal representative la Caritat added that `` in the case, there are no indications that, in addition to its own accused of any third person committed misconduct. "
The man now dubbed `` the angel of death, "said yesterday 11, killing and adds that the first crime committed 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed the old woman.
In this case, the death of the very high dose insulin, unlike the first case, when used a combination of calming pills.

Insulin and cocktail medication may have been in six cases of nine the means by which the minder used to patients killed in his efforts to relieve them from suffering.
But it was only analysis, which now underway in the laboratory, should show whether Vila does not lie and actually looking for its first victim less cruel death or, on the other hand, is killed the liquor, as already admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In a la Caritat does not believe zdravotníkovým claims and do not do not exclude that the number of deaths could be higher than to what was said, and to justify their behavior in the different versions of a villa court with the knowledge that they must change their negotiations, when it became clear that killed eight people.
That 's why they say that they want to be the judiciary available to was illuminated by the whole range of this matter.
The European Central Bank threatens to
Investors yesterday sharply yesterday 's reacted to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who said that `` markets should not be underestimated our ability to respond. "
Marginal diferenciály closed, power, and the European Bank shares fell by more than 5%.
However, should also be underestimated the ability of the European Central Bank 's wrong with the euro - just rose above the critical value.
That 's what yesterday, is typical of illiquid market, which, though, there is a downturn, is recovering - but the short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose concerns.
A month before us, the European Central Bank, cited to reclaim the degree of liquidity, and tomorrow i will have to be for the fourth time within two years of appeal.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy back the national debt for inefficiency and eliminate all emergency measures of liquidity in the period of time and to keep unrestricted access only for a period of one week.
After the crisis, we expect the degree of liquidity forecasts, `` at least until March "and the three - month licitaci with unlimited access to the end of this trimester, so as to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
Also, we hope that they will continue to continue its program buying bonds, and that even to notify his intensify.
Are disappointed if created expectations, creates it again response markets from yesterday, and if you will continue to blindly to resume the degree of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the Congress in May, where they argued that even the thought of buying bonds, and the collapse of the markets - tomorrow might history repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and steadfast.
In May it announced armoured fist on Monday and Wednesday, that they have already bought much, provoking further market collapse.
Yesterday 's bidding bills for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5,28%, compared to the $750 million with 4.81% from the previous sale.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points lower, odrážejíce so change of mood on the market, which occurred after the words Trichet.
In Ireland was published figures constitute a loss of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amount roughly 10,000 million in short - term securities and other potential. 15,000, until February have a chance to become a private capital, or it will be zestátněny.
Even though Ireland has no credibility, then what in July problem reveal stresses tests, the amounts are in the framework of an acceptable plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the government will need to obtain the approval of the new budget Parliament and still do not have sufficient support, so in Ireland to continue to govern the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel ameliorate the tone of his speech to ease tension in the face for the next meeting of the EU leaders held 14 December, on which it is necessary to lead to a political compromise, which would show that we of the Union, and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would rather Beethoven 's Ode to Joy.
In Spain had Prime Minister yesterday, the possibility of presenting action plan, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, the deficit - reduction, privatization, liberalization, measures to boost employment - to the ears of investors that sounds like four seasons from Vivaldi 's.
Double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the stock market has increased by 4,5%, therefore doubly than the rest of the stock market.
Unlike the February was the reaction of the government, and the National Bank of fast and convincing - perhaps we benefit from the effect of surprise.
Today here is the key licitaci bond for three years, which will favour PCBS Trichet, which, we hope, it will be a great demand, which will help alleviate the doubts about our ability to refinance.
Demand for the rescue plan would be for Spain self - sacrifice.
He said he 'd give us cash, which we do not need - in El Tesoro is available to 40.000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates of and access to markets would be closed sine die.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue to use this strategy Cesarovy women - `` is not only that, but also the zdáti ."
We can do it.

The head of the production technology Steve Nevey argue that five years ago, it was possible to say that the advances in research and development of vehicles to contribute to the victory of 50%, and the rest was the result of the riders.
Currently, the ratio is changed and technology is behind the successes of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.

CECA excludes the next wave of mergers thrifts
Director - general CECA said yesterday that should emerge from another wave of mergers, thrift, and again insisted on the speed with which it carries out the reorganization of the sector.
When he started the process of association of spanish thrifts, it was several institutions, which had assured that the first phase of the present and wait for the second round.
But the Director General of the Spanish Confederation thrifts (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled that there should be a new wave of these operations.

`` Most is fully implemented; it is possible that the place of 17 institutions, we will go to the 13 or 14, but all great processes are already finished and under the protection of the National Bank, which in this matter has worked very well, "said the Director.
In their declarations on meeting ADEA (Association of senior executives and Aragon - attractive. Olavarrieta told that the process of concentration of will be `` maximum speed, and we have to be very happy, as shown in instalments is that of our time, not now, appeared in business plans with the spanish National Bank, "said.
`` Go from 45 thrifts with the average volume of assets, 28 000 million to 17 to 75.500 million is the process, which is not in the history of the comparison redukujíce, so the number of institutions about 62%, that these were larger and thus in accordance with the Basel contract, "she stiffed.

Zapatero and red line of german
BERLIN decided to maintain the euro, but set down the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension in the markets of a double the government 's response.
On the one hand he suggested José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from the tax cuts for small and medium - sized enterprises, through the regulation of private agencies or repeal the 426 euro for the unemployed without benefits, after privatisation 49% (AENA spanish airports and air traffic management, manager of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice - president Elena Salgadová with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe is, on the other hand, joined the critiques of to address Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for the launch of the current crisis.
How to interpret this emotion?
So be it in advance that the opinion of Merkel 's mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in a complex process redefinitions of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what is to be his future, which is referring to the idea of compliance with the old traditions, which holds a large part of the other members.
In the face of the European resistance in Germany is beginning to speculate about three ways of the crisis.
The first one is the strong euro zone, which would be, Germany, but also, for example, Austria, and the Netherlands, while the southern states would have left the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - though now it may seem like a science - fiction, this version has a broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the german proposals for a revision of the euro, with more macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigor of, penalties for the offending states, possible delays payment for some of them, and with the enlargement of the possible costs on the regulation on the private sector.
Germany 's position is clear and already had some time defines, so there is no room for evasion by now.
First, when in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission to encourage deficits, pulled from the german government constitutional reform, in order to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of conflict between what Germany regarded as the right (plans fiscal stringency of, and the stability of public finances), and what they were practicing its european partners, including France.
The second showed this central european countries, if Merkel painfully stretched out of the decision on the rescue of Greece.
It was the subject of a serious criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published were heavily against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last October 's days, Merkel again with a clear opinion, when requested to reform the Convention, the European Union so as to allow for the rescue of a Member State, and at the same time, to have a private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti - european, as accelerated the irish crisis, and everything else.
But its proposal, although in a slightly as mitigated by the form, was approved, and over the next few months, we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should from 2013 to enable these measures.
Germany by the red line, which will not exceed.
And all tells us that, although there is now a need to do the measures, which probably too does not agree, from that date will be with an old functioning of the end of the euro.
Year 2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which nations will offending hard sanctioned and may be forced to announce the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also need to bear part of the costs.
Germany us suggests that we have to give a strict way the growth is increasing the savings and investment, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, was in the years boom of the growth of Spain, simply are not going to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we will make a mistake, if they fail to understand.
It is not only on the renewal of the public deficits at 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do, it is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions could happen to us, they were wrong.
I hope that the current turbulence will replace more quiet.
And to take advantage of the opportunity that gives us in the spring of 2013.
It seems that the Prime Minister Zapatero, it also understood and his dual Declaration promised reform after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday 's notification of new measures) suggests that, in spite of criticism of Merkel has opened the way to the idea that there is a need to put things right.
But the red line, which Germany set, it is here, and it does not seem to be with her to move.
And of the options, over which can be considered can not abandon the euro - zone of a serious countries ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to say that the us warned.
Sport and circumvent the rules
Tricks, what do Alonso and Ramos in a struggle with Ajaxem, show the wit not intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly zosnovaná exclusion of two players currency Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the struggle against the Champions League Ajax of 23 November meant that was launched a sea of ink about whether this is or is not unsportsmanlike and whether or not the state - of - the - both footballers punish.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game (who had their team clearly vou take), appointed by the players, one after the other deliberately losing time at the moment when he had a foul play, so as to provoke the judge, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, the two contestants fulfill the punishment in the struggle against the Real Madrid Auxerre - end in his group in the lead - and will be able to, deprived of the cards, continue on to the next phase.
Finally, the Disciplinary Board UEFA coach José Mourinhovi punishment for two games and leading players got a financial penalty.
The provocation yellow cards in similar circumstances, is not a new practice, but it is more or less in football, the normal.
It is so widespread, that is part of the ethos of football, so the rules, which are not unwritten, but they are.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that it was a member of the team Real Madrid (which, in their national anthem boasts magnanimity and honor, and which has a similar actions of his players pokutoval), and as it seems, thanks to the drama, led by the Mourinhem, which was added to its long history actor and provocateur another episode.
In any case, the debate about whether this kind of negotiations, which is not the rules expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of the sport, i. e., whether in these deeds circumvention of the law; it is indeed the actions of respecting sporting rules, whose sense, however, it seems, is trying to bypass.
Dealing with the type of damage such negotiations is a spirit of sport.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical integrity opponents, who was not in these cases violated, or to avoid violent game.
Another one of these formalities characterise the net game is to ensure that the players because of his transgression had vis - à - vis the team opponent advantage - which also here.
Thus, the paradox of action players currency Madrid is the fact that he had not, as normally charakterizujeme as a ruse or circumvention of the law, not to a breach of the rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this behavior should be seen as much as possible in order to obtain a penalty.
Wait and like punishment.
Another question, however, is that the advantage of the guilty from his deliberate infringement will have.
Here, it is to be noted that the opponent getting into the handicaps, and that in the current struggle can not get any benefit, as an obvious result is that team itself will have less players.
And it 's not even a useful strategy to another struggle, since the club will not be able to these players count.
Obviously, the advantage lies in the fact that the players to the next stage of the Champions League without the cards, which might endanger their participation in the future.
However, this is an advantage of the long - term perspective, and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i. e., at first sight, the team may be eliminated, and outside the following negotiations will have players punishment, and go to the second round of cards, in which the exclusion of just about one card less than in the first round.
So what will be the wheels continue, it is not clear whether it is the advantage.
And, in short, these negotiations are against the spirit of sport, which is to make the strategic decisions, which will make it possible to obtain the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the event that we should not players to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather have chosen to obey him.
Did the strategic decision without, avoiding the punishment or fled before him.
Although it is not the borders between the wit and circumvention clear, i believe that, in this case is clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy exists for two reasons: because it was about two samovyloučení and because of the way in which the transfer of instructions to their provoking from the management.
The damage to the sports principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
The fight offers on the holding of Christmas parties in Barcelona

To his six group menu joined the menu Christmas, with the budget on 30 euros or more, as recorded in comparison with the previous year trend guests spend about 10% more in exchange for other items like, for example, is the cava (spanish sparkling wine.

Vice president of the company 's Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the bar, restaurant and centers of free time in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and argue that the number of reservations, `` revived, "although clients `` bargain at maximum."
This impression even during Christmas celebrations yielded to apply to the point.
Pakistan 's nuclear program has produced large unrest in the U. S.
ISLAMABAD produces an atomic weapons of `` at a faster pace than any other country. "
Documents Wikileaks confirmed the links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the US published the portal Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary turmoil in Washington is of Pakistan 's nuclear program.
In addition to the objasňujících and significant detail, which offer as to the content of communications and ideas of the representatives of the North American Free Trade diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries, as regards the nuclear safety, instead, to increase, `` is on the wane ," and that this unstable asian country produces more `` nuclear weapons than any other state."
The uniqueness of Pakistan 's nuclear program - that its weapons are assembled, but stored after works, to be made more difficult to their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington, D. C.
This is calculated Ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in a single report before the visit to the national security advisor, James Jones: `` the proximity of some of the nuclear device vis - à - vis the territory under the control of the Taliban, the spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials ."
An increase in the number of persons connected with nuclear arsenály and with the missile is no longer observed, only the US, but also of Russia, like a widening and representing a reason to be on your guard.
`` Pakistan had to protect the nuclear equipment hire staff with strict religious faith; whereas the decline of the level of education and culture have extremist organizations more opportunities recruit people, who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes missile ," said expert Yuri Korolev of Russia 's Ministry of Foreign at a meeting with their counterparts, from the US.
The biggest novelty documentation published by the server Julian Assangeho is increasingly less cooperation between the US and Pakistan in topics the spread of nuclear weapons and increased pace of Pakistan 's production of these weapons.
The trap issued by the Embassy in May, the assessment of communication with Pakistan as `` frustrating, "says: `` transparency often does not exist; offers of help remain without a response, or are refused."
In the next report says Peter Lavoy, worker national intelligence services for the South Asia that `` despite the economic catastrophe produces Pakistan nuclear weapons as fast as no other country in the world. "
Ambassador Pettersonová also demands of Washington to during his visit to the Chief of Army General Ashfaqa Kayaniho, `` very well, "explained that `` the Pakistani army must end with the support of the terrorist groups."
The hunt for the boss Wikileaks
Obama 's name of a high - ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, in order to avoid the new evasion of information.
Interpol issued a `` red challenge, "with a view to trace and identify where would assange could be.
All concerning Wikileaks and its founder of Julian Assangeho is a complicated labyrinth, where it 's hard to be sure the facts.
Interpol yesterday said `` extraordinary challenge, ," i. e., red bass, to locate the `` and monitoring of movement" Assangeho.
But this is a classic command to detention.
Besides, the challenge is not new, but it dates back to 20 November.
And he has nothing to do with the release of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, assures the legal representative of the creator Wikileaks Mark Stephens, that `` the police know where and how to contact with Mr. Assangem ."
It has been 20 November, when the chorus of international police located in the french Lyon issued this command, at the request of Sweden, credit, but it until yesterday, when it has received permission from the swedish authorities.
In this situation has 188 countries Interpol instructions to identify or localizing Assangeho `` with a view to impose the temporary custody and give it. "
Although the Interpol can not order the arrest of persons, which relates to the red challenge, many Member States, both organizations explained, however, considered the so - called `` red notice for allowing the arrest of do - it must be ensured national component of the police - especially in the case where Member States have mutual agreement on the issue of detainees, as is the case in Sweden, and in England, where would probably be assange should be.
This step demoted Assengeho lawyers who yesterday published in writing, where the claim that the 39 - year - old wikileaks founder willing to answer the questions of the swedish authorities by means of the video conference.
Recall that Assenge asked and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from accompany Athos of your case, compared with the legendary Lavrentijem remorse Berijou, chief of Stalin 's security.
`` This is the hunt and no legal persecution, "the letter.
While it is looking for the whole world - and from Australia, his mother defend the innocence of his son - assange is off to an unknown place, but the gun silent.
On Monday, provided by Skype from an unknown place interview Time magazine editor - in this conversation requested the resignation of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
`` If it proves that it was responsible for the U. S. diplomats, to implement the espionage in the UN and broken and the International Convention, which the United States signed, should resign, "he said.
His views were yesterday rejected the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who claim to qualify as `` ridiculous and absurd. "
`` I am not sure why you should care about the view of the machine, which operates a Web page, "he said in a CNN.
Obama himself responsible for high - ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella TRAVERSE, in order to prevent further releases documents.
The speaker of President Barack Obama stop add Assangemu on the importance of the stands in stark contrast with the views of these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, member of Congress, which will be since January, chairman of the Committee for the national security in the lower house, i asked for the State Department to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks between a terrorist organization, `` in order to be able to intervene and prosecuted anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance. "
Further went Tom Flanagan, advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that `` assange should be killed ," which in turn had to appeal.
`` Obama would have had a reward or use unmanned aircraft or something like that. "
Who apologized, was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, a former guvernátor Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
`` Everyone will be in government, the one who is responsible for the leak, has committed treason and any other than the execution would be too modest, "he said at the station Fox
Puigcercós looking for in the ERC peace of `` wink, "the followers of Caroda
The Republican Party leader will allow a secret ballot of its survival.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and the end of the schůzovního system.
Joan Puigcercós seem to have found a recipe for fighting already několikátou internal rebellion in the ranks of the ERC (left - wing Republican Party Catalonia, useless because of the loss of 11 members and half of the vote.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture with respect to the resignation of seems to his supporters of the former leader Josepa Lluíse Caroda - Roviry inadequate, and also knows that the impact of this sector is now the already weakened as its leader, and that he absolutely can not do so worried, what was with other living currents.
Therefore, the leader of the left to try to get a new criticism by means of a twinkle, then, that will help him steel himself in the municipal elections.
First Puigcercós yesterday announced that more than 200 members of the National Committee shall be able to secretly say in his continuance in office.
By using the ballots, rather than a show of hands.
If they want to supporters Caroda forward to the chairman of the criminal voice, so they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid disruption and surrender their person.
In several interviews, argued that would be considered a confirmed with half of the vote, and one, moreover, but added, without clarified percent, it would also be a good outcome for `` Bulgaria ."
Supporters Caroda require the chairman of the more than to give its function available - which are considered as a gesture, which has no weight, since Puigcercós controls at conferences, the largest authority.
But, given that they do not have sufficient majority in order to enforce the resignation, will seek to remind the executive plan from now until May.
Because i expect to participate in the development of a document on strategic reorientation, which can lead to a vote of the National Council of 18 th day of the month.
Their aim is to promote Puigcercóse in exchange for this promise to move the Congress has already in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that the `` mnohohlasnost "is to the detriment of stability, and that it 's aim is to once and for all, was the organization able to fight their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems that the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercósův ideologue, this advisor to upgrade took for granted that the leader of the `` will be confirmed in exchange for several objectives. "
And the name of five, of which are two.
The first is the `` překomponování "executive so as to form a at least 90% of the members, which means also include new faces, who are from the sector friendly Carodovi.
The second objective may be big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC completely put an end to schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of operation.
And so is fighting for reform of the statutes, in order to be able to take place congresses through the delegates of the selected by a vote.
To put an end to the model schůzovního system, the exemption in the spanish system of political parties, is intended to Puigcercósova team, which in this direction fought already on the last two conferences.
However, the cramped Assembly of the year 2008 has decided that schůzovnictví must be assessed on a special Congress on reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the Party discouraged from a solution to this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, could be an appropriate time again this issue finther and try to her once and for all.

The majority of the members of the Commission concludes that traffic report was such that suicide can not be seen as a solution to the issues of the day - to - day life.
`` Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes broadcasting "Dupontových lunch reports of `` the delicate topic impartial and in an appropriate manner."
It was not against him raised no criticism.
The last of the dispute was declaration that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean - René Dufort is thus put into a firefight media, which caused many responses.

450 million contracts without competitions
Hydro - Quebec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in the contracts with firms providing Engineering at hydroelektrický project Eastmain - 1 - and - Sarcelle - Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it 's just a consortium created from firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the contract, the contract for the management of the whole project in the total amount of 295 million dollars without public competition.
The consortium, on behalf of the Energy gérance was in 2004 authorised in parallel with the choice of the company 's Hydro - Quebec, to committing to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this important hydroelektrického project in the $5 billion.
At the beginning of the year 2005 a consortium of `` Energy gérance "has become a lucrative contract without any publication of a public competition.
For quebeckou side of the complaint to a consortium of business before us building a serious problem ethical nature, which is in danger of exclusion of competition and carries a price increase..
`` It 's a new way to implement collusive action and to eliminate the competition. "
`` That means that people have an agreement, do not secretly, there is now doing openly, "said yesterday, a member of the PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier this morning, M. Simard asked the question of the National Assembly, because he says that he is, how can be sold to the public interest as follows.
The Minister for natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, afternoon argued forcefully popírajíc, that would be good for this contract on the collusive action.
`` I have my own way, "bellowed and claimed that the PQ was `` dishonest" and `` lacked the accuracy. "
She said, `` it would be the least "that the PQ apologized.
A recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually the alliance, limited in time to allow the two or more undertakings group of their mutual expertisy, in order to respond to the call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
Project Eastmain is a very complicated with regard to obsáhlost work.
The construction is running and must be phased in 2012.
However, the contract was awarded, without competition can act; it was business.
It is also necessary to admit that form of consortia is no longer in Quebec exception, and even for relatively simple projects.
How to expose the last week of Le Devoir, form of consortia in consultancy in engineeringu is the subject of a criminal investigation in the government.
Přelétneme if in the business register quebeckých firms, will allow us to appear more than 200 consortia, with some seem to be created by a permanent.
Thus, the company of Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors; i Cima +, Génivar, DK - Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that 's Dessau.
As regards the consortium Energy gérance, Minister Normandeauová underscored, in particular, the fact that `` the territory of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamism of the work force, and that Hydro - Quebec on her responds since the 1970 s. ."
The main patron of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from energy companies Baie James (SEBJ), explain that make us svraštit forehead on the fact that the contract for the management of the project was concluded by mutual agreement.
`` If you are going to a public competition, and if it is little participants competition, making the offer, your offered price might be higher. "
`` You have a choice of two options: i. e., taking the people who are in the contract as participants competition, and you will say: 'let' s make a deal satisfactory, and with a good price. "
`` But the main idea is that important is the price, but the powers of the people, "said Mr. Laporte.
This Treaty granted a consortium of Energy gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50 000 $, who received a party of Quebec.
The contracts were concluded with the company Hydro - Quebec or SEBJ on the project Eastmain - 1 - and - Sarcelle - Rupert.
After verification of Le Devoir counted 109 contracts on the advice of engineeringu, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out analyses of the soil samples.
DK - Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, from the Génivar of them gained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without a share in the `` Energy gérance ."
All the contracts were concluded.
The combined total $449 783 344, including the contract with the company Energy gérance to 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies, which are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are `` very good friends of the liberal parties Quebec. "
The Minister Normandeauová launched a report that the PQ is also associated with firms, which her `` finance ," before he explained that rather on its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - `` green "label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumer very little trust actors, sustainable development, but also `` neutral "brands and environmental certificate, to the driving in the selection of products.
The worst of it is that, even when he bathed in the media space, which on us urges and calls for socially responsible consumption, wailing this media space above the lack of credible information, failure to comply with his obligations, which qualifies as a brake for its commitment, says Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article appeared yesterday.
Even though in 2010 consumption increased for example socially responsible products, the inhabitants of Quebec, who try to sell them, but he did not believe them
Two - thirds of us, in fact, they say that they do not trust the promises of companies, relating to the environment, simply because the green advertising company, he finds measuring instrument, which has developed a Observatory responsible consumption University Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumer doubts about the credibility of the official certificate, přikládaných on for example of a fair products, but also about the credibility of the products and marks, which is referred to as environmentally responsible, says barometre.
In the same way, policymakers debate on this topic is taken as a serious only 14,6% of the population of Quebec.
Information about the responsible consumption, however, seems to be the first to stimulate consumption of this page revived currently nearly one - third of quebeckých consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and doubtful character of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
That 's the second brake, that he identified Baromètre, after a higher price of these products.
Indeed, one - third of the population Quebekuse puts suspiciously against any data on products or `` green "services, we are seeking to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010 was almost half of consumers willing to change your habits, and especially to change the mark of one or several products, which would have reacted to his conviction.
Whole 61% of them favoring purchases for traders from their neighborhoods, preferring to purchase food, grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More `` green "and responsible - index responsible consumption reached 64 from a maximum of 100 for this year - homo consumus Québeku likes to be presented as the King of recycling, which seeks to minimise the environmental impact of the old on the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of the population of Quebec said that the use of public transport, or that they recommend the use of the car to travel by at least two persons, in the interests of the protection of nature.
Walk round and also supported on 39,1% of the participants of this extensive survey behavior, who used this cliché.
The loan of the State to buy back the complex cinemas eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the cinema eXcentris companies Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the complicity, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Developperská company `` Angus et le Parallèle "that sought to gift in the amount of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture for purchase of cinematographic complex on the boulevard Saint Laurent and that has demonstrated its role as a lover of film, failed to obtain it, as requested.
The government accepts that will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than expected gift proposes a government Quebec loan, which would be lower, there had been expectations, which could form the basis for a viable solution for favourable conditions and resources comes from the State.
The first action plan, and the requirement to 12,8 million have already been rejected Quebekem last spring, but applications have been revised reduction.
Proposal for a plan of action and sent the minister of St Pierre - president of the Society for the development of business in the culture of (SODEC), François Macerola, which controls the film project eXcentris.
The final report was sent to ten days ago.
But the counterclaim government came into society SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have time to 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the hypothesis gift from the state must really be rejected.
It is noted that the cinema owners and cinematographic Center in Quebec was built against the direct investment State to support the redemption eXcentrisu, usuzujíc that the culture minister does not have to finance the project on real estate, as it has done for other kinosály.
But several participants discussions, on the contrary, demanded a fundamental economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into space of their cinemas in ten years film after he was financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the amendment of the financial of the Council of State.
The lack of halls for independent films is stark in Montréalu, and eXcentris could obtain permanent clientele.
The company Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his forehead, governed by the campaign for the release of funds to the private sector, in the belief that the matter of $700 000 for extrude acquisitions.
In the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute movies for eXcentris.
The aim of the future of purchasers is open to all three of the halls of 27 February next year, and now the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini reminded Le Devoir and ignores, so he and his group thinks about the proposals to reduce it, which made.
By the curtain on Canada as a whole.
The new american diplomatic sources referred to in the known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considered inferiority complex Canadians of Americans, but the same stroke betray their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprising that on each canadian voters lies at the heart of kanadsko - american relations, when it comes to vote, and believes that President Obama 's visit to help the conservative government to was adopted its budget in 2009.
Four new messages between the U. S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday landed on display public, provide details, moreover, sensitive to get the `` under the skin. "
Communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i. e., in the middle of the electoral campaign, detailing the at what point the United States is not part of the deal, the political leaders.
To the surprise of the U. S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides to this situation several explanation.
`` The canadian inferiority complex, almost always expressed, makes possible political leaders to talk about the internal stakes, instead of realized that these elections concerning the United States (as in the campaign for free trade in 1988), "writes.
`` The United States are, therefore, "concluded, `` the elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but too potentially threatening to about them all."
The ambassador means that `` the silence "mean less that both countries maintain an intense political and economic relations.
`` It is logical that the capacity of the candidate, the parties or, better still party leader to manage these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they are going to vote. "
Other expression of this sense of importance can read in the report, which was sent on 22 January 2009, Terry Breese, Chargé d 'Affaires in Ottawa in Ottawa, in preparation for President Barack Obama to his first visit Ottawa.
`` Your path will help to ensure that the government in the vote of confidence in the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget, which Canada publicly admit to his first deficit for more than ten years, owing to the recovery plan of 30 - 40 billion, "writes M. Breese.
There was no mention of the fact that the government had to get a pre - christmas of Parliament, so that it can not be slaughtered coalition and that opposition parties makes his survival of the quality of the proposed a recovery plan.
Another message from January 2008 and signed the ambassador Wilkins, points out in Washington on increasingly negative image, which in the United States cast a dramatic works broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the emission of the border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H 2 O, in which can be seen not too clever references to Maher Arar, `` well - Fly - list "or also on the kidnapping of for the purposes of violent questioning of the CIA.
Another message presented that, in their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his french partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to take some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of `` case - by - case basis. "
At the end of the meeting, it says here, `` he gave some paper, concerning the Omar Khadr, 15 - year old Muslim of canadian origin, the secretary of state. "
`` The Minister has adopted, with the folder revising ."
Finally, it should be noted that the person concerned wikileaks sweat.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor to the very close to the Harpers, said Stephen on the waves CBC, that the person responsible for this massive hemorrhage should be `` destroyed. "
The word is that i heard about it, Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The world 's plan to rebuild lighting
The UN 's last proposed in Cancun plan for the reconstruction of the domestic lighting, lighting shops and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to limit the greenhouse effect (G), which is almost one third of further restrictions, which is to achieve a Stabilisation climate of the planet from now on by 2020..
This ambitious plan is located in the stage of the large specific projects, which wants to impose the UN in Cancun, in order to compensate for the lack of a difficult for commitments to reduce the industrialised countries.
According to the plan submitted last night, if the incandescent light bulbs, which monopolize the 50 to 70% of the market, will replace bulbs fluokompaktními or, better yet, bulbs with elektroluminiscentními diodes (DEL or `` ice "in English), the quantity of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) Ges emissions on the planet arising out of lighting would odbouralo.
Lighting is responsible for the 8% of the world 's emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the vehicle fleet on the planet.
In Copenhagen in the last year, the big countries with a significant proportion of on issues like the United States, China, Europe and other, among them, Canada, engaged in the voluntary plans to reduce, which should allow the decline in global emissions Ges from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be deducted from this balance of 5 more Gt, to be achieved by 2020, Stabilize heating climate on 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude, he can not get out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs 95% of the energy is dissipating in the form of heat, and the rest, i. e. 5%, is the product of light.
Having fluokompaktními bulbs, consumption of energy reduces the 75%, and with new light bulbs with DEL, narrow it down this consumption twice more.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs will hold on average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new light bulbs with DEL, such as stated this week in the production of the Philips - this company allegedly participated in the study of the UN - have life expectancy 25 000 hours and consumes about 80% less energy than incandescent light, which gives us an idea of possible savings with a plan of the refund, which would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs may also work with reostaty and emit less heat.
And do not contain any mercury.
A few experts have expressed reservations about fluokompaktním light bulbs, because they contain mercury and should be as a sort of hazardous waste, which is still possible in developing countries, unless the producers established a junkyard.
But, as the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet 's fluokompaktní bulb, but rather the thermal coal - fired plants that emit many mercury necessary to produce the electricity wasted in the incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States of these headquarters put into circulation 25 000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also states in detail the profits from the international programme each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO 2, which is the equivalent of 3,5 thermal power stations, whose construction would cost 2,5 billion
Côte d 'Ivoire awaits the outcome of the election results.
The UN Secretary General Ban Ki - Moon,, necessitating immediate public disclosure of the results of the presidential election in Côte d 'Ivoire after the expiration of the time limits laid down.
`` The Secretary - General stresses the need for an independent of the Electoral Commission has finished his work, and immediately said preliminary results, for President of the United Nations. "

About 40 minutes before expiry President CEI on tv, confirmed that the Commission 's `` continues to work, "to declare the results.
In the center in the world - 11 appeals to CEI declared at last, the winner of the second round, between the ceding Laurent Gbagbo and a member of the opposition Alassanem Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Board for `` fraudulent "vote in the north, which is administered by former guerrillas new Army (FH) from the failed the coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi n 'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Ivory Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers intimidating voters, which has practiced FN (a new Army) in the north of the country, discouraged supporters, president of Côte d' Ivoire from it, to go to vote.
Elections could be avoided if the Constitutional Board to take into consideration to complain, which he handed Gbagbo.
Of course, the opponents of the President 's Gbagbo consider that the Supreme Court of the country is not neutral, because it is governed by Paul Yao n' Dré, very close to a political ally President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man from the North, who dementuje any connection with the former guerrillas, condemned the delay in the notice of the results of such as `` unacceptable "and asked Gbagba, to be respected, but so far, that would have demanded a victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that suffered a loss of, and that of a complaint to the Constitutional Board after the Commission broadcast defended the election results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, the ongoing on Sunday, it was considered a coronation process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that is no longer divided into two half.
The United Nations highlighted in the center of the political faction Ivory Coast, that could be held liable for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended up in the first round, 31 October, as a winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattaru, who won the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

`` Come on noise ," they say, `` always strongly vyslovujte" in the media, the words `` the basic rights of man ," `` innocence," `` immediate release ."
It is necessary to bring to the difficulties of the iranian regime, sensitive to his image.
`` Do it the more, the more you will demand, so as not to stop. "
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through channels, `` discreet silence will not solve anything, "i. e., the Iranians are `` masters on 's evasive maneuvers."
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners' s `` iranian family tactic: a hostage taking "for the purposes of political blackmail."
Announces that the exemption Klotildy Reissové (which is 16 August, on the day when it will provide a safe haven of the French Embassy), `` will require payment of a large amounts of money, the Iranians " (bail 230 000 EUR).
And shall notify that elysejský palace anticipates hostage cases, the phenomenon that, `` will vyostřovat ."
The Iranians would `` in the future could arrest of other about 1800 of the french living in Iran, "says.
28 Aug 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left jail before 12 days, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: the iranian Majid Kakavand, of which the United States proclaim that he was expelled for illegal trade with electronic sensitive material in relation to Iran 's in Paris set free on the basis of the judge' s decision.
The U. S. embassy, as well as many observers requires this unsettling compliance.
For the Washington, which is illegal Iran 's network to the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, is the extension of Majida Khakavanda bad news.
France came to bargain?
The Iranians for the liberation of young women?
In a further conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, 4 September, François Richier assured that this is not so.
Elysejský palace, notes, was not only `` surprised by this Decision Judge ," but for the possibility to face it.
`` Have been held talks between the presidency and the Minister of Justice " (at that time, Michèle, Michele Alliot - Marie,), but `` the french government can not change the decision of the court," notes.
Mr. Richier wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under `` restricted "the supervision of the french intelligence services.
Advisor to the Elysée is making a phone number, hanging up the phone and then inform the american diplomat, that the iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by Iran 's Embassy ."
At the time of their imprisonment Klotildy Reissové in Iran 's evolving elysejský palace efforts, negotiate, by means of communications and organised by `` losses "in the media, to see that the syrian President Bachar al - Assad plays a `` major" and `` an influential "role of `` the mediator."
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation of bears fruit, because a few articles in the press reflects the official version of the French.
A telegram from 25 August 2009 evokes media `` blest "of french official agents."
What is this level of `` gratitude ," expressed vis - à - vis the M. Assadovi, asks embassy in Paris.
`` Despite their declaration of chvalořečí french official officials in the privacy of recognize that they have a vague idea of what the Syrians actually made. "
The document is then deals with the reasons, which forced elysejský palace pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication `` towards the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy 's opening with Syria, analyses. "
Policy applied in 2008, `` was observed many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as the early and undeserved ."
The `` how far the syrian role ," the `` Paris trying to demonstrate Syria, what eulogium can earn when he played a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also `` plant grain of this excitement between Syria and Iran. "
The american embassy knows it from a very good sources.
11 August, François Richier, he said: `` we do not know, of course, if the Syrians did something, whatever it is. "
`` But we thanked them very much. "
`` It should at least befuddle and confusion between the Iranians ."
Klotilda Reissová returning to France 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy it accepts in the Élysée Palace.
In a press thanking presidents Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their `` active role for the benefit of the exemption of our a fellow - countrywoman ."
The end of the on - line game after midnight for young korean guy
South Korea 's government adopted by the law, called the `` peciválský, "which will prohibit adolescentům play on - line game after midnight, that block access to them, they said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December, so that he could ask companies operating on - line game of blocking access to these games after midnight to anyone under 16 years, the leaders of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
`` Many children playing these games all night and then have problems with learning in school, and they are not able to lead a normal life during the day. "
`` We believe that the law is necessary for it, to ensure their health and their right to sleep, "said for AFP yeah Rin, the leading factor in the Ministry of, which has a bill to worry about.
On - line game will be newly accessible from 6 in the morning.
The company will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, clarified.
The government also assumes that, at the request of the company to limit the day - to - day time access to these games for young, whose parents so requests, the said responsible official.
It can also be available to people who request it, free programs to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by the `` "and the daily press regularly brings different facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is at the same time, the undisputed master in the world 's competitions in on - line games.
In November, South Korea has four gold medal at the World Cyber Games, and it in the face of 58 other peoples.
The World Cup in the years 2018 - 2022: Fifa establishes the host country.
Full riots suspicion of corruption establishes the Executive Committee Fifa Thursday in the host country 2018 World Cup and 2022, the selection of the most politically motivated, where the fight for control and lobbying by the risk that surpassing technical criteria.
To be sure, the Royal Fifa in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain - Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium).
The World Cup, it will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hopes to able to conquer the new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the african continent in 2010, or to continue to support to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
List of people who participate in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Zapatero Rodriguez, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the prince from Qatar, senior government officials Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create the idea of the scale of the economic and political bets around the world.
The negotiations in the wings faces the risk that will take until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy, according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fifa documentation english, Spain - Portugal (2018) and the US (2022) containing the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But this will not have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission in an hour of the vote.
Sunday Times, in the early detection, leading to a suspension of two members of the EC / EU Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adam), maybe so destroyed the chance of their country, the cradle of football, which so far hosted by the World Championships only once, in a year.
The BBC it on Monday, put on the crown, when aired document that `` impaled on a pin "three influential members of the CE (the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How do we make Fifa nespokojenou and get into difficulties english leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
President of the Government hopes that he will be able to move again, who succeeded his predecessors in function Tony Blair, which in 2005, managed to get to London organization of the Olympic Games in 2012.
It will be enough to this intense activity to England added new lustre his name in the CE (the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because of a pair of Spain - Portugal missing Trumps already prepared stadiums, his bill (the World Championships in 1982 in Spain, 92 Olympics in Barcelona, the euro - 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions cold shower.
Any reprisals against the English and doubts about the payment of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was a basket case, despite the gap in his dossier (stadiums, hotels, right).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the World Cup put into Zurich and publicly declared a `` unfair competition in the preparation of the vote, "in verbal innuendo hardly twisted to the charge of the english print of the members of the European Commission (EC).
`` We will be on them to throw mud, we will try to a compromise, "said Mr. Poutin.
For the year 2022 appear to be the logical choice, the United States, with its extensive experience of 1994.
The highest in the world economy, the seat of the major sponsors Fifa, it seems that the country has a great advantage in Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produce beautiful project.
But these candidacy seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 took a `` rehearsal ."
Another threat: the World Cup 2026 China, which was dying wishes Fifa, made of Asia 's chances for the year 2022 invalid.
Having Qatar, which he drew from his sleeve big ace in the form of a futuristic stadiums and Australia would Fifa continued its expansion into new lands, but these two countries represent more than the risk of securities.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, would pay for poor fees tv (due to the time lag) paid european countries, forming a powerful force for Fifa.
The second mandate: zřejmost (the `` Jistota ")
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up the impression that hesitates.
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac nezaváhali did not in the least.
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than they are.
The mandate of the palace elysejskému summoner someone else.
The current head of state will therefore candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost is in harmony with a share of the mystery of the associated with a presidential functions.
It is therefore necessary to do, as if in doubt constantly persisted.
In one sense, even in the second.
In 2006, without it wanted to believe, Jacques Chirac 's friends do unto claims to third mandate was excluded.
Nov. 15, with a serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy said that `` we decide sometime in the autumn of the year 2011. "
How reminds before the members of Parliament UMP, in the middle of the night in the Élysée Palace, the perspective of `` two terms "planted little feverish state.
It was official notice of his candidacy?
He was not far from it.
President only reminded that the adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 to reduce the number of five years in office on two.
It was from his party just a statement, no notification.
This is not the first time he recalled at such meetings comic tone of the presidential elections.
`` In the worst case, or in the best case, you have a seven and a half years to me, "he said in July 2009.
The rebellion in May 2010: `` do not think that i am on the next stage. "
The day before yesterday 's statements, it does not make a candidate for more than the previous day; it does not make a candidate or less.
If the cause comment, it is due to the double the truth.
Speed up the path to run into the PA, on the one hand.
But that 's entry into the arena Ségolèna Royal, what is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is, therefore, that his candidacy in 2012, it is obvious that many in the PA to order to combat reports, rather than premature intended.
A survey, on the other hand.
First, the right - wing voters would prefer the nomination Francois Fillon before the candidacy Nicolas Sarkozy 's (46% against 44%, according to the BVA - L' Express).
`` We have a candidate and not discussing about the matter with the UMP, "responded immediately and wary of the people in the vicinity of the President of the government.
`` If they believe possible defeat, will not run, "says Jean - Pierre Raffarin.
`` She will still believe that can win ," repairs Alain Juppé, balanced, unlike.
The euro: the European Central Bank to continue their buying government titles.
The last of the meetings of the Governing Council of the central in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the rationale of the crisis, or, at least, the notice of termination of a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis sovereign debt to the European Institute for the issue of the securities will undoubtedly be able to afford to be so many of the attitude under the threat of the deterioration of the situation now so intent on european securities markets.
The political price would be about it later.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conferences French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to an active role played by the European Central Bank in favor of the crisis management claims of european states.
I did not want to tell whether he thinks that the bank could do more to it, for example, that would have increased its program of the purchase of sovereign bonds.
`` I reserve your account for my european partners (...) ."
The evening before that, in Brussels, during his interrogation of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean - Claude Trichet, did not show up as výřečnější, as regards his intentions, and contented himself with it, he stated that the purchase of a state titles in the secondary market `` continues, "and that `` we will see how decide" during the meeting to be held this Thursday.
The only security: the European Central Bank will keep its basic constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds are made by the Central European Bank has doubled in the last week on nearly 1.35 billion.
And, thanks to the foolishness dohodců on the market has made the last new purchases of irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central bank 's eurosystému bought on 67 billion from May 2010.
Between dealers in the sense of anticipation of continuation of purchases permitted no doubt (see page 29).
Neither the economists expect any significant change course.
If the operation of the loans for more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal of central european banks, these latter Bank for an unlimited provision of liquidity in accordance with generous conditions, and for the duration of the from one week within three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for several months.
`` I can not imagine that changed significantly to its program. "
`` If not, it would mean to take the risk of short - term new tensions, "says Michael Schubert, an economist Commerzbank.
`` Progressive way out of the notified during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely, "anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist for Sal.
Oppenheim.
The plan of its intervention on the market, with public debt, `` would have to the European Central Bank to maintain the volume of the purchase of its obligations to revive the faint market, "added Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of european banks on markets with the sovereign debt in the euro area has continued to the selection of anything other than to maintain their presence on the market.
`` He needs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of paid by the performance of the States, belonging among the most fragile, "said yesterday, a significant Manager of the bonds.
Because if interest rates rose and fell, will be with states that more trouble to reduce their debt, rather than stabilized.
It 's the rescue of the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi 's drooping wearily back
After the start of the week for Italy worrying situation is more relaxed, yesterday to the flow of the bond of interest to 10 years.
BACK to temporarily quiet.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for the economy of the regions, they said, they heard Giulio Tremonti, as the assessment of the situation as `` nerozřešitelnou, "and that the expected to `` unpredictable," the weekend, which then order issued a statement denying.
In any case, Tuesday deviation from long german interest to have reached record 210 basis points and price contracts for cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points, which in Rome caused some excitement.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the derogation with german interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he was `` too busy, "`` the markets" and possible contagion originating from Ireland.
`` The good news is that of Italy, the third of the euro - zone economy, it is not like Greece or Ireland. "
`` The bad news is that it 's like Portugal, "explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, and the clear, the problem is the lack of growth and a weak fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the risk that will not be able to cover its financing requirements.
The latest forecasts Brussels were for the government cold shower.
Italy 's growth is now expected to 1,1% in 2011 and on 1,4% in 2012... while the budget, which is available to the Senate to his analysis, on 1,3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the calculation, the European Commission will be public deficits represent a 4,3% of gross domestic product in the next year (against 3,9% of the Government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Here the reputation of a new set of amendments to the draft budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, the $7 billion.
`` If necessary, it will have to be adopted strict new measures ," assess the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy 's accepts the support of the international institutions.
`` The cornerstones of its economy are in order, and its calculations are correct, we repeat it has been a long time, "asserts Arrigo Sadun, italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
`` There 's no immediate problem, not short - term or long - term, because, despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), it' s efforts to stabilize the required in Italy, less than the efforts required from other countries, "notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist OCDE.
The question remains of political instability.
14 December will be Silvio Berlusconi face the proposal of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and subsequently after that might be able to organize elections envisaged at the end of March.
Launched the period, few suitable for the adoption of a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the strengthening of protikrizových mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde it yesterday reiterated in the framework of the press conference in Paris: `` i think that Europeans it demonstrated in Sunday during the day and night, are clearly very solidarity intent, committed to defend its currency, its currency zone. "
Although everything is relative, yesterday 's recorded expansion, in respect of interest at the european government bonds, brought the water for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can not even talk about the beginning of standardisation.
The Office for the notation Standard &amp; Poor 's announced that he could outrank record of debt Portugal, the objectives, which is the most important different speculation.
`` Because in May 's real insufficiently transparent and clear policy, based in particular on banking systems, "says the economists Exane BNP Paribas.
The more that `` the political time is running more slowly than the time the market. "
Of this interrupted context and danger, which lies, intensify european countries discussions, to strengthen the existing mechanisms of crisis.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers, most concerned the problem, and on a wider scale with their counterparts from the G - 20, evolve very well.
And it with regard to the meeting of the Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin since the early next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank shall be held today.
The programme is the fate of non - conventional measures in support of the euro - zone countries, with a focus on markets (see above).
As regards the European Fund Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, zapořčal Tuesday in Singapore path across Asia, with a view to inform investors from the Far East on the development of the crisis in Europe.

Reforms that are attached to stringent measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon, and Madrid another way, than the use of Greece and Ireland.
Both countries to avoid that it would have asked for international assistance before use their own budget korektivy and than to decide on structural reforms necessary to ensure that had once again won a permanent confidence.
Equity participants in the european funds finally speaks about the options, available for accelerating the process of standardisation markets with sovereign bonds.
In his trip to Paris 24 November Axel Weber came up with the idea that would not be enough 750 billion mobilized Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to touch the supply of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is the player, the first plan trade with european sovereign debt, believes that the addition of approximately 100 billion should do it, `` i 'd rather "in the form of a direct financial liquidity.
The resource exists: it is the mechanism of financial stability, which on that date 60 billion.

Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since it is the debate on the modernisation of transport on Ile - de - France in full swing, it 's raining billion.
At least during discussions.
It is recalled especially 23 billion for the underground Grand Paris, which is to build a company of Société du Grand Paris.
To this building could be started, announced the provision of the state subsidy of $4 billion.
Theoretically, it 's the amount to allow the company SGP used to contracts part of the financing of her dual resources.
Today 's finally getting to the first amendments.
Rectifying the law on finances in 2010, which explores the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms laid down to ensure that these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax equipment and an increase in the tax office on Ile - de - France.
First, let 's finish in the text of the proposal of the law, Article 15, is `` in favour of public institutions of Société du Grand Paris ."
Is denominated: `` return on this interest is 117 million a year ."
The second is the reconstruction of rates for the office, which already exists, `` to be modernized, in order to increase the yield on her obtained and to this increase touched Société du Grand Paris ."
How much would it work?
A mirage.
It 's not quantified in the text.
In 4 billion is far away.
`` It is clarified that these fiscal resources are attached to the 4 billion of capital grants, which will be mobilized State and inserted into the Société du Grand Paris, according to the project, "we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
Us in the company of the SGP this system seems shocking.
`` Since we have created a revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then grab into 4 billion, explains here. "
`` It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary. "
The SGP is considered that 4 billion will be credited to in 2013 budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism, in which promised 4 billion is still absent abonentům, it runs the risk that will cause a sort of parliamentary debate.
The first meeting of the public 's 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and přičinliví spies
Case WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it is exposed manifest scandal, scandal, which seems to be the only in the face of hypocrisy, which shall be governed by the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, indicative of the deep changes at the international level, and anticipates future ruled by regression.
But let 's go over in order.
The first aspect of wikileaks, it is a fact that any document drawn up by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of printing cuts.
`` Extraordinary discovery "Americans about the way of life sexually Berlusconi 's reported that what you are already for months, everyone can read in any (all except those two Berlusconi' s own), and a profile of karikaturní Kadáfího was for a long time for neuro artist topic for the sketches..
The rule that classified documents may consist only of the reports of the already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you are going to the bookstore, dedicated to ezoterické literature, you will see that each of repeated (about Graalu, mystery rennes - le - Château, templářích or freemasons, if i might) exactly what it has been written previously.
And it is not only that the author of the occult texts i searching for new information (even knows where to find the reports of the non - existent), but because those who are engaged in the occult believe only what we know and what it confirms what had already learned.
It is a mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret papers.
The informant 's lazy, and lazy (or a limited spirit), head of the secret service (and, if not, it could be, as i know, editor in the papers Libération), which it considers true only what he himself admits.
Information with high suppression of Berlusconi, which the US embassy sent to the government, the same which Newsweek published a week before.
Why, then, around the discovery of these documents do so much?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured man he knows, and that was the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since you may heads of state to call or fly the plane on common dinner, lost its diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercise in representation be transformed in Intelligence.
Any spectator watching films on investigations very well it knows that only from self - righteousness, it seemed to ignore.
Nevertheless, the fact that it was repeated publicly, decries the obligation of hypocrisy and hurled it bad light on american diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker may obtain the strictest classified information, the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, rather than a substantial, for the prestige of the national government.
The scandal affects how victims, as well as his `` U ."
But let 's get out of here to the truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell, it was possible to absorb all too, like some kind of Big Brother, who has checked every movement of its people.
Orvellovo prophecy was demonstrated, since by the ability to control every move, thanks to the phone, each of the transaction, visited Hotel, used the highway, and so on, became a citizen of the victims of power.
But, as demonstrated how it is now, that even a `` tomb "with nejtajnějšími information powerful can not resist intervention a hacker, ceases to be the control report a one - way and becomes a circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - the chosen as a citizen of the Avenger - may know all the secrets of power.
How can he hold power, which has no chance to keep their own secret?
It is true that the already Georg Simmel said that the true secret is bezobsažné secret (and bezobsažné secrets it could never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the nature of Berlusconi 's or Merkel is really mysterious bezobsažným secret, because it is drawn from public life; but to detect, just as it did WikiLeaks, that the mystery Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými secrets, means withdraw him all power.
WikiLeaks did not do any mistake in Sarkozy 's or Merkel, but it did something big Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow bestowed upon the powers so significant?
It is clear that, in the future, states will not be able to send the on - line of sensitive information - it would be tantamount to its disclosure on a poster taped on the corner of the street.
But it is also clear that the current technology is unnecessary hope that can be sustained in undercover reports on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to determine if and when the head of state travelling by air and joined with some of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the classification of private and sensitive news?
Well, i know that, for the moment has forecast belongs to the science - fiction, and it is therefore a fantastic, but i have to imagine the government officials, who shall be transported discreetly carrying out formalities after uncontrollable routes and carrying around only those reports that they know from memory, or rather hiding rare information in his shoes.
Information is retained in a unique copies in drawers concluded the key: the whole, an attempt to espionage in the case of the Watergate had a little success than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways ahead, it means backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the roads, Internet rehabilitating telegraph, based on the wires (telephone).
Video (analogue) to allow for lovers of a movie film scanning step by step, push it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CD (digital) allow only jumping on chapters, that is, after makroporcích.
Through the high - speed train will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the air travel and transport, which includes the need for three and a half hours.
It is thus exceptional that politics and communications technology will return to the wagons towed horses.
The last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had in secret embassy.
Now they are embassy, which are confidential information from the press.
The climate is: how France hackla their promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to check compliance with promises to quickly odblokovaná financing (which financing with Quick Start (fast start) or premature), followed by the developed countries.
And the French hacky were disclosed
In the Copenhagen Agreement developed countries committed to provide 30 billion in 2010 - 2012.
The European Union has promised 7,2 billion for three years, and France, 26 1 billion (that is, 420 million per year).
At the start of the COP 16 pulled out of the EU 's big ace, to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to the financing of fast start: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, Grand side - by - side refrigerators event, distribute pamphlets...
Transparent operation invaluable and priced at their real value: the advanced countries and civil society, that 's all the advanced countries and civil society amounted to the same, and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 €2,2 billion, making it brings on the right path to comply with its promise of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we will find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are under the Copenhagen agreement `` new and additional "to ensure that is increased burden implemented, without having to the detriment of public support for the development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what it means `` a new and additional ."
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, among others, and France, the process of blocked.
Today, each picks the reference, which fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, considered the reference year 2009: the international finance, too, and she still adds 150 million to three years of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen a similar References with annual payment deadlines or with terms at the level of public support for the development.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of `` all new projects "by 2010 are `` new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure for the previous period, or to the global level of public support for the development of the d 'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of aid, France to countries in the developing may remain unchanged (or even decrease), has complied with its obligation relating to the financing of the `` new and additional ."
Next, a crucial element is the division of the grants and loans.
There, there is no rule and everyone will choose their own method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that, 1 €loaned amount to €1 minute.
Obviously, it 's hard to demonstrable: the effort is not equivalent.
If the application of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments, which are profitable (often on projects related to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro, which will, as the equivalent of one of the euro, which we..., we should not be seen by virtue of their obligations, but as the cost of borrowing for the creditor country (i. e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France may submit only such reasons: `` the "its commitment of 420 million, makes that 91,5% of the loan (389,8 million) and 8 5% of the gifts (36,1 million) - see the EU to allow themselves to verify.
It is the only country of the Union, which on such a scale uses a loan.
Germany was required 46%, while the Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) comply with their obligations to 100% of the gifts.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union to €1 to the satisfaction of his promise, France can only 10 centimes and considers this effort for a comparable.
A beautiful kejklířský piece!
In summary, in its financing of `` fast start "France is operating with dual šejdířstvím: on the one hand, with the development of the shares in time, and on the other side with the real financial burden.
Although spends only 36,1 million, can be convinced that the issue of 420 million `` new and additional "in connection with their promises.
The manipulation of Finance Minister (because it seems that, although it 's Bercy, who was such a decision) would have the double negative impact, at the same time, within the EU (why the Member States continue donation, if only to borrow?) and in negotiations, because the developing countries are not entirely.
CHAPTER early financing is only a small otázečkou, a relatively short - term, in relation to a series of discussions on climate.
But it could be a grain of sand, moreover, in the enormous machine, which is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
Whether anything, it is necessary to draw the knowledge of this first year of the early financing.
Soon should France to announce a change in my way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in compliance with their obligations and decency and justice to the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should avoid debate on deposits in the long - term financing (other crucial chapter currently under consideration): will the issue of `` the additionality "or on the posting loans.
France should change its position in order to become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as it is for the other.
All hope is inserted into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko - Morizetové, which is coming to Cancun next week.
Surprising announcement of fast launch of France and its vision of `` the additionality "and the use of loans could give rise to an increase in the level of international confidence, to the necessary in order to be able to go in discussions.
The alarm pesticides, which children engulfed.
Ten - year - old child will devour one day 81 various chemicals, according to a study published this center, from the Association of future generations (ex - movement, and the maintenance of future generations).
The association, which points out that the results of the `` do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the pending issues, "i bought between July and September food commonly consumed by in four meals and a slight food as a light lunch for one child roughly ten - year in supermarkets in L 'of Oise and in Paris.
The typical food, including the official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analysed research laboratories to chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminating agents.
The balance of the plates is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 ranks among the carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as much as 37 substances, which could act as a troublesome for glands with the internal secretions (PE), according to the studies several institutions, such as the International Centre for cancer research.
`` Even if in almost all cases, legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research okay, we see that reality in consumer exposure kontaminujícím carcinogenic substances, perhaps, and / or PE is astonishing, "the association.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk containing themselves about ten résiduí to possible carcinogenic effects and three identified as a carcinogen, as in the case of about twenty residues, which could distort hormonal system.
An apple, imported from Brazil, studies referred to as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, inter alia, in France banned fungicidal resource.
The same applies to the Green beans from Kenyi, covered by lunchtime, for which the study found traces of strong insecticides banned within the EU.
Moreover, the steak from minced meat, tuna in a can, and even the bread and gum were punctuated with pesticides, and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap analysis has revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Salmon Steak for dinner was `` the richest "with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even analysis of plastic plates used for heating food in the microwave to be analysis.
The final risk for the consumer of this `` Cocktail contaminants "is likely to be underestimated," resulting from the study.
The ecological Europe - green (EE, LV) proposed `` in the face of an emergency situation "to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop, `` the increase of civilization diseases."
In July, the study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of the presence of residues 365 different pesticide identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of the 76 in cereáliích.
