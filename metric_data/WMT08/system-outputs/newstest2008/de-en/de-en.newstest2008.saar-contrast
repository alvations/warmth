Food at a European inflation
Main reason for the increase measured in the euro zone of the inflation are the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was higher in November than expected - after the 2.6 per cent in October was an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent, registered as the statistical office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports.
Official forecasts are of only 3 percent, Bloomberg announced.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Central Bank has the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower. After their discretion the cut in interest rates would the rising raw material prices and the slight drop of the unemployment, the emergence of a spiral.
The ECB is anxious, the inflation rate under two percent, or at least just at the. To hold
The ECB is according to an analyst in the dilemma: one must "arrange" the inflation in order to exclude later action need.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached in November in Germany; a twelve in Spain, the rate of 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Responsible for the rise of the inflation in the euro zone the increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF rose about 88 percent, and the course for soybeans also achieved a record high since 1973.
Also in the case of edible oil and milk products, there was a considerable increase in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose in this year about 52 percent - in the past month, reached the price per barrel of black gold almost 100 U.S. dollars.
According to the ECB the inflation will in the year 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent rise, though one counts in 2009 with a drop on 1.9 percent.
For the next 3-4 months analysts start out from a number the annual, however, with 2.1 percent.
For 2008 experts expect that the ECB will lower the interest twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnating the number of the grown considerably by the beginning of December. First time since 2002, the party has the largest base, while the agreement for the Socialists, according to a Gallup never unprecedented low of 13 percent. Has achieved
In the case of the party faithful voters the difference turns owing to the high determination of the clearly from: more than two thirds (71 percent), stand a fifth (20 percent) agreement for the mszp.
MDF and szdsz lie according to the survey under the parliamentary hurdle: they come in the total population on two percent.
The number of the is in two warehouses around a percent. Grown
In comparison with the last low the general economic atmosphere has worsened -- was never before the portion of those, the economic situation of the country as "really bad", judge so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent of them holding for "quite bad".
According to prospects in the spring and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation once again more pessimistic.
For the coming year the majority of the population counts with a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth of matter from a recovery.
A survey carried out in December showed that 71% of the respondent -- a historical high - the work of the Prime Minister as "rather badly as quite" judged.
Thirteen percent of the interviewees have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the advocates for Viktor. Comprises 38 per cent
About 54% trust the head of government, not at all, compared with 27% of distrust of the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of the ones who think one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister also without changes of government in the grip.
Had themselves after the disturbances in last October, still 35% for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government had expressed, this part amounts today only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent), sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the plebiscite 60 percent answered that they participate "with security", and another 20% of their vote "probably" would hand.
For the comparison: if the parliamentary elections on this Sunday, only 55 percent, would "certainly" go to the urns, further 15% hold their participation for "probable". In view of these trends, the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable.
74% would be against the tuition fees, 79% against the charge and 84% against the vote.
Put down on the group at the plebiscite "certainly" participation became the portions of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees even 81, 84, or 89 percent are.
Cut at the most expensive, Tesco increases by nearly a fifth
The hypermarkets in also have this year the average increase in prices of 16% of the last year, with the difference that it this year no increase in the value-added tax.
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaörser has the price of the usual Christmas of the "napi" also this year by 16 percent, though has increased in all were price increases of over 1,000 hooves. Registered
After the prices in the food markets in last December, "have", the price increase hasn't turned out drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier level.
However, it has an effect on the consumers certainly deterring that that, for which they last year still far under 9.000 had paid this year not even available for 10,000. Is
The price of the "napi" shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof in the investigated markets.
The highest price amounted to 10,573 hoof.
(in 6800 the price was at 6800.)
The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level, have increased strongly, on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with auchan gave it, however, for 139 forint.
There was no at the product on limited price slump with under 200 forint.
Here was surprising the price two litres of a Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 forint, therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257.
Nevertheless performed this year in the "napi" cut at the most expensive, and cora at came off.
Our calculations showed that the prices in the "napi" shopping basket opposite the Christmas in the past year about 15, while Tesco and auchan respectively increased about 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year amounted to 12%, while the rise between the shopping basket of the past year and of the current year constituted 21%.
The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 hoof.
The average price increase still was in the previous year at forint, however, the added value tax increase at the prices to last Christmas. Manifested
Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly: apparently the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they shall use at the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on the consumption were unforeseeable.
(if the vendor the circulation speed of a product badly plans, he can fall about essential profits in the price margin, according to the traffic intensity.)
The price increase of the "napi" turned out in the last year so radically that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 around 1720 exceeded, whereas the price difference was merely 844 forint at the cheapest basket. Amounted to
Such extremes were not observed this year, since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a rise in prices of forint.
In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed itself a disastrous price increase, the price of the daily consumer items in the hypermarkets in less than 20 months around more than 30 percent. Increased
(This in turn confirms not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months, a more than a price increase.
So in about next to flour also with eggs.)
If one takes, however, a look into the "napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already in the previous year the product even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent.
Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position than the egg -- after all, they could the drastic increase in prices on the multinationals. Pass
In the golden complain the hypermarkets do not; it is reported constantly of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.
It from all large quantities are bought, durable food go into pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless queues with the cash, as the number of the customers suddenly exploded.
However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported, so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and indeed not only in the case of food, but also with lasting materials.
In many places at disinfectants
This year more than one thousand infections in hospitals were registered, the due to inappropriate handling antibiotics. Were
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overflow of the beds, the overload of the personnel -- all factors, the the embankment of the infections not good at all, so are the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center.
In many places also with the disinfectants.
In the traumatology-department of the to hospital recently an mrsa infection was diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital. One was
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, a little later had the man, however, with a mrsa infection to return. An important operation could since then because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient, not yet to be carried out.
Until December 10th this year were from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center,. Karolina
So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security, but the true figure might be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were by the mrsa, the staphylococcus aureus resistant staphylococcus aureus. Triggered
The staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium contributes about a third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause an illness.
SA limited infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The means are however measured out too high or used inappropriately, arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant, the under appropriate conditions in the hospitals. Spreads fast
In particular with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune systems, but also in older, or patients with a low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, such as infection or blood poisoning, thus sepsis.
The medical director of the to hospital, according to the mrsa infection is nothing special, such occurrences. Belongs to the
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, tibor nyulasi - there is not only there, where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - so.
With their admission into the hospital will the patients examined, nevertheless an infection can always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by mrsa would be avoidable, however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the origin or the spreading of the virus, says.
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should investigate and mrsa immediately isolate.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised, however, so frequently.
Last but not least because it on the part of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation.
The most cases would come to light before then, if the patient has already a noticeable has, so the medical head of the epidemiology Center.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are, however, also in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be, this means microbiological examinations are necessary, so that no resistance can form against the means, however this directive of hospitals are also not always kept.
Under the ambulatory, or in the basic supply the patient microbiological sampling are even still rarer, so. Karolina
One saves with the disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that mrsa from a patient on the other the most frequently by the nursing staff will transfer.
Just therefore the manual washing, or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance, however, there are also on this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.
Mrsa is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the local hospitals, however, There isn't always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds connected barely although it between them from the epidemiological view, a distance of at least 1.5 meters. That should give
Like karolina keeps on saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even that with disinfectants is saved, it gives few nurses, many patients - all factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there and / or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are adhered to, so. Karolina
Government program against mrsa
In the mrsa grip to get the causes Health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England for example, the prevention of mrsa, and / or their containment was held in the government program.
After first signs the program successfully -- as published data prove, the tendency of the declining in England.
The European Center for disease prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the emergence of viruses (under that also mrsa), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.

Bulgaria, the EU, the
The development of the Bulgarian property market is splendid -- the whole of Europe looks the Balkan state seldom mentioned earlier.
What, where, and who buys at the still the cheapest market of the European Union, the more expensive wildly? will
An analysis of the Bulgarian re / Max division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the plaster for real estate purchases in the East European room, with favorable ski apartments and houses at the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions bansko, borovec, pamprovo and, too, the most popular, at the sea albena, the "Coast", the "", and the historical the sozopol and, though, rather than a real estates are all around kavarna and balcik also ever more. Asked
According to estimates of re. Analysts in Bulgaria also the inland sooner or later attract investors, so for example veliko tarnovo, and triavna, and also the distinctly favorable area of records more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers enticing offers -- trade and office space offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way of one of the most attractive European to become, and thus next to the summer and winter also in the other two seasons. To attract tourists
Foresighted investors buy therefore already now in great style, for example about bansko.
According to analysts, strive people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria, also a change of their way of life.
Most buyers are English, it prospects however also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and ever more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while it with the Black Sea and in the skiing predominantly Russian buyers gives.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, say regional director of re. Bulgaria.
Those which want to sit down to buy either real estate by 50-100,000 euros or shabby houses around 5-15.000 euro, which they then.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are written, but also the proximity to a city, businesses and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
To the second category, who on the search of a vacation are (of Bulgaria was in December under the top ten vacation aims of the Germans listed).
Businessmen constitute the third group, which with the objective of a medium- to long-term accretion invest.
Real estate in the capital are constantly more expensive, necessitated by the always growing demand.
Within the European Union are the lowest in Bulgaria, in the past five years, however, there was a price increase by every year 21 per cent.
The price increase at the real estate prices exceeds by far the rise of the salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Secretary of the announced, the expert meetings on Tuesday to end, and the debate about the international after 2012 is by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening. Continued
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the schedule of Bali, in which the measures for the period after 2012, thus after the Kyoto protocols are fixed.
At present, an intense debate is in operation between industrial and developing countries.
Already have the USA that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, though they would be ready until the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 by 25-40 percent. To reduce
The other large question of the conference is whether the industrial nations are ready, in addition to the reduction of the issues the developing countries both financially, than to support also technologically.
It was also an agreement over the support of developing countries. Obtained
This put the Kyoto Protocol fund shall be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, most likely at the Global Environment Facility (gef) of the UN, as in the "piac profit" is to be read.
Hungary's six percent
Secretary of the supports in the name of Hungary the effort of the European Union, its pioneering role at global, and keeping up a new international agreement to 2009. To achieve
The Minister explained, the EU will the until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions by 20% theoretically (measured against the values of 1990), independently of whether the "agreement successfully obtained after 2012", or not. The Union would be even ready to for a reduction, other great industrial nations of the world, or developing countries are also ready to, their obligations according to strengths and responsibly.
Of the emphasized that the objective of the States, which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, a reduction of only 5.2 percent was whereas the EU with their then 15 Member States already to a minus of 8% had obliged.
The guideline for Hungary says reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years - a default, which will quite fulfill the country, such as in the press release of the Ministry of the environment is to be read.
The employment is high on Bali - in any case must the long-term international agreement be finished within two years, otherwise it would certainly first after 2012 come into force. In this case the would defined in the Kyoto Protocol No renewed, international consequences, whose importance also the IPCC, the international distinguished with the Nobel Peace Prize a scientific committee of the UN in its recent report has stressed.
By this means that the emission reduction would be delayed, and the increase of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which is extremely serious and irreparable consequences according the consequence. That would have

Confirm
Americans advertise with game
However, the army also must fight against which it beside the carefully worked on, to zensurierten photographs into the network as well - to create such as such, which show the soldiers' death: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda talks about the losses at most, the bloody sides of the war are not shown, however.
Of the theaters of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan were after all already numerous in use videos loaded on the platform, this "kind" to have the British but only recently for itself were discovered.
The Americans recruit meanwhile on the somewhat other kind, namely with the free of charge downloadable free-of-charge "America's army", in which the players in the context of a more or less simulation in the skin of the soldiers can slip.

Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department for risk analysis (risk division) of political capital the activities in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary," Hungarian guard founded the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect.
In the "risk" of the Institute of it means among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the "aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary, even at short notice could lead to violent ethnic discussions."
Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which supposedly on the provocation of such a confrontation aims, according to the research institute.
As reported, will this as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons: looked at "persons of the public life have the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political grouping, which now their political strategy on the have built up".
One suspects that this intensify the problem, the rational dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.
The forschungsinsitut means, the activities of the Hungarian guard would have, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, in particular, what the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity." affects
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several, "national self-defense association" organizations were founded.
"these groupings it is common that they each case define themselves as civilian organization, while they boast openly about their members on - sometimes armed - Defense tasks of preparing (disaster control, national Defense,), under appointment on the unsuitability of the police, the army, and / or the State itself,", it was said.
And further: that everything happens in accordance with that method, which tries, different, on the policies and of the population, based, political efforts as civil initiative. To disguise
The emphasis of the civilian character and the association therefore serve not only the evasion of legal hurdles, in the course of the registration with Court -- could emerge, it is at the same time a political strategy.
Like to be inferred from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor also for the relations with the neighboring States.
"in the last months, the Hungarian guard was in several States as a potential source of danger, quoted so many a politician of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own. Anti
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region "- it was called.
From the viewpoint of the research institute is the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not in, thus the political risk for the entire region grew.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of comparable to the Bulgarian national guard, whose foundation in August 2007 of the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu). Was announced
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the stood the riotings in a district of Sofia (krasna poljana) have taken place.
The bnu has the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization is the "national protection".
According to their opinion was indeed in the past 17 years a real "terror" marked in Bulgaria, the state however remained idle and indifferent - so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public. Kicked loose
As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to reasons.
There the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma likewise, with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats it is called in the risk of political capital.
Attila juhász, Director of research with political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Every year would be published annually and should is tendencies be recognizable, the public opinion is informed, as in the case by the publication of the risk.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly, so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days around the holidays, in the meantime, though, has established the next year grants us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America one means something else under "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.
Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or stand with important historical events in connection.
We celebrate new year as well, for example: both the last day of the old, as also the first day of the new year work-free days are - latter alone already thus the able to rest.
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state are the 15th March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and the 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work, celebrated on November 1st and 2nd, we intend our dead ones.
In addition there are ever two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "shift" worked satisfactorily in the cases, in which we before or after the holiday only a day. Would work
The price of the extended weekends is, however, that we very probably work on Saturdays before it, or must go into the school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, at long last, is supposed to be worked off, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.
The legislation is valid for all employers and recipients, for public employees and officials of the public service.
Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption, thus also at the holidays, is continued.
This year, the will still only rules by the holidays at the end of the year, somewhat confused: taken from the 24 December remains this country really stand since the most for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specifically for it waived vacation take.
In the next year, more holidays fall in the week Center, and / or on the end of the week, so that, at the working days will be less than this year.
The calendar will around the day of the work "on the head", so that the people equal four days at the piece to stay home. Can
Saturday, April 26th becomes a working day, in order that the Friday, 2 May can be a day of rest.
The second change is connected with the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, the 18th October becomes one process Friday, 24 October first must.
The end of the year will however completely in the indication of the holidays, after starting from 24 December everything remains lying and standing, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy colleagues
E-mails which we forget to send, messages, which we never receive - harmless lies, the US don't notice any more: they bring "color" in the everyday life on the job.
The question is whether one becomes accustomed to these small used, or provides one better to the challenge and attempts this misleading, for other angry situations consciously.
Tips.
"sorry, I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the marketing department called" -- a colleague says.
That one has missed a meeting through?
At best one regrets it and tries it again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less usual method).
Is usually the thing with an excuse. Dismissed
Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments, and try to avoid these situations intentionally.
Something lent, which does not belong to one?
There is hardly something sinewy as if one after a document, or the telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today? away
Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague? discovered
Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed, if they determine that something got away.
Thus, no covers or mail from the office put into the bag, because it could meet: no more there, if one's nevertheless urgently needs.
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means, a gossip, which was already put into the world. To stop
Who with whom?, which made
Where and why?
The one should information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues after possibility not every tie to the nose!
And if someone opens and his innermost secret betrays us, we should not abuse this confidence!
Best one is silent as a grave, instead of just not present to pass on, even if others about the problems of the colleague also know.
Without reason ill? reported
If one calls in the office, under reference to tormenting headache to ill, report because one just feels uneasy, or simply would only like to rest, one should himself about one: to realize the own work, urgent, projects with firm dates must now the colleagues instead of one themselves.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one knows already on the day before that one it on the next day not into the office will manage, or that something could get in the way, why one must remain at home, one should announce it in time, so that neither the colleagues, still the leader unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Hum,, giggle, telephoning
One is hollow just in his work, however, is suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues? disturbed
Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud discussions (the one leads over their heads), trample, continuing grumbling or nerves.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (write, plan, organize) recessed.
Are always the other? blame
Is a project is not ready in due time, one has an important letter or important realigns forget to send, one should not the fault of the own forgetfulness at other! search
As far as possible one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one admits his errors, and apologizes, if others were affected also by it!
The question, how one the error again, or which missed retrieve can, is only too made!
In the office - a feeling like to home?
Pants and schlapfen: comfortably for at home, but lost nothing in the office!
Not even then one should dress so casual, if it would actually permit the job!
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues, as also themselves even as far as that respect one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and traffic, the car in the middle of the all back-up.
From the radio a strange: sang the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume more highly.
The speed changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real female chorus.
It is the song "wings of love" of zagar, that on mr2.
The local music scene has us long time not just delicately with qualitative electropop.
But one sees even the back-up now differently if one hears the new album of.
The appearance of to, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture, and even if the garage with its gitarrengequit again "in" the domestic electropop proves: it gives new under the sun.
Balázs has begun in pécs, played instruments even in the band to, before he - perhaps, because a pub tolerates no two whistlers - his own way to walk on began.
The breakthrough with his project (zagar) and his music, which elements from jazz, electronics, and pop, together, but it created only as one with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film had approached him (e.g.
"szezon" of Ferenc toeroek).
The formation, which originally had appeared in smaller clubs, was known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and zagar, together with, to the almost only, also in the West marketable trendsetter.
And his band undoubtedly were "trendy", however, no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, still better album.
The now appeared new album with the title "cannot walk walk fly" could open new paths for them, however the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years.
The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs with yet another band was on the way.
The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, apart from the ethereal character of the music - the spirit of the time and the trends -- corresponding to louder guitar, the influences of the rock 'n' roll on.
With these songs of the living in England and with the band "the puzzle" working singers gyoergy ligeti with the premiere in. Introduced
A song of the album has it even for the radio hit - since the one from early to pop music late mr2 pet the listeners with the number "wings of love", which under cooperation of six local singers ("underground stars") was taken the successive set.
Everything in order thus (?).
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs.
Hvg.hu: this new hit raises the question: to what extent does your music of a certain shift? reserved for
Balázs: the term "layer music" does not mean me straight much.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in the pop music, and indeed not mainstream and underground or alternative and pop, but commercial and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground can be shallow and meaningless, exactly the same, they can also, however, only for the sale be produced, which makes it commercial music.
Also a good can arise from an honest motive.
The acceptance of the listener functions independently according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience? your music
B. zs.: abroad, particularly to the west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or on concerts, but also the older audience there.
They pursue the trends in the pop music, which happen around them, much more attentive, because they also for a part of the contemporary culture. To hold
Hvg.hu: what role comes to the audience at your work?
It is important, who, where, how much your music? hear
B. zs. Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
However, we have never for the market.
With us the music does not develop, in order to serve a purpose, but from a certain reason.
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but it gives again only in the unreachable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one struck me: you want to make it all right, you are not more interesting.
Hvg.hu: how far you like? to follow the example of
It is as a soloist on the way and has his career in the West.
B. zs. We don't really go his way, once completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again, this in our music.
We see rather than which on the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded.
Originally were naturally comparisons of our work with the of to inevitable, since several of us come from his band and have taken another way.
Hvg.hu: in the charts of mr2 pet "wings of love" stands at the first place.
Many have only in connection with this number belonged to the names.
Was the opening with a somewhat style in the direction of a wider audience? conscious
B. zs.: we had no plans to write a hit, the then as a train horse for the album. Is supposed to serve
In this song, it is a matter of more.
It was meant as final of the album, with which we, the and the somewhat more difficult topics. Wanted to dissolve
Hvg.hu: how have you? the six singers
Why just it, which was the guidance principle?
B. zs.: the basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to combine the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
So the six-headed choir arose - thus for sena, edina bori, judie jay, bori péterfy, [neo], sena, -, we then baptized that "underground stars". Have christened
Hvg.hu: you have the song exactly the same, or do have it the girls?
B. zs.: there was the number already in the longer version, but as the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something."
The chord has really asked for a singing voice.
I still have one sung the in the same night, she has learned the girls later.
It everything came virtually immediately and alarming spontaneously.
I can remember, I was then quite electrified, but it also has already needed the "stars".
With my voice alone the song would never become so strong.
Hvg.hu: both on the plate, as also at the concert, however, one had the impression, the girls would be in the background.
It gives no solo part (except for the short solo from jay), they have no own role, sings perfectly together and are not louder than the music, therefore their gesang't only accompanied by the music.
Also on the stage they stood behind.
? is it intention
B.zs.: that they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems.
However we wanted them aware no solo roles.
In the number it also is all about that one to forget his ego a little bit should forget, who from where come and where is away, we simply allow us too, that these certain wings, the wings of the love.
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition, which we have felt when the song has arisen.
Hvg.hu: which one was the most? song
B. zs.: with the musical work work actually none, it gave more difficult tasks rather when mixing.
For example in the case of "dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I play on a, or in the case of "rock 'n' roll goes to the girls", where the groove did not want to function longer, but after and little everything turned out, as in the case of a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: which is your favourite number of the new album?
B. zs.: that changes continuously with the concerts and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen".
Currently there are "prophet is a fool", "escape from the earth" and the number "seed".
Fraudulent broker risked because of feelings of inferiority billion
Bottomless swindler
So describes his former employee of the French bank giant Société Générale owner the local banka.
They came because of him around almost five billion euros.
However, it seems rather so that Générale was only a large player, who wanted to do it like his colleagues beyond that surely not was unable.
To the difference to all large banking houses it recognized in time the crisis. At the amerikanischenn mortgage
"It is psychologically rather weak," was from the mouth of his superiors to be heard, who reported it to the police.
Like however from the statements, the result, the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, published, he was a human being, at the end of last year with its business of profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euro had obtained.
Crisis not only in America
"everything I wanted was for my bank, to earn money," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed just at the American crisis to earn half a billion euro.
The opportunity in addition he had already indeed at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first messages over that so-called mortgages as they low-income customers or such, who had already in former times, are given in difficulties would be fallen.
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however.
Générale didn't believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had his profit up to 1.6 billion euro.
"already than I had earned the first half billion, I did not know, as I should explain that," admits and continue to say that he has kept nothing definitely for itself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents, so that one would not come him to the pulps.
He even succeeded to lead its bosses behind the light, even if the gradually, for eurex interested in its business.
Risk profit
Feared he to be exposed?
Probably scarcely.
"I thought, that they the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the Bank, satisfies."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
In the Société Générale it occurred in the year 2000, immediately after he his study at the University of Lyon, had ended. A
His annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars.
After two years, he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he will never earn as much as others.
"already during my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one watched me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "explained the investigator.
But already soon after its entry the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance he earned much, by setting at the London bomb attacks half a billion euro losses on exchange of this title.
And that was the trigger -- he wanted more now.
As long as you make profit, we let you
"this is like a snowball," he told the policemen.
But the bosses knew allegedly from everything, and / or suspected it.
"as long as I earned money, one closed the eyes."
But then came at the beginning of this year. The great blow
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to balance that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was already not more employees of the Bank.
And a few days later the Bank announced that it lost five billion euro on his account.
And how they came on for him? the tricks
It looked suspicious through a vacation.
"I have only four days from the previous year.
A broker, who takes no vacation is one, which does not want that one sees for him in the tickets, "said definitively.
Czechia has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday altogether nine development programs, by which the Czech Republic in the next years to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Crowns). Can come
It concerns here approximately half of the sum, the ones in the years 2007 to 2013 at all from Brussels. Can receive
About 125 billion Crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be about 100 billion Crowns from the program "enterprise and innovation" allocated. Able to get
Most money, approximately 150 billion, will flow into the traffic development.
The traffic program is the largest development program and includes up to 22 per cent of the means, the Czechia can get from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State traffic infrastructure fund, the next year 90.8 billion. Will have
The program "enterprise and innovation" shall serve businessmen and companies to win funds to innovative businesses.
The companies should win finances for the introduction of new technologies, for research, but also for the introduction of more effective organization methods.
With the previous aquisition from EU funds, belongs among the new countries to the up to now least successful.
Nicaraguan Court confirms twenty prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty prison sentence for the former President Arnold Alemán, to which he 2003 because of deceit in the amount of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion Crowns) had been sentenced.
Later, however, he had been released from the prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes behind bars again is currently unclear according to the news agency.
The chairman of the Court of Appeal, ileana Pérez, according to it will from now depend on the, whether one lets Alemán its punishment serve at home, or whether it must in the prison.
Four years ago, a Court proved that regularly money the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama. Had shifted
These companies were fictitious and in reality the accounts belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Percent of this money finally landed in a fund for financing its election campaign 2001 had established.
Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government has designed and without the support of the opposition by the coalition was accepted.
For the current year was still with support of the cssd (social democrats), approved because it Minister sobotka (of this party) had submitted, and the cssd could not allow it therefore rejecting him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliament approved this traditionally few paid attention to, nevertheless highly important law in all peace.
This is to a certain extent paradoxical.
Rules over everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes this or not.
The budget is an essential component of the politics, however, is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
That is for the media a more grateful topic, and therefore they devote more attention to him.
A controversy among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered at the past social democratic governments under three weak points, which the budget for the year 2008 not on once: can eliminate
The first is the high share of expenditure because of law obliging, at which it is not only about the pensions, but also about social expenditures, which the "silent" coalition of cssd and ksm (Communists) in the last year before the elections has concluded.
The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the local authorities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and one javelin measures under control.
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the local authorities.
Many mayors spent, about except incomes from taxes, taxes and bank credits further sources for investments, often mostly from bonds, by which they caused their city halls in the excess.
In the last years, they succeeded, these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks, the them in the train had received from the State to pay off.
Now is this source already dried up.
As far as we ourselves only at official and verifiable facts, we notice that:
Our economy for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth through, whose the cssd incessantly himself boasts.
This represented a unique possibility for their governments to take public finances into order.
Instead these governments were to blame for the state, however, still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries, which, in the global scale, seen at the least of poverty are threatened.
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary, which unfortunately just in the last few years quite in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if it is successful, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures, which were adopted this year before the elections, to paint, is clear, that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension reform comes, then virtually any politics in this country, and, very now who is in power, he will not have anything as a pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated, if one says that then from ruling politicians officials become, the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically up on pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by duty areas.
The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments in the last ten years would have not distributed, which only went.
If we don't want that it really comes to that from ruling politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte become, then we must be patient and this is not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious that the state can spend only so much, as it is at taxes and fees to take in the situation is quiet at the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these make a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together against the crisis on the financial markets to fight.
So more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions on the currency markets.
On these auctions, the banks auction of interest rates, to which they are ready to lend each other money.
For example the American fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, further 24 makes it for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is after the assaults of the, is the first time that the central banks of the individual States agree on such a coordinated procedure for the defense and / or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis.
"this step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, thus the increasing lack of freely available capital, which the banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard pool of the consultancy firm economic outlook group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of a recession in the USA of 65% on about 50%," added in his report.
The banks have because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars, primarily in the United States.
Analysts expect still further losses.
"" the central banks really must have been afraid of it, which still everything can follow, when to this procedure decided, "said the economist of ABN AMRO, kieran Davies.
"It appears that the situation is really bad," he further said.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have access to loans, credits even more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce the consumption and the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the growth in the whole world.
The central banks have decided, after they had not succeeded, the so-called libor, lower the rate of the used with the moneylending between banks.
This means that the banks had constantly fear, to lend each other money and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.
"this will have the same effect as a further lowering of the interest rates," said Greg salvaggio of tense consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts are of the opinion that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and indeed the case of the property market in the USA.
Klaus: debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes damage allegedly developing countries at most.
President Václav Klaus expressed itself again the problematic nature of the global warming.
The criticism referred now the on going to end international conference of the UN for the climate change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he his book "a blue, no Green planet", presented from he executed, that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus is not only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it, and the reality.
"the debate there is unstructured, it is some word fireworks only replacement is for a real solution of current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized at the presentation of his book that the subject is very important for him and that therefore he commits himself to it so.
He also expressed his satisfaction over the fact that its book published in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my opinions."
Now business prospects could therefore read its setting.
Klaus reminded that it was not klimatologe, but he changed his opinion after sufficient requirements in order to write such a book.
He is finally academics, able to understand professional discussions and to judge, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As a main statement of the book he described the thesis that the climate changed continuously and that his changes are therefore normal that there no for the global warming concurring opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and, therefore, no threat represented, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, redundant, ineffective expensive and.
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian, unacceptable, to other unproven views upon, he regards that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.
On questions of present explained it repeated, he is not against "a sensible environmental protection, but against ecological activists who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and return."
About the same topic Klaus in Vienna had already two months ago. In Hayek

Polívka came about its Kingdom move
Bolek polívka lost the controversy around the brand "kingdom." move
The judge at the district court in Ostrava according to it as the first used the name "walachischer King", but the project had a team in work of many years around Tomás harabi in cooperation with the actor.
Today, polívka didn't take part in the negotiation.
According to his attorney the thing is not thus however probably ended and his client will probably lodge an appeal.
"the argument goes around the fact that Mr. harabi and his team at the popularity bolek polívkas want to participate," said after the negotiation advocate.
All imagined with the words "walachi Kingdom" straight this actor and comedian.
Also is of the same opinion.
"We have an almost ten years' work behind us.
Fund-raising and drafts of the activities, "he said.
According to him, the cause is controversy over money.
"after years they have noticed that the project is successful and that they also could have something of this.
You want to win at our work, "he further said.
Lucrative business
According to the Court used the name "walachischer King" for the first time in one of its television broadcasts.
1993 crowned him, the actor.
However, this wasn't at that time, with the intention of together to justify a fictitious Kingdom.
Came some years later? on the thought of distributing walachische passports.
From an originally funny action a business and a business activity crystallized, at the foundation of the company then "walachi Kingdom" attached.
In 1997 polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and offered their owners even reductions during the visit of his farm and its theater presentation.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that harabi used only the bare idea which publicly in the shipment of "ring" for its business intentions. Has made
"The popularity polívkas has the project of the walachischen Kingdom reliably," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project? and his team are, which would have devoted themselves to him intensively.
The cooperation of the today quarrelling parties lasted up to the year 2000, as for in organized the official coronation.
Since then, however, began to accumulate between polívka and to accumulate the quarrels, which culminated in the "King boleslavs I. chosen up to the sinking never flax day".
The leading role then took on as a Queen Mother in. Up
2002, then handed against harabi and his company the complaint, which rejected the Court today.
Clarity in the controversy could prepared by match around the throne and half a princess.
A new King should result from it.
Details and a date. He did not yet want to betray
"We want to nothing.
It should be something like that as the move in the.
The King should be elected for a particular time.
Mr polívka also can make an appointment quietly, "added.
Test Peugeot 207 sw: voruteile fades
In order to say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling characteristics were not much value, the quality of the gear shift, the guidance and also the processing could one as rather designate below average.
Now but his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this is about much better.
The combination with the designation sw is still a piece of further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to me, for example about the too small on the rear seats.
There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.
Quickly further
I go through only shortly, in order not to repeat me too much.
It is a quite excellent design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and are the times past, where perhaps we complained about to short seats or head restraints.
Also the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.
What the room supply concerns here as well, one can feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon is also the already mentioned lack of, is eliminated.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main point at this car is, however, the cargo hold.
I must (also because of the reverse window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with safety belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
You do not disturb, make itself and hold even more difficult objects.
But let's talk about the case volume.
It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which in the comparison to the competition is a rather average value.
Though not in comparison to the vehicle of this class, the Skoda fabia combi.
If we the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, compares we determine that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical.
But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must still the loading space completely flat after turning the cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge.
120 PS in four rows
With our test car was with a four-cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 KW. Equipped
And honestly said, so should have a look, which propels a family.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda, which sometimes works, as would be its exhaust with a rag clogged, then I can only be inspired by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
However, we must remember that we are a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still concerns.
With our engine it costs as 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment quality of the test beats still once with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
We had however bags, automatic air conditioning system, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, but you calculate once the additional equipment fabia together and they will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore only remains the decision, which mark one wants to choose.
Integration of Slovakian pupils at britschen schools does not succeed
At British schools the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe, which in the case of the native fears about the further development of the local education.
The integration of the east Europeans pushes to date on a number of obstacles.
British schools determine even cases, where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants at violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to britschen schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where the arguments between the natives and Slovakian immigrants increase gradually.
Quarrels, harassment and fights among pupils have on the relationships between the parents.

Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals described the quarrel with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as survival fight.

Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of the freedom.
What you always expect of your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you select only the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters, the pizza, ice at the beach and beguiling cocktails. Offer
Kitesurfing, Gulf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you find that in measure.
Only on an island you find however still much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the big Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the capture of America.
It called Columbus the most beautiful place which has seen per a human eye.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures, the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The hotel Nacional originated in completely at the end of the 20th century.
Build it left to one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything what applied in the USA as crime (particularly during the prohibition) was seen with pleasure on Cuba and supports - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among other things.
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high-rise buildings increased over the broad boulevards, the cars, drove to the cult symbols of the fifties of the ritual. Among
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula, in the closeness in and he had his yacht lie.
On the walls of the bodeguita del Medio star of the show business and politicians from the whole of America. Their signatures
? and today
On the walls of the bodeguita of Havana also you can leave your autograph.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional, one for them after cocktails very desire.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today because the imported once and Fiat in salty and damp air fell apart a long time ago.
Likes to Havana, in particular its oldest part, heavily, anywhere finds one in the periphery so many colonial objects of interest here as straight.
Other places are just decorated, for example, Trinidad.
In regard to it that the tourism brings urgently needed money, it gave it for this development green light.
In the last fifteen years not only in Havana new hotels developed, but also in varadero, at the coast of the province holguín and also on islets as cayo Coco, cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique on the world and above all railway lover.
Of steam narrow plantations and took the sugar to the sugar factories.
Her car fleet was not renewed over decades, and so one sees there funny and fully functioning locomotives, whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum.
Excursion destinations
The places, can be the majority of the visitors from Cuba does not.
So one must about varadero or Havana not more in detail. Write
It only remains to mention that in the estate of Hemingway already mentioned a museum, whose visit that one, which likes this writer. Shouldn't miss
The viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The luxuriant vegetation grows on chalky soil.
The mogotas, lime hill and rocks tower steeply from the valley on, in their hollow accumulated fertile soil, by the also weathered are covered by a thick vegetation are covered accumulated.
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco cultivated.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories.
Possibly it appears some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series "major Zeman" was turned.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which briefly after the Spaniards had colonized the island. Was founded
Fame and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the trim beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, between the sea and the escambray, sited, is such a remote place that there was still in the fifties of the last century was no road, the area with the remaining country. Would have combined
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built, but even nothing therefore torn off, each was glad that he had a roof over the head.
If one for Trinidad more than an afternoon time has, then, it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment such as the beach playa ancón or the "valley of the factories".
At the evening one should then in the Casa de la go, according to the darkness, and where the music not silent up to the morning.
Baracoa
This small town completely in the East of Cuba some describe as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this opinion affected also by the way there.
Both roads, the lead from Guantánamo there, must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape, which is hardly touched by human interventions high.
This Eastern outpost of Cuba took the UNESCO thanks to the nonlocal pristine nature in her heir on.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church, one shows the Cross of Columbus (in reality, it is about a hundred years arisen after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, stands, are several board to see, of which El yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, which Sierra, the Bay and the island of Isla de pinos, about the, the heiligtum of the Cuban patron caridad del cobre, about the santeria, an African religion, to which the descendants of slaves confess, over all that could write one many pages.
However, as one says so: looking better with own eyes.

According to the United States are the allies but at an absolute border, which concerns organization and equipment of the units.

However, you are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of force gives and the not so high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said gates.
The British tabloid "sun" described the German soldiers as lazybones this week.
"Afghan idlers exposed: the Germans make plays, while our boy fights," wrote the "sun" in a contribution, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers, the table tennis play.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit with a in the southern part of Afghanistan.

This amount is primarily due to the state budget deficit which 76 billion Crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion. Will reach

After indicating their attorney, the British teacher, the in Sudan, been accused of insult of the Islam, was on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days of detention and subsequent classification.
The Briton was accused of six to seven-year students to have permitted a bear the name Mahomet to give, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
They would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils repeatedly with the Sudanese Ministry of Education had complained to the was education and cultural, the at the high school from Khartoum, was active on Sunday with themselves at home and picked up after Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the offense of the Islam.

In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September, when the teacher their pupils six to seven year to choose a name for the class Teddy.
"The children suggest eight name before Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, under" principal Robert reports. Boules
Finally, when the class votes from 20 to select 23 children Mohammed as the kindest first names.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all also a first name very frequent in Sudan.
Then the children a book for the class, with the photo of the bear after that and the caption "my name is Mohammed".
The bear did not carry a label with this name, but the problem is quite simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult of the Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, at the same school teaches in Sudan, explained, he knows it well, and she would never something would have done, with what they could get a religious faith too near, "I only regret that it has asked the children, for a name to vote", its judgement concerns it here only a "innocent error".
An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher share the this as "very attentively opposite their pupils" and as a "person, who never talks about religion in the class. Describing
One considers that the first name of Mohammed is simultaneously as well as the second most frequent on in Great Britain given second is, for the 14 different notations exist in English.
This first name often selected by Moslem families is regarded as a kind of respect to the prophet (he is frequently the given a family).
But how do the rules in the reference to the use of this first name?
One may give a toy him for example?
This is of course a question of the interpretation.

The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, it will at the counting of the urns: 't get the mass of the Russians for President Putin's party, United Russia, decide.

He does this in his quality as candidate of the United Russia, the, for which an overwhelming victory announces itself.

"the Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much leading: questions on
? who will succeed as President? begin
The office has yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections announced, the 2nd March 2008; the candidates have time until December 23rd to known. To make
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin not for a third mandate in sequence.
And now, no successor is found.
What role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority in Parliament and the all-powerful party United Russia, the government and President? will select
Whatever it will be, in the case of the Parliament or with the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
"the Russians have the mentality of the Homo sovieticus, they are not master of their fate", mean the sociologist lev director of the independent Center levada.
The historians' Nikolai of the St. Petersburg State University even still goes back further: the civil society has itself in this country, the five centuries to Europe, was only very slowly; the famous esprit de corps has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin has again to the model of a paternalistic state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more since no terror followed on this new paternalism, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria lipman means of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians renounce "voluntarily with the personal responsibility", which they after the disintegration of the USSR briefly on the day. Have laid
"which still for a long time?"
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business community.
And the administration understands it to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian region chairmen) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
The freedoms new, coming from the West are often tantamount to chaos, as in the nineties.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old Professor: "which still consider for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why they replace? "

The study was with the help of a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were in the last issue of the science magazine published.
According to statement Bernd of Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn research Centers of the life & brain, "the activation was strongest if the participants gave correct answers and its fellow player failed However."

Which insurance is suitable for me on? the best
The motor vehicle insurance which a possible claim caused by the driver, covers contains a high cost, whose height of depends on various factors, among other things of age, sex, time of the preparation of the driving licence, family status, kind of the cars to be insured and its use, etc
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the correct vehicle model.
First of all it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is in writing by means of an versicherungsvertrags were recorded, which specifies that the society receives, and in exchange is engaged with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation.
The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors, among others age, sex, time of the preparation of the driving licence, family status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance set their prices according to the statistics, so that with a more severe danger of accident also higher payments are due.
For this reason both via women less contribution payments achieve, because statistics prove that these groups thanks to their caution. Show a smaller accident rate
The same also applies to married people, since this according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises, to fewer accidents tend as singles.
The use, which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more probable the damage.
With the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points.
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance, the most likely approaches his personal needs.
We list at this place is now the most important points, the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account, in order not only a power-, but also a choice oriented. To be able to meet
Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles, such as the small driving practice and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover would be the best to sign a full, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with, so that the achievements of an indeed fully covered, but offered at a low price.
This kind of contract includes that the customer a part of the amount that resulted by the damage himself. Must pay
"the amount will before conclusion of the contract and based on the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly ever smaller the sum", explains Luis Noguera, main agent of Spain with Europe, for a mediation. On-line
Another option is the extended insurance, the the customer against external damages, not however against the harm arisen at the own car.
In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here. A Council
If you are under 25 years old, it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the corresponding insurance company.
In the opposite for this purpose a payment a rise of said rate.
"the height of credits and punishing payments hang from the society and their returns.
If the enterprise has a rich year behind it, can permit itself to increase the bonus ", explains.
As soon as the 25-year exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to sign a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving the accident rate sinks.
Thus, it is the most sensible for a full comprehensive insurance with. To decide
"normally the young people can not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident than also at the time of the driving not", describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur, after the "fear of the beginner" was put down.
Nevertheless, it is the case of a married customer, doesn't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance; naturally only then, if it the financial situation of the appropriate person. Also allows
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low as well from its payments.
In this case would be a full comprehensive insurance with (at an amount by the 300 Euros) the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, has recommended an extended insurance, the first to the third shows commitment.
"they travel altogether more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which permits it to them, a higher payment of dues to set", determine Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it offers itself, with a full hull (at an amount by the 150 euros), or an extended insurance, to conclude, the only at a sufficiently high credit.
Finally one must observe that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because they high costs, which require it, that a thorough selection is met, which corresponds to our personal situation.

New fears over natural gas controversy between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price quarrel between the Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe.
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is conducted by the Ukraine and every argument between the two nations is watched very exactly.
Kiev has warned that if the Moscow the price that it must pay for the natural gas increases, it from Russia higher transit charges into account will put.
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies in the European Union states.
The latest quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happened at a time, to which the Ukrainian Government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it, how much the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in the year 2008. Must pay
According to Gazprom, more must be charged to the Ukraine, since the company agreed up to 50% for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan to pay.
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine 40% more for the imports of Gazprom. Must pay
"It is important for us, our arguments as one of the most important in the case of conversations to use", said the Minister of economics of the Ukraine of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should certainly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine."
In the last large natural between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries in the Ukraine.
This led in consequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed the prices in the height.
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.

It reports that the militants would have planned to smuggle in eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Further 22 of the prisoners planned according to the report, to kill priests and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen more to do in order to stop Saudis, who strive for Iraq around itself with Al Qaida militias who, the allied forces and the Shiite Muslim government the of the want to fight under the Sunni Saudis as heretical is looked.
To consider Al Qaida militias many priests in Saudi Arabia as in cooperation with the authorities in the support of the policy of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls of Osama Bin Laden, the born in Saudi Arabia, Al Qaida leader it on the pro-Western Saudi government - aim it on foreign residential areas, government buildings and installations of the energy sector.
"this was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months", divided, a spokesman of the Department of the Interior with the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "cell" of 16 from Medina, it aimed at, for the "takfiri thinking" to recruit - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims that violence against Muslims as the supports doubting and disloyal apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people, which were accused of the militias financial support to have made available.
The climate on the Venus could a view on the future of the earth reveal
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place to the life, scientists said yesterday.
Data of a European situated on an orbit show that of the planet a averted twin of the earth still more, resembles than so far was conscious.
The Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary of the earth.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is a little nearer.
Front of billions of years on the Venus conditions would have prevailed, the very similar to those on the earth would have been and would have been able to even be habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation suggested the Venus a quite different. A
The planet is robbed by water today and has a surface temperature, which is hot enough, lead to melt and by winds and lightning storms. Devastated
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express the European space travel agency, which planned for a year has examined, offer a view of how the earth in view of the disastrous climate changes could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus express mission, said: "it becomes clear why the climate on the Venus so different to that of the earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar to themselves."
"our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus before billions of years began like the earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports of enriched uranium, was yesterday of the Slovakian and Hungarian police. Confiscated
A speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material is examined.
He did not confirm whether it is a question of enriched uranium, but said that it is for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds) sold could.
Everything still open
Mitt romey said, it did not keep it, worthy of a presidential candidate to be consulted from a snowman.
Nevertheless declared itself the Republican candidate for the Presidency, in the long run ready to place itself to a debate on, in the normal voters on video take and submit questions, in order to send it to the candidate.
None of the questions, which on Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, were so ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats' about the global warming in the the debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party which opens bursts in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly as the producers of CNN, which the debate, the selected the candidates to clips. Clip
However in the first half hour of the debate, the longest the a single topic was dedicated, immigration stood in the Center.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial if they heard things which they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly spoke about the limits.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner and romney, the itself in the crucial inquiries in iowa and new Hampshire forwards. Has pushed
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, he is flexible with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked romney in which it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for work at his house to have adjusted.
The two sat down particularly violently as interrogators wondered whether one of the candidates an "Amnesty" (the illegal a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship would give.) would support
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a California Congressional representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this topic.
Neither of the two men has serious chances with the nomination, but both remain in the running, maybe because they earlier and harder than others. Have hit on the
At least in the area of the immigration, the candidates in the great and divide the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance in comparison with illegal migrants.
This topic, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries over the rest of the world, help the republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives to forget or to minimize.
But the debate was obviously problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to the fact that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is its preferential book, he the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now towards all expectations on the first place in a survey recently carried out in iowa thanks to his Christian conservativism existing for a long time, said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would support it, he laughed about this and said Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely wide open.
Huckabees ascent in iowa falls together with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and its storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are from the nothing, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates. Some could
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and convincing United with a victorious message about the size of America and a winking to two wings of the party.
The party is split this time and the result is not at all clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown still has a further pit for falling; its way from this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles seem sold, Parisian pays no politician, no hotel bills toes. To have been
However the exposure, that a rich businessman donations for the British governing Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people masked, and that the party failed to announce this, is something without that contested Gordon Brown well would have managed.
Than two months ago the Prime Minister the demand after a choice had escaped way the intelligence of the British insulting, by claiming that opinion polls would not have affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, such as vince cable, the increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed, the once dreaded Brown has developed from Stalin to Mr. bean.
The awkward rescue of northern rock, a shattered bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgement under bombardment.
Badly thought-out proposals for the change of the revenue laws have set enterprise associations against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative bunglings.
A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords from protest against reductions of military expenditure: ministers of the armed forces to be, so they claimed, a partial time job is.
Now there are the various contributions of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfillment) is already resigned.
Nothing of that means that brown direction breaks up withdrawal.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossibly to rule.
Still being allowed to people trust in politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism if a new troop takes the office.
If it is clear once that it is improbable that a Prime Minister improves the situation and it does not even need long in this case to be, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet to start; the press looks for bad news; and the government is defensive and aimless.
On a way the position of brown is particularly difficult, because he in contrast to other political leaders can not say, to be a new broom.
So with pleasure he Tony Blair would deny, it was his. Lieutenant
The problems with northern rock and the, for example, hang together with decisions which brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if the was not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" investigation of political party financing - go to the voters, possibly from this that he was it.
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The offenses are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As in the case of Mr. bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist tendencies always promised: a reliable, solid and easy brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams, which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he wants no public recognition for its goodwill.
This may be perhaps so, but the decision it wasn't entitled to it.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist from a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy entrance to those, which govern the country.
Watt, the says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will have to position itself some questions obviously; exactly as labours main finance recoverer the over the separate contributions in October. One told
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew from these confusion, although the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June. That was
Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work.
He has fast the violation of the laws by his party, but sentenced he diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full, of a bishop in the retirement and a judge.
In this case the "teachings to be pulled out of" not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things to make the Mr. brown must, as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life, to find the is vacant for six months, and to make progress with a drastic reform of political party financing.
That would require from the hardliners of the labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps the special financial relationship with the trade unions to abandoning - bitter pills for a party Member like Mr Brown.
But he should be conscious of some partial facts.
The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to win voters back; and the only way, as he can reach a victory is competence by incontestable honesty and solid.

British bänker plead guilty in the case of Enron
Three British banker, for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main of Enron, Andrew fastow, before the Court should be placed, changed their petitions into guilty on Wednesday.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew had originally for seven cases of fraud under use of for the alleged with fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000, about itself at the expense of their employer. Pleaded on innocent
The method had been set on January.
But during a hearing before the Court in front of us district judge Ewing werlein junior everyone pleaded for a case of fraud by use of Tele means of communication.
The three former executives of Greenwich natwest, a unit of the Royal bank of Scotland group plc, were in Great Britain in the course of delivery methods which lasted for two years. Known
In the United States their case is a loose end of an investigation, which was started after Enrons collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally submitted against it in the year 2002 drew fastow attention to the fact that it was the goal of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The accusation against the banker - called the "natwest three" - stated, they came in the year 2000 to Houston, about a fraudulent plot with fastow and his former top consultant Michael kopper hatch.
In Greenwich natwest had a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which invested was controlled by fastow, which was the architect of innumerable deceptive machinations, which contributed to the company in the whirlpool. To tear
The beginning of 2002, the Bank had the value their participation in the subsidiary on zero estimated, but the three British men knew that she had substantial value in reality.
An enterprise under koppers control acquired the shares of the Bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the accusation, wrongly, that opposite Enron, the energy enterprise 20 million dollars to Greenwich natwest for their shares in the subsidiary. Would pay
The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while fastow, kopper and other about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In the January 2004 known fastow in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow serves a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper serves a sentence of three years and one month in a mechanism in texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the reason a 1 million dollar bail, which made it necessary, that it is in the United States lived in expectation of the legal proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh-largest enterprise of the nation, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of bookkeeping tricks, the longer not more debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable business.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth lay and the former executive board chairman Jeffrey skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were futile, after he died because of heart disease last year.

The price of an airplane of the mark gulfstream g550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range, around nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, to fly is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"it offers place for up to 18 passengers," said Dan firer, a gulfstream representative.
"But none of them asks for so many seats, because it is for a family or an is."
Firer was at last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-daily of placed to consumption, which in a nested exhibition Center at the outskirts of the capital. Was organized
In addition to more than 200 other luxury suppliers had built up providers, for it hoping to money newly come Russians at all to interest of mahogany-paneled yachts up to diamond covered, would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer took cautiously a shining systems equips Porsche at the next exhibition booth in.
"this is a beautiful car, but it is small change in comparison with us," he said.
"after the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private airplanes."
Lit by an oil boom the Russian capital seems so flooded with money as Dallas to its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the, as some Americans to gigantic wealth came and went to Europe in troops where they were considered materialistic", said goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990ern, the Russians step as the in the world free money output units most visible.
The most exclusive luxury brands seek their share of gold fever.
Elsewhere in Moscow in this week a meeting of donatella, Tom Ford and Bernard arnault, the chairman of lvmh, attracted in order to exchange ideas about how one high-priced goods on markets like Russia. Can sell
(The Conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, the have in total 282 billion dollars, according to the forbes list of the richest people.
Furthermore 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, a total of 670 billion dollars worth, according to a study of the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, the one of wirtschaftsexperten of the Center for economics and research, an expert committee here, was written.
(the World Bank says that in the year 2005 15.8 per cent of the Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"there are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore we are all here", said Nicole marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
They had for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand, the soho jewelry group, the fair.

While they in Sunday night clothes through the halls are drawing two describe immovable,, 21, and Svetlana turovtsova, 26, themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked after the car looked ahead and I tried my mind between the infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche to decide", said the, clothing, the designer, rivers, which they, as a veteran with Joan rivers.
It seemed the fair in the first place on the Nouveau aim, the type of brand-conscious Russian who would be ready to be several hours in the jam to go to a drafty store, the geschmachloserweise cadillac escalades, pocket-knife of platinum, mövenpick, eiskrem made-to-measure platinum, appartments in Dubai and gund placed next to each other.
The public could tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars). Buy
"the Russians are interested to learn at, which mark the most expensive and best", said Mr. gijrath, at a booth of the Netherlands porcelain manufacturer Royal delft before a wall imitat of a Rembrandt picture from hand-painted, blue sat.
"Russians are natural more at jingling."
In fact the traders say here, that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old after Russian standards) already of logos to the kind of sober marks with limited quantities have moved, which did not with a commercial show became.
Several thousand people nevertheless pressed, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on last Thursday Roman ershov said, the general manager of King koil beds here, he would have two 70,000 dollar sets of silk, Kashmir and cotton, with manufactured, sells.

He showed a reporter a tire, which was developed for a Russian, with casino owner, which it had covered with colored swarovski crystals, so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The costs: 22,000 dollars. For a
"the Russian millionaire, the bunch or a picture of the face of his wife of cubic zirconium would like, will not travel unconditionally on these wheels", said Mr. karapetian.
"he will keep it in his 30 or 40-cars' garage."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr karapetian said the phrase "russiche millionaires" would not express much exclusivity momentarily, in view of the rise of the local real estate prices.
"If you three or four years ago have bought an apartment in Moscow, they are already presumably millionaire, at least on the paper, if already not in cash", he said.
"there are more of those than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least so to do as if they were rich at a stand of the of alliance continental, a Russian property. Was conducted

Bungled operation assumes with death in New Jersey
It was the day before the thanksgiving as Ronald livingston by the large glass window of the just a little healthier restaurant saw here and observed as an ambulance at the White Cape cod two doors of far below at the West Scott.
Soon after that. There was a police car
And then was there a further.
"then I saw the truck of the medical coroner approaching", said livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"that was the point as I knew that somebody had died."
The behören learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant of the director of the Newark police department.
Now, the investigators attempt to find out whether they died because of a procedure, that of a not certified, cosmetic surgeon was carried out, the police did not identify, and which in the House at the West Scott 212 worked.
The authorities have not yet determined which Mrs. arroyos has caused death, and are hopeful that toxokologische investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death, a sorrow by the the Newark police has sent yet.
Mrs. Arroyo was since September 2006 an assistant of the, Garry F. McCarthy, and their voice was known to many in the department.
"she was loyal, hard working and persistent", said Mr McCarthy over Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"it was my pitbull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo the woman of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer, who works for the, and that her two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter. Leaves
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the public prosecutor of Union county, Theodore J. romankow, said that investigators would try to find out whether Arroyo as a result of a not certified, surgical treatment died.
"this is one of the possibilities", Ms Walsh said.
"It is a current investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the House at approximately 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a SOFA.
She was declared death on the spot.
More than a week passed and the authorities have informed of little about their investigation or about the owner of the House, which is listed as a pile margarita Castro.
Walsh did not say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to find out whether a part of the House was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Mrs Castro's house where a shrub that wilted in the brief front garden and a dalmatian barks behind the House.
A blue barrel marked with "Ethyl vanillin" -- used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and -- sat in the parking lot next to a door, led to the basement.
Two mountainbikes hung of hooks on a side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived for the first time in Newark, after he 25 years with the New York had spent was Mrs. Arroyo of incalculable value and helped him in this case in the provincial and hard political culture in its new city.
"she said 'you must pay attention to this or that'", he said.
"she was always here, when I arrived here and it was always here, when I went.
It was embarrassing. "
Hopes that the Central Bank cut interest rates will lead to the rise
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try through the credit further cuts in interest rates to calm down, by soothing comments by the US central bank were confirmed.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and in the whole of Europe after small boat, the number 2 of Ben bernanke, the chairman of the Central Bank, said that the policy "flexibly and pragmatic" on the continuous pressure on the financial markets. Must react
Peevish markets in a clear effort to calm down, in view of signs of progress, kohn said, the recent turbulence would have "in part some of the improvements the functions of the late part of September and October." reverse
If the increased turbulence should last, it increased the possibility of a further increase of the financial conditions for consumers and enterprises, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to intervene and with new capital injections in the US markets and possible further cuts in interest rates to stabilize the terms of credit.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street, in view of of further bad news from the US economy, now since the sales of U.S. achieved a new record depression in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were of the announcement of bear stearns, which underlined that they 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their world-wide employees, in a measure for cost reduction, will eliminate about heavy losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places in London will disappear, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York the Dow Jones industrial index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close in the case, while the S & P 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent.
In London the FTSE 100 index rose about 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, in order to close with what more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.

The pressure on the Bank of England, the US central bank and the European Central Bank to follow, and another in the money markets in London, feed rose, the as one the credit's "libor" for lending between UK banks with 6.59 percent on its highest since late September saw, after a continuous increase since the 21 November.
England confronted with decision over the statements by owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost just as difficult as the others.
As who should number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend, owais Shah or ravi bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?
The second question is important, because David graveney, the, on call at least under this specific title, here is around the boss Peter moores and the captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide, and because the table of high morries, the English managing director, gradually with applications for national voter fills, if not even for what. In part-time
Who does not even always get the sixth, will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt.
It is never simply to nail exactly what a human being made it possible the top of his profession to reach, while someone else over the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only necessary in the, where the choice is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are subjective at the end always.
Is it the right time for bopara climb up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same can perhaps also in a wider range, be asked whether for example John edwards or "tubby" banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good conclusions, which know the business well should be promoted.
Who can say what the correct class for a cricketer, unless the possibility is given to him swimming or going down.
Numbers have of course a large influence on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team a cricketer must the eye of the captain to the right time catch, if he can take a wicket and a must get regular chances on the order, if he wants to do impression as a one-day.
To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson were apparently in the first test, will play even if Stephen harmison declares itself as healthy and as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope on still more.
Whether Shah or bopara in the asgiriya stadium, plays a only can be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it perhaps however makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul collingwood, to consolidate then still fightingly around himself, the the breakthrough to an important testkricketspieler created and that, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.
Probably is that graveney, Vaughan and moorland, after a further discussion in the course of today's meeting in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and belly's greater experience over net enthusiasm will follow.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of bopara, which is seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent balance against balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in the may against West Indies in the test in Lord, his arena as a player from middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the selectors as Vaughan was healthy about his position for the next game to take back, seems the momentum from its striking to have taken the was obvious still in Bombay.
In contrast the has Jack of all trades from Essex. Essex
He is of nothing on a impressed and its attitude off of it was taken to the point, as he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.
He suffered from smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the first, which he did, was his Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) out and his colleague Alastair Cook, which had observed this from the distance, and with enthusiasm to say: "have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better player on the field, he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds, which seems to fit him and hits with confidence and destiny.
The right man to select a thing, the right time to choose a different.
Perhaps this is the real art of the selection.

Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of refugees, whose funds or visas ran out, and others, which hoped that the city returns to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had expelled them from their houses.
At the bus station mansour, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen penalties, was the active to terminal with refugees from Syria and Jordan, had returned in private.
"I decided to go to Syria, after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad", said Sabah al-qubaisi, a doctor.
"today, I came back because of what I have seen on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what has happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the mahdi army stopped killing people ", he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric moqtada al-sadr who ordered his forces to the present time back to place.
Qassim Al atwani, a 38-year-old teacher from the overwhelming Sunni part of amariyah, returned with his two children, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not permit to work Iraqis.
His Shiite neighbors in amariyah called him in order to say to him that a militia local, supported by the USA helped Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital, and to expel insisted it for the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe of the from his house in sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with grenades had been expelled, after he had requested its fellow citizens for fight.
He returns in order to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they began one the Al-Qaida militia in sleikh and that it my support and that of my boys need it.
This is why I have returned today ", said sabaah alu, 62.
Many told that they by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. and the growth of local "groups affected citizens" had been lured what arms and in cooperation with the American military their boroughs.
But more spoke, home through visa problems and funds in Damascus to have been forced, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years.
Salaam al-samarrai, a 51-year father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister, had requested of the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions for the fugitives, in order to compel people for the return.
More than two and a half million people are probably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"to us it went well until Syria visited and the government pushed to the Iraqis no more visas to give, about them for the return in the Iraq to force", said the Sunni pensioners.
"I can not trust a government which supports the criminals, the House burned down after I went away."
A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunnis from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir sectarian tensions up again and it will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading with the job training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an education field the the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I have 'yesterday for the 50th time, that we are not French" -- the smallest state placards this slogan ironically to his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a large role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in the of the Institute of the German economy Cologne (iw) on place five.
So the universities cooperate already from tradition closely with the neighboring countries.
The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 of the Frenchmen.
Until today, students can conclude their study here with a double or even triple diploma.
The share is correspondingly high foreign students with 15.6 percent.
But also the Saarland brings the onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without a conclusion at the high school.
"in the Saarland one uses the vocational education system", expert, says at the iw.
More than every fifth teenager purchases his studies right at a vocational school, thus lies the Saarland more than seven percentage points over the.
Even the possibilities of a professional and academic education are comparatively strongly built up.
Measured in terms of the total population with the equipment is the dual courses is based in Germany.
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand, the number of the engineer in the past years, however, has dropped by a third.
Therefore the Saarland education Ministry engaged the universities now to a marketing campaign for engineer fan.
"at the general education schools, we have after the first PISA study activated a few reforms", says a spokeswoman of the education Ministry.
So the Government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
In order that the children to learn to use to begin is the last kita year free of charge -- a model, which in the meantime also other Federal States copy.
Whether the achievements of the students to improve themselves, will show, only future comparative studies.
With PISA 2003 shrank, the share of the risk of 29 to 20 percent.
Altogether the Saarland did not however increase so strongly as other States.
The Bavarians count better.
And to the annoyance of the are at PISA not measured - in this area, one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is at grammar schools - even if the no Frenchmen.

In Venezuela the clocks tick shortly differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez lets the chronometers in the South American country turned back by a half hour.
Meanwhile in Spain Chávez becomes the joke figure.
As the Gazette of Venezuela informed, according to a new law, the clocks on the universal minus four and a half hours.
In this way the südamerikansiche State gets a time zone which it in any other country of the world.
The Chávez justified his decision among other things on the fact that the United States of the world the division in time zones to full hours. Imposed
Moreover, Chávez terminated on Wednesday (local time) because of a canceled the breaking off of the relations with the neighboring Colombia announced.

"I can already alone because of my dignity", said Chávez of the advances a constitutional reform, over which the citizens of the oil on Sunday must vote in a referendum.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
Release of the controversy was the decision, to extract Chávez the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia to escape, with which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe has Venezuela with its decision "into the face" Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain is Chávez in all of it.
A new mobile phone-klingelton provides for furore in the country: "por qué no te callas" (why you do not bell the mouth) reads the sentence, which already more than half a million people downloaded from the Internet. Have
Spoke to him of the Spain's King Juan Carlos on the irritated by the constant interruptions of the iberoamerika-peak was and this had driven over the mouth.
German threatens in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation threatens German employees according to a forecast this year.
Experts mentioned a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the hans-böckler-donation the employees could 2007 material with less on the account than in the previous year.
"debt to it are the modest wage development, the value added tax increase and the with food and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for market research and research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also with the unemployment insurance to employees. Social
Minister of Finance peer Steinbrück said the "new osnabruecker newspaper", the planned lowering the unemployment insurance on 3.3 per cent to the turn of the year is indeed in the present situation right and sensible.
Though the federal agency for work may not come again in embarrassment with the Federation for loans or subsidies to have to ask, the SPD politician was quoted.

Altogether, the prices increased by 3.0 per cent year on year.
Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus is despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth as a similar ones so far meant: the European space probe "Venus express" has flashes in the atmosphere and eddies at the Poles were discovered, as they arise in the winter also on earth.
For nearly three decades scientists assume that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" produced the proof - they tracked down electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: the flashes on the Venus fire in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, told Christopher of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen-theorie" lightning the life on earth develop: thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean, which led to the formation of amino acids, the components of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "if there were ever lives there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there might on the surface of the Venus hardly give something lively: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on the earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the of the earth, but it is a twin", said russel.
Why the Venus, the the earth in mass and size so similar, a so entirely different development, is the basic question.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no probe more specifically for the Exploration of this planet. Was on the way
The latest research results which now in several "nature", be introduced after emphasize view of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within of the solar system.
"they also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first accepted", communicate with the ESA.
So the researchers found next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, also a vortex at the, the still substantially faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, a team of researchers writes about Giuseppe piccioni of the Italian Istituto Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. Almost just as large
The also described as a morning or planet circles in just 225 days around the sun.
But he concerns a lot slowly themselves: a lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions.
On the two water collected, which remained on the earth in oceans, on which Venus however lost into the area.
And while carbon dioxide on the earth in carbonate rocks, makes it on the Venus, the majority of the atmosphere.

Schaeuble warns of riots like in France
Battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots as in France.
It everything must be done so that social discontent in Germany does not discharge in force on the street, asked the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot with shotguns on the police: after the severe youth in France fears Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that not also with us social explosive develops itself and in force.
We must take this seriously ", he said the" new press "appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person get along with the quick change of the social reality.
Federation, countries and municipalities already worked with emphasis on decreasing problems, Schäuble said.
This concerns not only the integration of migrants.
"from the integration Summit to the conference of this already shows first successes."
For all clear it is, however, too early.
Schaeuble pointed out at the same time that it in German suburbs not urban development and sociological problems like in France. Give
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had had in the past nights difficult road battles with the police.
Also in Toulouse cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts of the Federal Government meanwhile demanded the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan kolat.
In view of the riots in France before kolat, warned of "imitation."
The situation in Germany is not indeed as explosive as in France.
However, there is nevertheless need for action.
Kolat referred to the fact that the unemployment rate is in the case of young people with migration background under 25 years "above the average high".
It must provide above all for more training places.
Kolat stressed: "We must give a perspective to the young people."
The chairman of the Turkish local authority added, however, takes place in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families".
Many young people with migration background did not moreover that to destroy what their parents here have built up.
Kolat reminded: "But in spite of this we must watch out."
One must give "the teenagers the possibility fast, at work and training".

In the realm of Angela cloud
Of the unrealistic appearance of the documents that the coalition is as regards content is at the end - and that of her nothing more is to be expected.
In which country does this Chancellor? actually
After their disconsolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, and meaningless was, one must say: not here - not in the country, which must finally be ruled over by it.
The accusation that it concentrates too much on the foreign policy, Angela Merkel has rejected with a badly overbearing sentence.
This is provincial, she said and thus showed only that she does not want to understand, for it is a matter for the critics.
In the Bundestag, it documented recognizable for all as the reproach is very correct.
Since neither concrete interest nor to feel a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela cloud presented itself: a lifted politician who flees in the foreign policy, and even there in the approximate. It remains
Example climate protection: she praises itself without brakes for the resolutions of holy dam, does not say, however, how the country climatic goals are to be achieved.
Anyway, the praise - so much immodesty would have the presumptuousness still two years ago.
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the upswing arrives at the people.
In this way it damages their image as a pragmatist, solve the problems instead of talking the world beautifully.
But in the realm of Angela cloud problems relating to domestic affairs. An edge appearance
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for.
Is calling as it often makes a mistake as it around the surcharge goes.
Merkel needs three approaches there, in order to bring a halfway straight sentence.
It stumbles as on foreign land if it gets concrete.
Department of attack
In the youtube debate of the republican presidential candidate himself deliver the two favorites rudy Giuliani and mitt romney a hard exchange - and must fear now a maverick candidate.
The strain of the candidates already with the first topic.
He has in New York to a "haven for illegal immigrants", reproaches mitt romney his opponent rudy Giuliani.
This counters for his part with heavy accusations: "I would say, its own House was a port for illegal", answers Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts, to have privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow for the attack: because the Republican base further no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all, in order to discredit their adversaries.
The 30 second, which sent Internet users in via, are hardly more than givers.
"with this kind of isolationism, we have made Hitler come onto the power", John McCain reproaches his opponent Ron Paul, as the only one in the round an immediate withdrawal from Iraq demands.
Also romney gets of viet Nam veterans strongly the read, when he refuses, the so-called "waterboarding", an method, with which drowning is simulated to condemn as torture.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign, however, in the meantime on the other side of Iraq war and torture, lie the show of the reactions in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases declined approval surges in. On
Shows up once more, where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.

The fathers of the plant skirts back
Germany's super of the seventies plays again: the three volume Members of harmonia planned their at a concert in Berlin before once more.
To the revival a monitoring appears from their large time "live in 1974".
Already at that time they were substantially more famous abroad.
The scheduled sensation happens then in the form of three gentlemen at the board.
Everyone has his box before itself, its cable and above all its buttons.
Dieter moebius sits enthroned in the flower shirt in the middle with 63 years.
Links flanked by Michael rother, 57 years young and in the possession of computer and guitar.
To the right, from the auditory looks at solo, 73, concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it makes mistake to a conventional piece of music.
That seems not even then also the gentlemen to greatly. Disturb
That the band harmonia again ensured under skirt lovers for some excitement.
Which one may reveal here: specific demands showed that although the name through the collective, but by no means so lastingly, around this band painfully since 32 years. To miss

Some held harmonia from that.
The first album was called "music of harmonia" and the following "de luxe".
Because the music so calmly and modestly also rang, the band suffered material need.
The brushwood didn't alone the self identification.
The now appeared CD "live in 1974" was at a concert in griessem, before a scarcely record scenery, as someone to remember believes.
Came from rother, at that time, the desire to push and to practise it occasionally.
For solo and moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in one and secured itself its existence with albums such as "fiery hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and is since then more successful than it ever was.
The griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert groenemeyer.
Its disk company Greenland, put it to the goal of the plant as characteristic German contribution to cultivate music to the live.

Richard gere is simply not cynically enough
With "the hunting party" and "dreadful peace" two films deal again with the Balkans war.
But both do not.
Either the concepts put too much on action and geballer or however they are too sentimental.
There also Richard gere in "the hunting party" does not help.
The good news: at first be sure the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia, now the actor Richard gere. Been found again
We had the most beautiful man of the eighty years finally from the lost sight of, because too many roles in for women and too many press conferences on the subject a Buddhism the desire on seeing.
Now Richard gere is suddenly the most important argument, "the hunting party - if the hunter to the gejagten becomes" (why must be today actually always be so long and? as train) Perhaps anyway. Look at
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: strictly speaking its war, the Simon hunt what from gere could have become, if the fate and the reporter were not so benevolent: a man, his very best times for a long time behind itself, but himself as a monument of his fall still preserved considerable residues of the former charm. Has
But in spite of this, "the hunting party" together with the German production, "dreadful peace", which likewise starts in this week, only the endless series of failed. Continues
With "murderous peace," one can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), the a serbin from SAVE, on which the one promptly also still in love with them.
Although it is welcome that here once not the Serbs as exclusive root of all evil are represented, the loses itself film too fast in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but for that. With war
On the other hand it can to "the hunting party" almost exemplary, why it did not actually never yet a right good. Has given
The story of the three U.S. prepare themselves in order to the Serbian "the fox" with would have to track down another director and another film script (both in personnel Union Richard shepard) to another time maybe a new "Apocalypse Now". Able to be
Because the stories are alike yes: small teams go both times in the forest, in order to achieve something, what the militaries not can and both times it becomes a journey into the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the hunting party" is that one is not Simon hunt not simply the descended cynic with heart, as the he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must it in addition still a romantic affair with a Bosnian murdered later.
Finally "the hunting party" go then the brook down, if the reporters within the last five minutes in the successful, what NATO, CIA and all of the world did not manage in five years: the war criminal catch and to the Muslim Bosnians for the fair revenge left.
This is so bad that one of the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the call would like to.
The film has a deeply human request.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree for once) the following due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively.
But the well and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous comes into the sense.
It is called in it over the wood mask of an Asian demon on the workbench of the poet: "I see the swollen front forehead,: how hard it is to be bad."
Films such as "the hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads, however, indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited.
Recently is in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films were large flops.
One can add: it also has never yet a good South. Given
Nearly always applies: if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world, then comes so something like this out "Rangoon" with Patricia arquette, "beyond all limits" with Angelina jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo dicaprio.

Some film will probably still the -- mature as classics now geltenden "the deer hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "full metal jacket" are at that time really by no means unanimously been celebrated as masterpieces.
But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time on two screens to immediately comes home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenplay writers of the, which needs it in order to tell good stories.
"existence or" or "the great dictator" are really finally therefore as well, have become so good because lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime. There was really
Perhaps, one may not want to be good, if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps the one must disassociated artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk.
Than the to parallels between its historical novel "lemprières dictionary" and Balkan war was questioned, he answered: "that is only because of the fact that some things never change.

Nevertheless, the dream is not for all time, said von beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (hsb) regretted the statements of beusts.
By this means the impression is that Hamburg in the next 25 years, not more for Olympic Games. Wants to apply
"It is too early to obstruct a chance for himself, by one the plans already at this time buried", said Günter ploss. On Wednesday,
Moreover, a renunciation of the application contrary to the statement of the boss on the occasion of a receipt for the Assembly of the general German university Sport Federation.
There from the application of Hamburg for the universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.

The SPD citizenry fraction accused the Senate of valuable time for the House building in Hamburg to have used.
"the development of the small grasbrooks was delayed by the Senate for years, because he put Olympia on the card and" ignored "the House building", said the SPD representatives Carola veit and Jan quast.
While the SPD for the was always an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use, the CDU on one side on the "factor".
The application for the Olympic summer games 2012 had initiated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig, though.
