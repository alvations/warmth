The lack of snow in mountain hoteliers bothers
Deserted trails are not a problem that the operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people book their stays in skiing in hotels and pensions.
Because of this, it is still possible to find rooms free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users roam the tender, asking prices but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to pass the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too reluctant to book.
If the priority is given to the economies and that the quality of accommodation only then, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers of Špindler propose for the moment that stays a week for the New Year.
I think they will try again a moment of the place, but they also cemeteries and accept shorter periods of time.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The Agency of tourism of Ingtours Vrchlabí also proposes yet beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we are most interested in at the moment, it is not completely sold.
He remains free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few visits last minute Christmas less expensive, "said the director of Petr Ingtours Schiefert.
The agency Vrchlabí tourism may also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The first fourteen days of February go well, the remaining winter trips are moderately.
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there was still no snow Krkonoše.
People expect that it will start to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the runways are covered during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel Horizont to Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five percent.
We still have a few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays in January of Polish and February sells well too, "advises Karel Rada, Director of the best hotel in Pec.
Omnia Hotel near the central car park Jánské Lázně is also full to eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the latest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation at the moment.
February is a bit lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše still enlarging certainly indicated the Director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers of Krkonoše must not, however, expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there is, they should be caught in the mountains.
But subsequently, the time should warm, informed Jiří Jakubský Station of Hradec of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United STATES: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even funny, the diligence with which Barack Obama, president to the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he considered himself as simple.
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had recopied in carbon paper since the Iraq scenario of Bush of three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, more importantly, to use the title of the speech by Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road before"
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in Iraq a consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, showed that Bush ’ s strategy, which was the recommendations of commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success at this point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it has left his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
This is again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase of military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, which even has severely criticised the reluctance of the White House in spite of patterns of subordination.
He asked 40 000 men in order to be able to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months but for lack of a better alternative, at least he had defrauded the General of 10 000 soldiers.
He has managed to pull the promise of 5 000 additional from Europe, even if it had over 10 000.
This leads to the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be his intention to withdraw the armed forces from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this process in three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of past years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, accustomed to change from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain as a smokescreen behind which proliferate ethnic relations patriarchal.
It is extremely difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity on the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a "speedy state to act", which is the purpose of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy of Obama makes puzzled by his resoluteness.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely heart romantic and outside of reality can be confident that the young soldiers sent in the tumult of the war to "return to the home" will bring a miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will see this as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the European desire to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving toward the negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents why security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no impact on the Iranian, the US will be dealing with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond, for example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that it is working on a new strategy, if it proves to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses in cash
The senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive shares instead of cash, they could not resell before five years.
The shares may be withdrawn to leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs arises as leader of the effort to link the rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that we need to take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of society JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, "he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost 17 billion in premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the year, the total amount of premiums will probably 20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to the news agency Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it had to assign a single fee of fifty percent bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have received the Nobel Prize in all areas apart from the physical
These are five women, a record number, which received today in Stockholm by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the Nobel Prize in the technical disciplines, and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the Romanian-born German writer Herta Müller.
Two U.S. biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider were received with their countryman Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the area of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to have clarified the structure and function of the ribosome
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, US Elinor Ostrom with his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has no winner this year was the physical.
The award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are the basis of all digital cameras, fax or telescopes.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reached 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (Approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them contains several winners, they will share the reward them.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize laureate has already been filed this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since it is only at the beginning of his journey, and it is in addition to the head of a country engaged in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy, he added that in certain situations the war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister Janota intends to resign. Klaus has invited at the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it has been passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota cabinet will be on the agenda of the meeting on Friday.
Klaus also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which widens the public finance crisis.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota wants then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget, which will be submitted to the signature of Vaclav Klaus, is a deficit of $163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the proposals of the left with respect to transfers of money and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accuses the proposals of the Social Democrats, the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left the government, Mr Klaus and the right to disagree, calling into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by Members, removes the package of savings by the Government of Fischer and that it should halt the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who may ratify the legislation on the state budget, but that there is no requirement, said today during a breakfast discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "disability irréfrénable" of public finances.
Now there was, according to him, no positive solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The Chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should rethink its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas ČTK said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer has described such words of "drastic" verdicts ".
The leader of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called successful ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by US actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood movie - Invictus Invaincu will present to the world a lot of things on the country, its struggles and its victories.
The story speaks of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, U.S. actor rewarded for Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela, 91 years of age who asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I said to him: "If I embody, I should be able to see you personally..
The actor aged seventy-two years which has been awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery itself became a slave, a President of the USA, even God in the film "Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and so important to so many people as Mandela.
The State ex-homme South Africa was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and this is the title of a poem in the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He was persuaded to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked a few years to bring the history of Mandela on screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the closest to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me this was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the man of international politics were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands.
I realized that when I shake hands, I recover your energy, it transmits and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team, in which there was a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, he has opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I have the air much greater in the film ".
Despite the differences between the players and the actual models, Invictus under the guidance of director Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the newspaper Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "This is a very good history, a film very well done."
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive assessments.
The mystery of the will in Norway is committed: The Russians tested a rocket
It has been observed a strange phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Ministry of Defence Russian acknowledged that yesterday to have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has, however, been a failure and the missile type "Bulava" which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated in the test of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava has not disappeared, or it is damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the "missile not flying"
A missile that is not flying but shining
This 13th test was conducted early normally.
It is only at the end of the flight that there was again damage on the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is the reason why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the was likely by a "Bulava" defective.
The rest, the Norwegian did not doubt for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk absolutely failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and damage has not affected than the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have been failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the general optimism and they therefore argue that a day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclei of hypersonic a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetissov 51 years, has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
The defender legendary Viatcheslav Fetissov will return in a professional game in 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will help his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà during the match on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, which ended his career in forty years in 1998, is currently the President of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to resolve some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, cited by the agency AP.
It was not clear if the Comeback of the legendary hockey player will not only a game.
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental health of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov becomes the Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant of Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant has confirmed.
The management wants to get agreement yet with unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, which is why voluntary overtime were proposed on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, "said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team for Saturday.
It will be also attributed a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way of motivating its employees in exchange for overtime.
They either receive the supplement for hours in more, or they can ask leave of replacement on 28 December and extend their year-end holidays aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transportation and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and most warm in the comments and the claims of the unions as employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two hours in more of their eight hours.
Unions have cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The negotiation between the direction of the car factory and trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were prepared to stop the state of strike in cases of agreement on their claims and signing of a common document.
The situation in the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees started spontaneously on strike because of incessant overtime.
They were protesting against the poor conditions of salary and so-called bizutages.
Management has defended with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to complete the imperatives of production of automobiles.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, unions have also requested that the employees who ceased production will not be subjected to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5 000 crowns (209 €) for them.
The automotive plant Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Discovery Czech: A substance that operates on the HIV virus "resilient" also
A team of German and Czech tests new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
This is, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination is not so intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present.
It nevertheless can prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs to prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
Consumption is, however, a series of side effects.
The repression of this multiplication effect is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs are no longer effective.
The work of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way of coping with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used until now, and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the proteins in the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a three-dimensional structure unique: Two cages for multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus traitor and resistant.
HIV protease is a protein from the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would not have birth of infectious particles mature the virus.
If you stop HIV protease, it will stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers explained in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their research, published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically altered.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical drugs, however it is not diminishing the resistant versions, against which the current medications are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to examine more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Director of structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is Fischer, who defends
The president of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget ratified for the following year, and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister has described the remarks of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said that take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly more.
After Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his duties with the assistance of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, however, with the proposals for amendments to a height of 12 billion included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The grievance of the government to the proposals of the Social Democrats, was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of $163 billion kronor.
ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the Government as a modified budget is a variant less bad than a budget of acting.
Disappointment and worthlessness
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his duties in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation could be different.
After the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with Prime Minister after its passage in government:
He indicated at the same time, he wondered whether he would stay in his duties.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the ODS is not in issue.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and across the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing wrong, said in a news release Topolánek text from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments are TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of conducting a fight against the amount of the deficit in the public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and after that it will be on the agenda when I want, "said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to government by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked on the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time as the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked Members to allow Democrats voting for the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered accusations from the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
Czech Railways will remove or limit from December 13, some express trains or regional less responsible, and instead would increase some.
The total coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedule of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rate and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava who will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be dramatically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transportation for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, by contrast, Prague and its environs can rejoice an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, you can see the introduction of a new line of direct Milovice in Prague: For the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of Esko suburb, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines distant to the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines HC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will depart by intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up in Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for the regional railways: 200 million kronor.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transportation and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion kronor to address the losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in height of nearly three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now, the length was always a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only the tickets a day ČD Net and tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a map of reduction, the price of ČD Net increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška newly will depend on the journey, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region to choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped today, 75 people in the southern Philippines, among which a primary school students and their teachers.
It is the AFP Agency who informed, but who spoke at the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels have used hostages as human shields during a leak to the police.
The local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP Agency, police initially pursued the kidnappers following the violence caused during a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the election of the administration of Governor there avait30 journalists.
The governor of the province in the southern Philippines has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the killing, and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the lineage of influential Ampatuan.
Mindanao also includes Muslim separatists assets.
They have however renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
The new Hollywood movie Clint Eastwood arrives in U.S. theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title is Czech Invictus: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fight against apartheid universally known returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion of South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theatres, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela,
His full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993, he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations because it is presented at a time when the South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup football, and secondly because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the share of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, in his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role of long years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover its energy, "he said at the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if it has the possibility of recall via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this is for each individual, he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of the novel to the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that has given its creation to the people portrayed the South African champion of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman try during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between wearing the jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa won then.
To be shown on the lawn in jersey, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been standing ovation fourteen years mostly white audience, and was recognized by the white populations.
Let us hope that the football championship will unite people again in a single nation, said the rugby Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black 'of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the South tense situation will improve.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical as recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of kronor in flames in the area of Louny

The damage is estimated at tens of millions of kronor, the exact figure will be known once the fire was extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed should be replaced by a new one.
She added that in 10 years of activity, the company Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this kind are isolated.
Electricity supplies had not been interrupted, "said the spokesperson ČEZ for the Northern Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, government and industry has not been influenced by the fire of the station.

Jančura will lodge a complaint for slander against three of the prefects ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today complaint for slander against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet MINUT of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have, however, eventually sign long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three were attacked and say that is the fine hydrants, whereas it was only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways which were signed last week.
Therefore we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said the Jančura Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the filing of the complaint of Mr. Jančura represents the result of its media spectacle that provides free publicity for his company and his person.
Of course I am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jančura manipulating public opinion and use of false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, "says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kronor in an advertisement that indicate the steps against regions.
He said to Radiožurnál that it discontinues the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura launched his campaign after the regions agreed to give the Czech Railways operate rail links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing a call for tenders.
After Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a Member of ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, we could lose our licences buses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, but I would not say his name, "said Jančura today at Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria will be free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcus will reverse the old habits since January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for the families.
Voices are already, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of vaccination against pneumococcus peak.
Pharmaceutical Institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay for the insurance.
The experts also see clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
The free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against free pneumococcal bacteria.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we began the vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay yourself the vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the sickness spend 300 to 450 000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Until now, the state was spending approximately 500 000 crowns per year for the vaccination of children.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the "package Janota."
Pneumococcal bacteria are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including the inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
After investigations in hospitals, there has until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded.
Vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on a possible obligation of vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference to which our association has participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a vaccination optional.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that he must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not to modify the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We are absolutely not for the moment, "said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Society of pediatricians, recognizes that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be a decrease of renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said however Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcus marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is financed by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should free up funds for prevention, and save on potential future medical care.
Doctors have to buy their products themselves
This, however, is linked to the worries of pediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines by insurance companies, doctors, the receiving the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance "to deduct the amounts of sickness insurance."
Thus, physicians will need to buy the products and expect that the insurance companies reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians should individually invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
And we always
Islam can be French?
The pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger b at Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be intrigued by this new book, fans of the last book of the author, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book of Mr Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes in France now provide this queM. Bozen called "Muslims spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secular nature of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be obtained with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises with the historic secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "low key values".
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The view of the world's darkest
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing boats in new waters open, with diplomats, lawyers, and now the writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the north polar bears.
Knowledge of the history and complicated political whaling, he described the long tradition of the Arctic explorers who were their evidence hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years who had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, caught as they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a show celebrating 75 gathered at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo is typically a millionth of the area required by an adult in freedom. climate is rarely mentioned: A polar bear living in Singapore became because green algae that grew in their thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians, and often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters by helicopter and the Indians, Inuit use motoski fusilsd' powerful assault to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of these two nations of the hunt that ice will stay longer.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear summary and frightening the science of the Arctic and a captivating insight into what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers can tell exactly the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the initial information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes of relief sous-celle-ci.
Surveillance probes and satellites placed on icebergs are a great help, but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened, camping out in the cold.
Mr. Anderson admires the extraordinary world and tiny of the system depends on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water rushed in freezing.
But the bear mentioned above to microscopic marvels contained in the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of the ice, was planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, perhaps it will be our turn"
The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class Beijing Angello Robinson, 19, made a trip of seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina Cemetery at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If it was me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of the veterans in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, Maine, has launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, are each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize celebrations in honour of the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Des crowns across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers have placed more than 16 000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery in Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military man died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, "she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers have market between the lawns and hills expanses of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose former graves, dating back to the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not often visited that new graves, said organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples stood by the hand, bearing fresh pine wreaths on the graves grey.
Each krona round was a dark green, with a small neckwear red on the top.
Nearby, hung over the silence on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the sour mood of the current wars filled the area.
People were crying without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small maps of information black and white, steeped in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to come and collect on the grave of Marine Sergeant Shane GunneryDavid Spicer, died in combat in July.
No person should ever forget through what we are free … my son has paid for it, "she said.
"Long after I am gone, I want someone remembered."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US national who was mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives, Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of be "dangerous".
All activities so-called revolutionary, including protests moderate and critical writing, raise the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by Government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of a US citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "subtle" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, in order for the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are authorized to Cuba, although consumer goods, new and desired in a country where the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are used primarily for text messages or to a conversation of 15 minutes which corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few US in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "said Gloria Berbena, Press Secretary to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity which, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas program director of the group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a harsh report on the freedoms in Cuba, called" New Castro, Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to the United States, when the two countries begin to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organisation supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they had hoped that the case would demonstrate a significant network of recruiters of terrorists are plundering the Internet in search of young men radicalised.
Investigators said they hunted a personality insurgente hidden, known under the name Saifullah, who invited these men in Pakistan after discovered when one of them has made comments endorsing the waves terrorists on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret service, which had been informed of the matter said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Because of this, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of northeastern prohibited become a haven for terrorism.
They have been considered as undercover agents.
That is why they have been rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the matter.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry in the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
These five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for infiltrate men in the al-Qaeda network.
Recruiters from the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the U.S. potential recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said that the terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of people that they accept because the US secret services have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? Said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for an "action" to the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have walked the streets here Saturday, calling for more extensive action on the climate of the negotiators working in the conference hall Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100 000 people, but 25 000 according to estimates of the police.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little thing happened during discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying, 'There is no planet B "and a Spanish, saying," The Earth said she has had enough. "
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, who opened her eyes on the really tough issues facing the country because of the impact of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to get the word, and launching an appeal to world leaders to take decisions that are fair, ambitious and engaged, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who requested anonymity because of his involvement in discussions on climate, the activists who wore masks and black clothing, started several explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments.
Thrown near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed later by "a few large explosions".
Within the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have not been able to revive the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful to the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, "he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between races.
The federal report last week on the results in math has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the lead institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National evaluation of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the scores of white and African-American, at both the local and national.
The results of white children of Grade 4 (4) to WashingtonD.C. have increased over the last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling just one point, 245 to 244.
The result means white, has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in a class of Grade 4 (4), when the first report was published, the District NAEP, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed the concern that the increased celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions, Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and embarrassing, "said Jeff Smith, Director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equality in education in the District.
I do not immediately jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately in need of attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what is fear, is that we don't spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for schoolchildren classes of end of cycle Elementary and early college who does not have integrated the bases of reading earlier in their school and who are lagging behind their peers.
Each day, the mathematics curriculum for grades Kindergarten (Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who must also be credited to the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students at a lower level than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less successful in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California, Berkeley who studied the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting may have political repercussions that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the Superintendent of Schools, she tries to use the middle class white and black.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools of neighbourhoods in order that all families, regardless of where they come from, are confident that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements for success is the duration of the traditional public school, today of 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" for an increase in the next contract.
To make higher education a promise of future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, and a time cligne eyes from the sight of white columns, facades of bricks and luxurious lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to finish the school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) Group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less than a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super This is where I study! Gushed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide heading towards the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi, really? "She says pensive, when he said the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visited the children during their voyage of discovery of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The issue is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic migrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at school -- a notable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they pave the way for future generations that will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying the wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate human need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high expectations for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to arrive until the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network to these children from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that has funded the visit of universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (prepare you), it provides more than $300 million per year to systems of local schools to organise the preparation programs at the university that begin when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Department of Iraqi oil obtained agreements with foreign oil companies.
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Department of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had set an auction has lost.
Two American companies have won contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are European and Asian companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer be made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability, while the U.S. military troops withdraw U.S. oil companies have slowed, preventing them from entering with greater force in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Department of Iraqi oil and brought their technical advice, came away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two major shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more outbidding contracts that other companies and emerged with significant shareholdings in contracts for two main areas.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit auction bid which were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, said Friday U.S. authorities Counter-Intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan, according to U.S. and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, "said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
Officials have said that local activists suspects rushed on site and were quickly confiscated what remained of the "body completely shredded".
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. counter-terrorism officials have given evidence not specified that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers of military officials who ran the al-Qaeda terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Her role was to organize conspiracies in the world, "said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this likely included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic direction of al-Qaeda leaders and were translated into action plans for potential terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida' and had very good relationships with other extremist groups in the region.
It is not known to the general public, but this did not diminish the threat that he poses to us and our allies, "said the second official representative.
If her death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al-Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, approximately six transactions per month to two, according to the figures provided by the Long War Journal, a Web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability in killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential elections, supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
UN envoy said he supported the increase but it has expressed its concern about the timing of the United States for a withdrawal of troops that would begin within 18 months and that would oblige the other NATO governments withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and to remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning but that it would honour the commitment that he made to his family, in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement.
The representatives said that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping operations of the UN.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- who was thanked -- "have prejudiced the mission because there was already a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of the elections".
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the Heads of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of hiring the UN impeded his opportunities to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have not been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic, and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me the most, is that I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that "a package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact in less good security with nuclear weapons, "because" his people would suffer a lot of these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement to the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face the consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its oversight agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists it wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to surrender a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, medium build confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be away from attempts to agreement - in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think the stiffening of Iran to address some of the proposals of the international community to which they had given their agreement in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, "said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was once called "increasing sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what she called "unsubstantiated allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said it was agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before boarding the plane for the oil rich region of Kurdish so derencontrer troops, officials in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal outstanding. The American authorities were quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We preserve your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
Aging in China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by the propaganda poster preaching, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby it is even a tomb in more".
If they have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the rate of birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have dramatically changed direction this summer and began to encourage couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and farm: Never.
We have already given all our time and energy to only one child.
There is no second, said Wang, age 31, Director of Human Resources, and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population by 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the wealthy coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, those aged 60 and over accounted for 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Population of Shanghai Municipal and Planning Familial) stated that the fertile pairs were to have babies to 'help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future ".
Shanghai is on the point of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive mitigation
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial introduced by the Communist government.
The couples who break this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have had recourse to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys to girls - abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one child policy.
In 2004, they have been more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already only children -- and 2007, they have softened their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai, became the first city in China to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encourage families to have only one child, have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to make the application.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
A disappointing response
While officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, still does not receive four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in the Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Sage, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to deliver have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners believe, incorrectly, that the one child policy is a problem, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we flew the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only a single child because she was a itself. "We were at the centre of the family and had the habit that everyone cares."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else, and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company says it more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle-class, to lower the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents struggle in the early days of China capitalist and do not want to have this style of life, "he says.
Even one child requires a lot of time with his parents, "he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You must amend your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you must write his CV for a place in the best mother tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The Group of the United Nations draft plans for the reduction of emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN -- characterized to date by assignments disorganized and mutual recriminations -- is back in the spotlight Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining barriers, provided that he has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the UN, the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to cope with climate change, short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues including how developed economies and the emerging economies news could reduce their output of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to concentrate on what has described the Executive Secretary General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their collective emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduced from 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help poor countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States to the negotiating climate has dismissed any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been, it was two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not sufficiently to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei has said that the chief negotiator, lacked "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the US would not financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects occurred both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States querellant on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo ulate, a Delegate of Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also on the climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure to obtain a treaty requiring legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the political process is complete," in part by what they are now united and they require to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian environment minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Deputy Minister Chinese are descended from the aeroplane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be reviewed during the course of the next week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13 000 people entering and exiting the Palais des congrès every day -- activists guitar players present performances nocturnal mocking country which they betray and that proposals are developed and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is growing: Almost all key Ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of major, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle when entering the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first commuter train at high speed the country will reach 225 km / h, whereas it filera of Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable, and will link the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become flourishing suburbs, periods of business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and train car to reduce national emissions of carbon, while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of environmental hazards can dampen the high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres in the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high-speed network, from the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line is divided in two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from west Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another going to the northeast, near Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It appears that this will be the best option for performance has said a professional of rail.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km / h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Industry experts say that the rail only St Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to roll out of high-speed lines on the existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure the passage of planes, trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of rail.
Taxpayers repay the loan of £75,000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the senior Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a Orangerie he has built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron to be complaining that members of parliament were "maintained", has increased its borrowing of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home, in Rutland.
He had been authorised to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who has a control of expenses of members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or more simple".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
Neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, describing in its plans as an orange farm.
The neighbors describe as a "porch for pleasure".
He has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase of borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and standards of the Commons, concerning its provisions for loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of a charge of breach of the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of the loan of £271.406 his property in London at the home of his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month for mortgage interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were designed to finance the borrowing of £75,000.
The interest rate variable standard RBS rose 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since.
The last publication of Commons authorities showed that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position of Manager of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in the coverage was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" of the m …. "
He said: "I have spent my money in my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was right.
And I would have been able to claim a damned sight more, but I have not. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as an oil trader, has begun to explain its expenditure, in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of M Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "This was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the fees office then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of escape or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
True, you all see the timetable of Advent of Brighton
The cabs of Brighton beach have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, a schedule of Advent interactive.
Beyond, a group of the church alternative that encourages the spiritual exploration by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. each day, with pies and wine served hot free.
The songs of Noel chosen to date include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noel," for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years ago, an assistant marketing TV in Hove, unpaid is a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We wish that religion is closer to the people in a society post-chrétienté.
"As a church, why do we assume that people come in an old building strange? It seems to me that the Church should bring people together and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of the timetable for Advent of the cabin of beach came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a place where creative and vibrant, and we try to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. "
Delays in payments: Anger warders, planned actions
Unions have called for prison warders Friday to the "general mobilisation" to require the payment by Christmas bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
(2nd FO-pénitentiaire union of supervisors) asked the staff who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in prisons and the "block" to "denounce the theft of their due."
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union of the profession) called "to meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for strong mobilization," as "shameful and unacceptable" non-payment in December of 'overtime, night premium, Sundays and holidays "worked in October.
And the first union to supervisors, the federal Union prison autonomous (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for a general mobilisation (...) to raise the discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the prison administration and the Department of Justice explained that overtime hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the balances will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said late in the day that Michèle ALLIOT-MARIE had sent a letter to trade unions of their supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made in the next month.
I know the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writing the Minister of Justice in the mail.
I have asked the leadership of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation born of a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not happen again in the future, "added Mrs ALLIOT-MARIE.
The pay in December will therefore be lean, except for the management of the famous receiving bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good back".
This is a scandal, was indignant inter-regional union TF of Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and invitations."
The staff will not work on Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take money to staff, believes the CGT-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are worse than others.

According to him, the judge Rittenband -- died since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), even the prosecutor, David Wells.

Thirty-two years ago, it is enough ".

The son of singer, air relaxed, assured that it would be "very quickly" to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer has been "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort to prevent suffering and is able to administer treatment", said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors in the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperation Wednesday night to Thursday because of significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife went for Friday morning at the French Lycée in Los Angeles where is educated their daughter Jade, to attend a performance at school, found an AFP photographer.
The chief of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the hospital the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would make himself Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the international Monceau Clinic Park in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible judicial procedure to come, "he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "party much too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the surgeon in Paris."
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, as I myself had two slipped discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had said that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything", after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
It had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor in the reputation Zuma, repeatedly condemned by justice, in cases of medical liability and for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of Doctors, was accused of being a "man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "not recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "quite well" and that the post-operative tests were "normal".
The operation was "not hemorrhagic, and does not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, Ed.) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the New Centre not to use its logo
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, the symbol of the ex-parti giscardien, warning not to use on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, holding that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after having reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past in NC), which claims ownership of the trademark UDF for having been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to let themselves be deprived, has broken his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, summoning them to no longer use the symbol and the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to offer your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the MoDem party, as well as Senator Jean ARTHUIS centrist Alliance.
You also have to follow up on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the + + New Center, the slogan + the UDF today +, also find the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this symbol, explains the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF any medium and (his) website."
It also asked Mr Hervé de Charette "to pass the property of (the) to mark its legitimate right holders".
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978," and noted that Mr. Morin and his friends had been "the choice of leaving in 2007" to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the UMP. "
The New centre was therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the MoDem party for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the moral and material interests" of training based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continued the office, "when he filed the mark", it was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently the abscence of filing of the acronym for the UDF to his account.
This caused is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils, prior to mock, on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself to try out of anonymity by using a false name to which it was not entitled".

But the 15th criminal chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years old, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heiress and a major shareholder in L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, not in any case in the terms proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
Designated physicians Friday will submit a report before March 10, 2010 in saying if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think that it will.
I'm going to talk, "said at the end of the hearing, counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
It is an excellent new (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For the last two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, photographer and journeyman entertainer, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, contracts of life insurance or tables of masters.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which it sees as a long-time friend.
While the court to examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleadings of lawyers have sometimes turned to the great family unpacking Friday.
Thus, counsel Liliane Bettencourt has reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre again took the view that the complainant was not entitled to act, particularly as a guardianship judge has denied these last few days of his application to open a procedure for judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the capacity to act in court, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No other person has to act in his place, "said the department's representative public, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court decided that it would once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of big French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain …
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises vis-à-vis its employees, recalls the position of firms vis-à-vis the consumers before the revolution marketing: It comes to join the staff to "values" identified above as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has provided marketing strategies of conquest of markets where... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products to customers' preferences return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that affects in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R & D and, more importantly, of the economic intelligence.
In effect, the EI "requires of all stakeholders (…) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment from employees that the revenues of management authoritarian totally frustrates.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as well as the client.
The usefulness of any opinion surveys internal
Opinion surveys internal – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
Firstly because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure in finally arrived, after many detours, primarily … what it has always done.!
- Second, because the authoritarianism – may pathologies of the increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic understanding of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behaviourist, recently revived by the "Neurosciences" American and widely disseminated, unbeknownst to them, by the institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in The Figaro.fr conforte-t-elle leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, inadequate in the world today.
Identify and measure the factors of
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary to the functioning of modern business, is a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: For employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined DOXA which allows them through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, forecast and anticipate their "social performance" and put their management of human resources "."
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust economic intelligence and effective.
Oslo discourse: The "just war" is right to praise to Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday the speech the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé awarding the prize to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential address, like Sarah Palin, the former Vice-presidential candidate in the election of 2008.
I liked what he has said, "said Mrs Palin, creative partner of the right wing of the Republican party, the USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have been published.
The war, of course, is the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, she said.
Mr Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done at Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world," in the words of the president.
By some side, I found this quite historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed for the radio program" The takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was glad to have seen "a left-wing president" to remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a price of peace if the resort to force was not".
For Michael Gerson, the former pen of George W. Bush turned columnist at the Washington Post, Mr Obama said "a very American".
In addition to present themselves in a "citizen of the world", as he always does, "" he spoke as an American president, "reminding Europeans" that they live in a bubble of security they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, "said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, has described the speech as "dull, stilted and without inspiration" on the National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich is alarmed to see Barack Obama justify recourse to force.
When the envelope war in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the killing of innocent people, "he cautioned.
The press centre-left Commendation remained at the place of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, called the speech "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", was ignited the daily in California.
Mr Obama "delivered the speech that he had to", said the New York Times, saying "both sombre and uplifting".
Road: Three marathons for an agreement that saves the supplies of Christmas
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, unions of the road sector and TLF, only employers' organisation to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday evening at an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the sitting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique BUSSEREAU, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the morning of Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in late morning the text of the agreement.
And even if three employers organisations (FNTR, Unostra, in) had slammed the door.
But it was still more than six hours of a meeting began at 11: 00 so that everyone is in agreement and that at 6 p.m. the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that he disrupt the Christmas for years," said Mr BUSSEREAU.
The text provides for a salary increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the road transport and regional and local), and 2.9% for the highest (international).
In hourly rate, for the Summary, "going from 8.72 €9.06.
It is not a great thing, but it is very far, said Patrice Clos (TF).
It will give the order to our supporters that there is no blockages, not blockade of centres of supplies.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot R, president of TLF, has welcomed a "good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the high salaries given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 monthly to the low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) has hailed a" historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has raised "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will help to address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr BUSSEREAU recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employer contributions" has been the subject of a Government amendment to the bill amending finance for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical term".
The signing of TLF provides that the agreement applies in a first step to member companies to this organization, and in a second time, for the entire profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest possible time," said Mr BUSSEREAU.
The opposition of employers' organisations may only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has obliged us to negotiate in an emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to annoy the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, deplored the Unostra.
For your information, the agreement risk "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER A, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue over the weekend, when a meeting Friday to the 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left on their hunger for their application of premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains between 10H00 and 20, on a train on two on the central portion (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central portion.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require travellers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP work to serve the large stores."
The RER A crosses in the Paris conurbation.
The segment RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre at Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak hours, and virtually no paddle in off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there were no crowds on docks, Franciliens is being organised.
And in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, particularly the lack of school students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted "an hour and a half earlier, so be sure to arrive on time".
The Gare Saint-Lazare has not known of saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and the forces of law and order.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, considered to be "meagre" by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, Career Path etc.
This is not what they want drivers, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even its proposals of premium in brackets, has outraged the CGT, noting that management was "not damn to fix a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done".
A new meeting is planned Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What was also say the unions that the company "made fun of users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, who refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros including EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of conditions of work on this line the million daily passengers.
The drivers of RSP, all in the second part of their career, 2.200 2700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish courts dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "centre of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press, the President of the Court Hasim Kilic, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to advise the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 senior party, including its President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MEPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP to obey the directives of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal policy of the rebels of the PKK.
The party maintains, however, that he did "not organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to shrink the support of Kurds to the PKK, and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in the southeast Anatolia, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city of southeast majority inhabited by Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones, with fronds.
A hundred people have also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, Ed) prohibiting a party, "he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
It solves nothing, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the Government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, to a reaction of the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the deadliest of recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, off-limits to visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts in Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of research of armaments secret, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley".
Important sites of production and research of micro- and nanoelectronics.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place of science mehr Licht – with academic institutions, and corporations from the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were meetings and last Wednesday representatives and Zelenograd Riedberg signed a "Memorandum of close collaboration".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Section Chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange
It is a scientific exchange sustainable.
But also of economic relations.
It will allow the companies of FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Conversely the Russian scientists want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat institutes and research companies Soviet famous.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the large firms and Sitronics Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" to weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "City green") takes its name from forested hills in the heart of which the research centres are established.
The project S21: A brake for Stuttgart
Cannot be placed high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than a "new heart of Europe".
If we want. S21, that is far more than the burial of a railway station, a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, chaos in a despairing of shipyards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations, with tracks which ended in town, had a reputation at the time of the relics of the technique of transport of the 19th century that were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – that is what needed to be done.
That is why the stations to disappear: In Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: A train station, which is located approximately halfway on the conquest of the trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head of the line stations no longer pose real problems for the entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However, it is now launching the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new line towards Inter-City Ulm.
The regional and local policies won the day.
The railway company is part, because it is the taxpayer who is the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic, and not the public company.
From the point of view of planning this project is relatively well justified.
There is an urban space which – if the graphs of planners generated by computer – will be very green.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and enlargement of the section are designed for the trafficking of people which was - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth.
At the time, there was no competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more respectful of the environment that by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the project of the Bolzano.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be for other junction points and congestion in the network.
The list of the Department of Transportation said in any sixty large projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built at idle.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 had the effect of a hoof brakes.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the judgment on the airport
The regional Parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government raised the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of the Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition of CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view, the ruling by the Administrative Court and is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the proposed runway aterrissage northwest of the Frankfurt airport was realized.
The authorisation of attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution.
The coalition must have decided for January 4, if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and attempts to put pressure on the government representative for that celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Administrative Tribunal Fédéral in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be considered a failure to a word.
That is darn hard to be allowed to keep its word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir in referring to the FDP ’ s electoral slogan "We want our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch refutes accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel which claims that the Land Government attempts to authorize still night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises."
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "first impression".
It must be that the decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
American banks repay the aid allocated
The large U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury of $45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the rescue plan tarp.
The American TV channel NBC said at a news report that Citigroup was also looking to reimburse the aid received.
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of money, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to the officer and the Regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities to investors, which reported $19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the coffers of the bank that are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the U.S. taxpayers: The injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on the financial markets to be free of the guardianship of the State.
The U.S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion, reported the chain CNBC, quoting the banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they received.
Accelerated Election
Finally it is still spent more quickly than expected.
Barely two weeks after the sacking of the current position of the Editor Nikolaus Brender by the Board of the German channel ZDF, a successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who directs the drafting in Berlin on ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain has not, however, wished to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to pre-empt the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further undermine the steward of ZDF Markus Schächter in cases where the proposal would not be accepted by the Administrative Council.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the closing of the writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of Administration to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender, but this was rejected.
Only 7 Council members had supported the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The dismissal by vote of Brender represented a resounding failure while predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender at his position.
It is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organised a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed Editor is extended, citing the fact that the rate of viewing of news of the ZDF had fallen below Brender.
This is the reason why the protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law which had meddled in the debate, and who felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But this will have been for nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 to Bingen.
He has studied the science-policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in radio body Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first the news magazine "heute-journal" (paper today).
Then his route continues: From 1988 to 1990, he was the assistant editor of the time; then, Washington correspondent in 1991 / 1992, then and in 1998 he was Chief and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of ZDF and leader of the drafting in Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch in the Council of Administration, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Treaty Multi-jurisdictional ZDF so that the staff of the Intendant could not be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to request the removal of politicians, members of the committees overseeing ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had deftly maneuvered to the Administrative Board in criticizing the Commission vehemently in its decision to sack Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the Council of the Authority could elect without being put in the position of being a supporter.
In the representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Clean-up in the university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: At a meeting between Ministers and delegates from the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the conditions of work of students Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to come to the end of their studies.
They are, in particular, to reduce the weight of accordpour reviews: A single exam must allow the closure of the module of study.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure "proportions, realistic and acceptable".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for the vocational Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should not be different rules and regulations of a Land.
Less of reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword: "Étudiabilité."
But for the first time, this expression appears to take a specific meaning.
The accreditation council decided to significantly reduce the number of reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single exam," can be read in a document of 30 pages on the conditions of admission to the university.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of Certification says that by sharply reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop the slippage, which interfered considerably to the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should be, in the future, the decisive criterion for the organization of studies.
The modules like the bottom should be carefully examined to see if it can not avoid this smothering sensation that are sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge on RAID Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new rules will be access to new university but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must "be re-certified every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 accreditation agencies competent in the whole Federal territory who depend on the accreditation council created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of reviews not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and graduate schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land have agreed to grant more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as the offices of reviews and the Department of International Relations
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education establishments.
After that it will not spend more than a single review to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "étudiabilité" of all university will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again debated the question of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont appreciated but there have been some criticisms.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist students indicated that it would like the organization of educational policy does not happen in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and Heads of universities.
After the strike, the students as people concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future of higher education graduates received the support of the President of the delegates from the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a project of reform.
The union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn does not go far enough. It calls for the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor degree to enroll in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller, a member of the Steering Committee of the GEW asks that the Länder ensure students Bachelor of today, that tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
By contrast, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility of easing the access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins the poet Werner Söllner, in which he dealt with in snippets of sentences disturbing, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but has lost at the same time its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he took the highly coveted chair of poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002, he is the Director of the forum of literature of Hesse, to the house of artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He has done a lot of him in circles not literary last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he admitted to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate police policy.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language in conjunction with some of the participants.
The trials of enrolment had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, therefore, concludes Söllner "someone who has not sufficiently resisted aversive intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (MI Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and his literary run-ins with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case which clearly shows the pitfalls and baseness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say with the current state of knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In its own Securitate file, MI Walter played a role, ensures the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had interceded in its favour.
"It could draw from all difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Moralde Markel has felt the need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper, "Die Zeit," after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
We can assume that the victims have made speculation and may have guessed what actual names hid last names of borrowings Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike Germany, where between the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been repeatedly frustrated and depressed in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution Birthler was created to work to the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of files rather has dragged on since.
Since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, was expressed in a very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end we had interviewed only once.
The infamy of power was thought to be able to speak here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many questions are inevitably the case Söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Which has been despoiled? The weighted response from listeners, the admission of Söllner suggest that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
In the Champions League up-and-down
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot four pins from any right of a Christmas party sexy, on which the manufacturer of sports articles had spread its goods when the new coach BFV Christian Gross, pressed the midnight shift in a Mercedes C Class, that he had just called, a plastic bag of orange supplier to the hand.
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, was driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our peers could take the wheel – he had not drunk alcohol, and he was not drunk happiness.
He had spent an evening pleasant but tomorrow it would resume work.
As it is now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland was to hire three days earlier were clear: "We have achieved the eighth of final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal battle for not going back".
The "heavy work" we expected Sunday.
Here, it is repeated in Mainz, the results of the Champions League.
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three goals of expeditious Marica (5.), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
The drawing fate
The eighth final of the Champions League (go game. 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / return match. 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn at random on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the entry of the successor of fulminant Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate who had brought luck, who had sent to professionals in Stuttgart destabilized, highly motivated and fun to play.
I was to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I told them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" – Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais did more with the trainer Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter - Babbel, "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things you never would have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, after weeks break for injury, advanced to the ranks of the best player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "wind" and the working method of the new leader: "Someone who goes to the action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The BFV Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, BFV Stuttgart has need of tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager is careful not to overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests from Romania.
They had also won in Glasgow before they have had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0: 4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season, but there were others who were still far off.
We have not yet turned the corner difficult.
That Heldt on the day of its 40th anniversary did not have the heart to make the party, even after the first victory at home for three months, the events of the weekend that a television interview goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was bouncing back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others and not Jens, stymied Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the management of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change coaches under the pressure of pubertal fans.
Lehmann had seen also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the games has been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann was "marked by a pure selfishness" kicked Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalie.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two their forties.
In any cast, they agreed to all the rest, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation of sport and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a large part in the success" replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the plastic bag responded.
World championship heavy
Hot combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the Challenger caused constantly verbally and gestural expression the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of the world heavyweight champion after the version of the WBC federation.
The unanimity of judges it imposed on points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retained his title of the world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that Saturday night the champion of 38 years, had won a victory points to the unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko with honour defends his title since its Comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it has not passed the KB.
Klitschko, sneaked 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice its defeat because of injuries.
The Challenger Johnson has accepted its first defeat in the 24th combat.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko has mainly wanted to dictate the fight, the top of his 2.02 metres, by his against the left.
Johnson, of 11 centimetres smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era of Klitschko, managed to avoid hitting champion, and Klitschko empéchant bring into its game against right detrimental.
Johnson, too passive in action for a Challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and deeds its shots reached only very rarely the champion.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of the 12 rounds.
The Challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital, Switzerland before the battle.
He insulta Klitschko was a "villain" zombie "is not really capable".
During the weighing Friday, the champion could not prevent cause Johnson in him doing his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since the Comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko is taxed again at its fourth combat since its Comeback October 11, 2008
After a pause of almost four years ago, he was beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "its" WBC belt that he had previously surrender without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez in Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola the USA.
"I just took a blow in this fight and I am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his rapid return on the ring.
Her dream is to try to bring in the family, the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is the IBF and WBO champion federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who, with the great détroné Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko, who was to be held in September.
It would appear that his promotion company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack the opposition: The head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD party and The Left Party (Die Linke) ask the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After a review of the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two tanker trucks last September, said the leader of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information chain ARD Tagesschau "(the newspaper of 8 p.m.).
Clearly, this means that he has lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the contents of the report available to NATO and which has been read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
After the inquiry report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike, which was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to rule as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin, and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted killings is part of the Government / Afghan policy if the Chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The spokesman of the Government categorically rejects the criticism.
The Chancery has not in any way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, the votes were being increasingly strong to express doutesquant real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department.
According to information SPIEGEL newspaper, the information that they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some details troublesome.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggests, however, that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
"The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have meanwhile requested in a letter of clarification of the facts.
Until now, it has not received a response
Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on the charges and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal Parliament that was going to be the next Wednesday to render the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mental patients, or under the influence of the drug, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms clouded, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the state of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in our western world to be mad or drugged, or at least be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: It is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses, painting pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, can take various forms, in the best of cases you call it visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect is distinguished, visions of the mystique Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the latter statements of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmitter in the brain - first dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Hallucinations complexes and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great similarity between the madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, sensory illusions and delusions of the".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a character in a comic.
His body is in two dimensions to the garish colours.
The attraction of land has more power over him, there is the wave of the ceiling.
He feels a coup.
Behind him creatures of devil winged, grimaçantes, mouth bloodied, showing the teeth.
They continue, give him kicking with heavy boots ablaze, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
A thundering voice, nasty, howl, leaving the walls and the radio.
It can no longer tolerate these voices who insult and humiliate them.
Henning T. rip two cables of his stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He goes on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck.
It jumps.
The loop.
That this will be a lesson, the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum. "Goes in a clinic and treat fais-toi!"
Today Henning T. was 40 years he has lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It has been triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: Psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, furthermore it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I lived fears terrible and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics that is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, individuals can no longer be the difference between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of "hyper arousal, which they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voice command, who comment on or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned may not make the distinction between the large and the small, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned in the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks in a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry CHU Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, all a meaning centred on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is a dream, overcome by events and may not act on them active way.
This is the reason why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
The experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory structure and space to the reality that is seen during the psychosis, is basically maintained".
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived in a real framework.
Why our brain doing these kinds of antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are tiny brain lesions.
It is assumed that the maturation of neurons in the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained, it is the way the anomaly of the neural system occurs and the fact that it is not seen for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger psychosis, however, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heated.
This is crazy, "said Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, that suffer from hallucinations and psychotic their take drugs expensive to dispose of it, while others buy expensive drugs for it.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and the phenomena of images illusory: Last year he has published his findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head."
The hallucinations are definitely part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
They include psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also migraine headaches, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy individuals is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that deal with the sensory perceptions are hyperactives or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the heartbreak of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having made at least once in their life experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and she goes to the school.
A young girl to do normal to tell the truth.
If there was not the images and voices.
During the recess, sometimes a young boy, thin, with long hair chestnut, to address the floor.
When she meets his comrades the watch, surprised – nobody sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this is a shy girl dreaming lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hear and see this boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
It may even collect his presence temporarily.
It is a good feeling, she found this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, asks sometimes does.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances, in general, are frightening.
Often the visions are burdensome.
When it is in the classroom, sometimes it can follow the course because the teacher is just being present a new student in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly trying to explain the equations in Table.
The night appearances, in general, are frightening.
When, in the darkness of his bedroom, it expects sleep that came too little and too late, it often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on his arms and legs are before his eyes open or closed.
Let me alone, shouts to these creatures.
It does not speak neither his parents nor his friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. has now 20 years.
She had her car last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since she came in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or did not sufficiently of stimulation, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough, ensures that there is the animation.
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played all alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Dad, since it was in age to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the hallucinations visual and acoustic, and for the actual sounds impressions and, therefore, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. "Each experience," according to Kasten "took place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, dreams at night are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and physician in chief of the psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious disease, painful, but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called experience oniroïde, a particular form of the amendment of the conscience awakened by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves which are perceived as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of arousal.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a traumatic or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients who polyradiculopathie fully aware, experience paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total disability and sustainable move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by its own imaginary world who is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of intensive methods and interpretation, in a situation itself intolerable, organizational capacity that is given to us, the men, not to sink into the abyss of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of Heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
He was 49 years, when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; during that time, her body was sentenced to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunged into a world that has been created from scratch, site visit foreign, travel in time. He sees himself as an old man in a sanatorium in bed rail, a robot at his bedside care on her health.
He lived in the middle ages among nobles who manufacture of drugs of blood.
He was abducted by a Greek motorbike which takes in his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the FIRN Alps and meeting a Korean mafioso.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
To Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, "he wrote in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed, even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience to burst the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions oniroïdes, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how our representations of external reality are fragile, even in a state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
27 years ago, children will be the result of the house of editions.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: More long-term, Hubert Burda wishes that his two children use the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - A long-term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit 27 years and are firmly committed to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise.
It will also see if they are able.
We cannot impose its children to 7500 collaborators without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it.
This démolirait children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President and CEO in January, and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, is a member of the Board since 1999.
First, it was responsible for the technology sector.
He subsequently held the Treasury sector it is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
For the first time, this is not a member of the family which is at the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son, Felix, which would today 42 years, died some years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the link the next 10 to 15 years "
Burda said that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in the families who are left to lead by one bulimia of capital, that have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb still higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never had rêvede global power, Burda said.
I am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as the country could be Springer, and I do not intend to be part of these leagues international as the Time, these firms have taken too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see certain type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He took advantage of its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek offers a price and a monthly subscription very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: One designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life, to six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited its grand-frère American, but includes a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphone already know what represents the waiving of the data when it crosses a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the (or a Wi-Fi connection of Fon) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
Reminders of the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while he has no Wi-Fi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without a subscription and without boat.
It is a device connected and paying on its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: A purchase option with access to life as the Peek is already in the United States.
I do not want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that it is a more fair to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of the color, it has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him for the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: The remission in Oslo Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model in these two occasions: In addition to their colour institute, a yellow to green with bright, both times, the dress consisted of three parts: The dress, the jacket and the mantle, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
Although a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States to follow in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same held.
But the tissue in which are cut both sets them very different.
If for the inauguration of a thick lace, in contrast, she was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: Shoes to heel means for the first time, and a similar model, but walleye, this time.
The headgear has also changed: The hair are now records when it was released last time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This shows the study "Fertility and professional career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75 percent of working mothers saw their professional career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not, and the type of job.
Those who did not work outside the home, working part-time or have a stable work, start earlier in the couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry in life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged between 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives for it, which led to push the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised considerable influence maternity, but less than the start date of common life, "explains the researcher CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that is widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have some elementary and higher, respectively were first-time mothers to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another is also discrimination between women, according to their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary school marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with higher average level studies or reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also the is

Vincent manual offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 30 "X-rays" writers who have crossed a literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It is not the gender predictable and apprehended (summary sketch, and life), but in seeking something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent saves nor fearfulness nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and reviews.
I leave you here a few snapshots.

On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, Christian allegory, he wrote that he had in the blood, not in the head between the powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic wit, devoid of meaning, as the blade of the knife has nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman a passion that lasted 13 years, in the flesh, which he emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a privilege spiritual, which was to reach the sky by the road to PERDITION."
On James Joyce's "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of eight thousand metres world literature, that he must climb the north face, on which the best climbers dropping still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
By himself, he said that he was the heir of a landowner in the county, and other times it was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams of greatness. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the cry belies pushed from a bridge by the character of Munch to bring its echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the escape of himself and citing the fact with a speech violent maggots."

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved from the APS and not weighing more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they both assenèrent kicking the dog who left seriously injured.
Our indignation is huge because we do not see this as there are fun to attack a defenceless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and who, when she iniuria these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person lower than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the police station in the neighbourhood, even if we doubt it much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among the young, for they find amusing to mistreat a defenceless animal which gives us love, friendship and takes us company.
We do not know where is the good education and the respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, ensembles for helmet
The manufacturer of tires Michelin, in collaboration with the Foundation for the Spaniard Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, primarily among motorcyclists younger, as indicated today the two structures.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in case of accidents in two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, "which goes beyond the design and manufacturing of products always safer" and said it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign of helmets in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be," will have a first phase, during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles beginning to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers' trade union and Ganvam Anfac, the dealers.
It is, however, to qualify the good news, since the reference for the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during those 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles which fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, vans and light trucks lightweight chassis) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that most affect their application have not so far been dispelled. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to restrictions involved by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation and the difference of passenger vehicles, the aid to the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, were reminded again the need for the administration of attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides one year 2010 similar to that which ends, for which she calculates a fall of sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now mandatory
As has occurred with the system of anti-lock brakes (ABS) and as it will take place with the ESP stability control systems to support emergency braking will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory in passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up to the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident was not able to build on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of assistance in revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent systems of emergency braking: It calculates that a disaster on four, with casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, increasing the pressure on the pedal, if this is necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors pushes until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva model would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 – after Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to the workers and the governments of countries where the factories are located, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer in order to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch-based manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group converg becomes more important.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The wheel of the Porsche BOXSTER Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewelry, engineers are parties of the Porsche BOXSTER S and succeeded to the thinning of nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof which has been replaced by a static roof manual, to reduce 21 kilos, use of aluminum doors as the WG3, other 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank of 64 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, climbing bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system CDR-30, earning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes by door handles in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box PDK double clutch, the test was carried out on a model to manual transmission of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads in California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour cannot be qualified as beyond reproach.
Decrease the weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: It was a long time that we had not tested a model also small and light, at the same time, all the guarantees of security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for the time required, until we ask of sprinter, to curtail, recover and grow back its engine …
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also specifies that communicative, the car will do what will indicate our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
His engine to
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the BOXSTER S) is especially successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either to the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The paving of roads that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence on the entire journey, while some turns we found the ice in the morning and gravels, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more entertaining to drive and is much more than a simple amendment of the BOXSTER S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon Coco Cocoon and occasional starlette parades of the house, the singer has her face of bad girl with as much capacity as its Chanel bags.

The Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a resounding triumph at 91-82 during his visit on the ground hard Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is located in the head of his group, after the grand spectacle of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets at three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The team of Vitoria was able to fill absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points, largely determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked since the perimeter, foreshadowed that they had jumped on the ground with Israeli wrists hot.
FRANÇAIS and Teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 final of first quarters.
The second quarters was in the same tone, but the team of Alava has chosen the game inside of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause of return to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best player of his team, with 13 points, while the "least six" evaluation of Splitter foreshadowing that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that it does not win so easily on their land, and thanks to the "hand of Elias," they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to take the yellow advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to take appropriate actions to take the air, and it is at this point that the gun Teletovic Mirza, who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the assistance of English and Ribas gave the meter, a score reassuring (54-67), and that the premises were able to increase at the end of the third quarters (57-67).
The team of Avala came out to play everything on the line in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) notice that they would get their person what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, including Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, did not résignèrent and tried to support since the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players from Ivanovic did not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80-85), the party was already performed and the victory was outside Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent the UNICAJA to battle
The UNICAJA lost loudly in Greece with Olympiacos and has transferred, the head of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players of the UNICAJA, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the flag of the Peace and Friendship nor by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarters, has helped make the dream Andalusian. An aggressive defense and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos has been surprised by the intensity of the UNICAJA, although the arsenal of the local team with the game within Bourousis, and Vujcic Schortsanitis, has helped to overthrow the 946 score in the 13th minute, when an action, a scuffle between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began to operate in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury the pivot English Joel Freeland and the three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the UNICAJA.
The players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their baskets with three points, dug a 44-32 advantage, in the nineteenth minute.
A rebound impossible
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos, who, despite the losses, 19, was higher and arrived even to match the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, rocking the head of the group.
The UNICAJA trying to overcome the absences and the final exit the pivot Scotland's Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the UNICAJA, thanks to his organization, to baskets to three points of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57 in the 31st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos showed implacable when the players were under pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The pivot Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to pull the score to 81-62, in the 37th minute, and the UNICAJA engagements, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ’ affaires of the Embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"It is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination."
The chain has also cited the former agent, who has confirmed its intention that leave the embassy before the end of the deadline established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically, with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya has ensured that he would stay in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled policy that would impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very
After days roses since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty arises there again, which is not surprising, since it is their natural state, in an environment where the officers take decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks in order to stabilize markets was to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity rates close to zero, so that financial institutions to buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets were virtually finalised, and without questioning their political maverick of liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week.
Accordingly, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing an inversely to the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the awards and the differences in the obligations of companies increase again, although they remain very remote and occultism levels that they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then its Standard & Poor threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who tried to provoke a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of derivatives of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what he should do is impose a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen in the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovered the ruse.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a non respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What is logical, it is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and make its citizens co-leads the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of standardization of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in senior positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences of public debt increases to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn not to worry.
If the differences in Europe decreased and that our people continued to increase, it would be a risk of idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our forward-looking indicators require most services studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who returned to the office with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has the air of an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for the moment "caution is the mother of safety".
Connected sectors
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press that he had raised before the Subcommittee, in camera.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain has need to invest 50 000 million euros in 2020 and 60 000 million between that date and 2030, where nuclear plants now in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not rise to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be used to increase production capacity, but distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses on both gas power plants to coal, with recovery mechanisms of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW are necessary, with other "energies of support".
Galán, who believes that the draft Act of sustainable economy that the government has approved is in line with what the company calls did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the use of coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
According to him, there was "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the measures "point", as has described the chairman of Iberdrola.
Nevertheless, Galán believes that investment decisions, while they are in the long term, should start to be taken, because they take some time before they reach their maturity and that a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial won the market of the handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on earth, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are part of the most important.
The agreement, including the economic terms were not disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for collaboration to create the Centre for innovation in intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance provides for a $20 million investment until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will conduct research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for his first motorway concession in Australia, market on which she is already working as a company of energy and water.
The site is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and dealer highways.
The mayor of the city wants to have it for the end of 2014.
After choosing the public / private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, in the context of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of bids in May, the planned investment amounted to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase face three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers Australian, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of underground work.
Against the team of Acciona, shoe the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British firm Laing O'Rourke, the Australian manager infrastructure and Transfield French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, which has in turn the participation of GBA), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises major shipyards and privatisation, but there is a big challenge, if this is through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the businesses and Hochtief Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their references Asian, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
GBA is just win a place on this market by its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets millionaires,
Acciona on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity energy supplier and in the area of the desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter markets in the construction and management of infrastructure.

A fine of $63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of 63 million euros to France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region in the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile telephony through the signing of exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers in the margin of the regulation.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467,4 million, which puts them in the third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362.5 million euros to 105 teams (including 12) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to the information from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have been well served at this distribution.
The club was the third of the continent to receive the most money for his participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, currently taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that, in addition, billed the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost before the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is that the third country, in respect of the money generated by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England and Germany two).
The distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocation of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413,1 million to fixed payments: Each of the 20 clubs who have participated in the games classification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in more than 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths perceive final three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter final reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will receive each 4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, to 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed $2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variables payments, which are enshrined 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the value of each market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four grizzly.
The champion the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid based on the number of matches played during the edition of the year.
Nueva Rumasa provides EUR 61 million to 29.9% of SOS.
The group Nueva Rumasa listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of SOS.

In the meantime, SOS continues the restructuring of its direction.
In an attempt to remain outside any bids and the coming and going of its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that in fact the first woman to occupy a position in the company.
It is a newly created position that will directly depend on the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle to the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million SOS to companies of Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months SOS reveals new embezzlement of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the JCC and UNICAJA) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, garages automobiles are not the only winners.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are reduced to a parking garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of the parts and labor can be a long and complex process.
To calculate the cost of a repair between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
In contrast, with the assistance of computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by the manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, Solera North American group, is the company leader; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the quantity of data continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, motors and variants were launched during the three previous years.
When a new car on the market, these companies set to work.
It is a very hard work, because it requires cataloguing each thousand parts of the vehicle and its price.
In addition, it establishes a graphic image "smart" of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
It is a model sold heavily, the work may be ready in a week if the process is moving very quickly.
It is a little car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides comprehensive information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
One of the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
Concerning the vehicles in circulation, the figure is 99%.
To perform the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
Here, more than a hundred technicians (in general experts in mechanical) work simultaneously on three screens of computers.
Audatex invests each year 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and propose various products.
The most common application for the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are also tools for the management of pieces of breaks or to calculate the residual value or a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not in our country, but it is in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can bring to professionals in the sector.
This company offers 10 different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for assessment of claims, intended to experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, industrial vehicles, light and heavy.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the time to repair estimates by the manufacturer or the scales of paint.
This tool is bought in terms of its use, for each estimate.
The largest cost is $5.75 euros, for customers who use little, up to 10 times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which he came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and is a AudaSubastas server open to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows them to bid on vehicles reported wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, analyses géo-démographiques or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific mark went to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to documents, price and time officials of the manufacturer.
GT Motive is a company of the group Einsa, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for disaster assessment, failures or car maintenance.
The guide GT evaluation is a product of historical reference on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and has a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began the process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and is located in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of its turnover is done in Europe and in the rest of the world, and the remaining 38 per cent in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33 000 garages, including 3 000 are in Spain.
The turnover of global Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will collect $19.1 million, or 7.2 per cent more than last year.
In 2005, the group Solera was traded 1 000 million, today, its shares are valued at a total of 2 400 million.
Since 2007, he is on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the benchmark Standard & Poor's.
Internet auction of cars rugged
Last October, the group has bought Solera Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles evacuees.
The operation has involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its clients, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This service estimate and sale is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, leasing companies, garages, Woodcock and professional salespeople who must be registered before starting to conduct operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its major markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3 000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new advertisements are published every day.
Under Spanish law, a car with the chassis number was withdrawn can no longer move, but on the other hand, some parts which are not damaged can be used as replacement parts.
The cars of collection can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn after complicated procedures.
Description of garage in four stages
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user obtains an estimate in only four steps: Identify the vehicle, seek the spares, create a quotation and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the oldest professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain motorcycles 137, 78 44 vans and trucks.
Of course, for use, a computer and an Internet connection is required.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image of the actual model in question is then it selects the necessary part.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, increases or reductions, then he can print the specifications for the client.
AudaTaller is not a tool to estimate as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that intended to garages does not include the time of manpower estimated.
The cost of using this tool to the garage is 350 euros per year, which may be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that the mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turn to see the inner.
