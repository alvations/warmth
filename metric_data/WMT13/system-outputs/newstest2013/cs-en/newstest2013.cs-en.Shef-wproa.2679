The Republican Party against Obama ’ s re-election
Republican leaders justify its policy of the necessity of the fight against the electoral fraud.
Brennanovo Centre, such a scam calls for a myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people who die following intervention by lightning.
Republican lawyers, after all, over the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: this new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine America ’ s democratic system.
Unlike Canada have in the US responsibility for the organisation of the federal election of individual states.
And, in this spirit of the majority of the American governments from 2009 enunciates the new laws that make the process of elections, or the minutes in the electoral list.
This phenomenon has noted the boom after the elections in November 2010, during which more 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, it was only for 2011 submitted 180 proposals law restricting suffrage in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require that voters tabled identity cards with photographs and proof of the American state of citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, zneplatňují the right to be on the list of the voters in the day of the elections and odnímají electoral the right of citizens, with a criminal.
Before the elections in 2006 for the voters did not require the submission of půkazu identity with photographs no US state.
The first country that this request was introduced, Indiana.
Constitutionality indianského law has confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.
Republican authorities spěchaly with the extension of this procedure and to other States.
Over the last two years to support the proposals of such laws in 34 States in order to force the voters, to give s identity card with photographs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebeku do not have the American citizens universal identity cards, such as health insurance card.
In fact, do not own the 11% of US citizens, i.e., 21 million people in the age of allowing us to vote no identification with photographs, issued by the government by their state.
Furthermore, there is no such a card identity about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the purchase of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young, members of minorities, and those with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans 15% of people with an income below 35 000 dollars; 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters in the age of 18 to 29 years therefore does not have the desired identity cards with photographs.
And this is not all.
Students who are as voters known for their by shifting to democratic candidates are not in several States entitled to use their identity cards with photographs on display their school.
On the other hand, the same States allow the Members of the hunting or fishing clubs, who elect rather Republican candidates card exposed to these clubs in the elections to use.
In 2004, no state at the elections did not require proof of citizenship.
The first such a requirement to introduce Arizona.
Since the year 2011 adopted around 12 States laws, which sets out the obligations of the electorate demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously to reduce the number of votes from hispánské minorities.
In fact, be noted that two of the three Hispanic prefer a democratic party.
Republican legislators in 2011 support in the eight States laws that abolishing the Minutes of the voters in the day of the elections.
Moreover, limit the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to the voters who want to go.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004, have helped the campaign for the Minutes of the electorate to zaregistrování around 10 million people.
The measures adopted after 2009 but has caused the decline in adding new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006.
Republican legislators, in the other five States adopt laws aimed at reducing the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were poor African-Americans 33% of voters who elected in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.
Among Hispanic was the case as well.
Were only 11% of all of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens of the voters in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who were 76% of all of the voters were only 46% of voters who elected in advance.
Against the approval of the laws, which restrict the registration of the electorate, of course, very strongly supported democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors blocked its veto of a few of the proposals of the laws.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.
Damage is partly managed to reduce them.
For example, the laws requiring the submission of the identity card with photographs taken only 16 of the 34 States.
The newly established rules, however, entirely undeniably will make it more difficult in 2012, the performance of the voting rights.
Democratic critics are talking, above all, about bias of the laws and they are seen as an obvious attempt to influence the election results in 2012 in key States.
The report Brennanova centre of the year 2011 shows that States, where these laws have been approved, represent 171 of 270 votes in the College necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already today: the new provisions will have an adverse impact on the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine America ’ s democratic system.
The detection prostate cancer: to go through the investigation or not?
The test PSA can sometimes wrong results that have been negative or even incorrectly positive, which has led to unnecessary medical zákrokům.
All this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already so reluctant to the investigation of all to go.
To be investigated or not?
We have asked for the opinion of the two experts.
In the studies carried out in the US has shown a high level of contamination between testovanými groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Other studies, this time the European considered different mortality between patients who are running the investigation, and those who did not go to them.
This study also proved after 12letém distance that those who do not go on the investigation, have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastáz.
I therefore commend investigation from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your relatives had a direct prostate cancer.
More men are also the Afro-American of origin.
The key is to take the right decision, as soon as cancer is disclosed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are neutral.
It is therefore necessary to explain to the patient rightly peace the dangers of its kind of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which has in the long term, the impact on the life, and to focus in these cases rather on the active supervision of the disease.
Today, a number of men, which has been diagnosed with cancer, cure, as their kind of cancer is not an aggressive and does not compromise is to life.
We will propose them rather the implementation of the active oversight and in the case of taxes disease offering the treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision we lay down criteria, which help in the decision-making process that kind of cure and which do not.
Yet I therefore recommend investigation to go through.
It is important but to go through the interview with a doctor and to establish whether it is appropriate to undergo an investigation or not.
In cooperation with the International urologickou companies a movement Movember instrument that allows assess for and against in connection with scrutiny PSA.

The prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for the prevention of cancer.
In spite of the progress in research seems to be the best way to reduce the risks of diseases the adoption of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that, if all of a healthy eating and not enough hýbali, one could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.
'If all stop smoking, this figure would have risen by at least 50%,' underlines the André Beaulieu, the spokesman for the Canadian companies for cancer research.
By contrast, it is estimated that around 10% of cancer is causing the inheritance.
A percentage of also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, although the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes it is worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also risk factor for several other.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
It is now in the 'Once Quebeku 1.5 million smokers,' is dismissive spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker to stop smoking is declining, the risk of cancer deaths by half.
Mass
Tělnatost and obesity are under the SCC over and other risk factor for the incidence of diseases.
Increasing the risk of breast cancer and colorectal cancers, jícnu, slinivky and the uterus.
'In the research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer,' gives the report.
Nutrition
These organisations also recommends to reduce the red meat consumption.
In too high consumption can lead to increased risk of kolorektální of cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid and for sausages, for which the same is true.
The preservation of meat uzením, sušením or solením can lead to the creation of carcinogenic substances.
'Can cause damage to cells organism and lead to the development of cancer,' gives the report.
Vitamins
In recent times, the various scientists focus on the link between vitamínovými supplements and cancer.
Research, however, have so far brought clear conclusions.
A study to vitamín E are under the SCC over and contradictory.
Although, according to one of them will be a reduction in risks prostate cancer, other studies talk more about the increase.
Neither the effect of vitamin D Group to cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how it is important to talk about their concerns and precedentech of families with his doctor.
'to submit to investigate the does not mean that you will have the cancer of the'.
Higgsův boson examined
The communication on the likely discovery Higgsova bosonu caused last summer justified a stir.
There is the view that this boson participate in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And it is the last particle, whose existence is the standard model - the best of our or 'least bad' explanations of nature and the behaviour of the matter - but which has not empirically observed.
Between the physics, however, there is still 100% certainty that it is about Higgsův boson.
In any doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to Higgsovu bosonu, as are prefigured the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical Congress in Kyoto, but rather the absence of even all the data in order to have an absolute certainty.
However, suppose that it is about Higgsův boson, because the risks of error seems to be a small, and let us look at what it is.
In this world is quite obvious law, according to which the two things cannot occur in the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard on this, otherwise, ublížíte.
Although it is very strange world částicová physics, it also shows that it is a similar law: Pauliho exclusion the principle according to which they cannot two particles take the same room in the same time, if they are in the same 'kvantovém the state of the' - this' state 'roughly speaking creates some of their characteristics.
Further fyzikové particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently respect Pauli principles.
And, at the other, the move bosony, podlí anarchists, who are contemptuous nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can easily be at the same place at the same time.
These bosony also divided into two groups in the equipment (incidentally, which is absolutely wonderful) The Particle Adventure, in laboratories Berkeley: mesony that we leave unheeded, and 'the particles', which is spreading the major natural forces and with which it is probably Higgsův boson somehow spřízněn.
However, it should be to say that these bosony are not as exotic that, as it would be possible to believe.
If you read the article, it is thanks to the bosonu with an unusual banalitou: the photon, or 'particle light', which is' a vector of 'electromagnetic forces.
When the particles with electric nábojem accelerate or to change its direction, 'to frustrate the' the electromagnetic fields in this particular point, just as oblázek hozený in the pond.
From this' inconvenience 'a electromagnetic wave of (light, infračervené or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave of is nothing other than fotonem - and therefore one of the bosonů,' of the forces'.
A more stable fields
It is also with Higgsovým bosonem, only that, 'disturb' is to be other fields, Higgsovo fields that this boson appeared.
This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excitaci it is necessary to achieve a very high energy values, as with the frozen levels pond, already zčeří only a lot of great balvan.
For this reason, it is to be used as a huge urychlovač part as urychlovač in a laboratory CERN - great hadronový urychlovač the friendly ties is circle with constituency 27 km! - in order to develop a energy.
The analogy with electromagnetic field, we again suited to clarify the relationship between Higgsem and the matter.
With electromagnetic field are not responding, all of particles even all materials.
Some, such as magnets, doing so, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be itself to keep on ledničce.
And the same is true that, with all the particles are not responding Higgsovým field: those that do so, are a matter, while others (such as foton, let us look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs Nováková asks what all of these studies are what 'will provide'?
In terms of science is a confirmation of the standard model (SM), which allows fyzikům to examining any inconsistency between overhead and forecasts SM.
Moreover, many physicists literally wishes to have managed to find them, because any difference could open the area of 'new physics' and to close some of the loopholes in the model.
It is necessary to state that the model is still huge shortcomings there is no clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of the space of matter (in turn ouha!).
Facilities CERN, however, until now, there is such contradictions.
Responses
Response of these research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs Novákových very hard to predict, however, it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.
Hleďte: at the beginning of the 1960 ’ s not as pioneers Bellových laboratories and the notion of the revolution, for their work.
Assuming the scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in Bell Labs, where a laser in 1960, invented on, and which formed the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulzní) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially regarded as a 'toy to laborky'.
Just imagine...
And in addition, the application of the result of all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a little light snímač in 1969, during its work aimed at optiku.
This snímač, although Boyle initially not the case at all neplánoval, now serve as' an eye 'all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Peace Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of around LHC we urgently need to change the life, however, this means that one really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to go from life... | Le Devoir
Through its the Commission for decent dying the Quebek recently involved in the sensitive issues relating to the end of life.
The debate should shortly to continue and, at the same time, it is about the proposal of the law.
In this crucial area still a lot of work remains to be done.
Magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago they Mr 1 even yourself in his home in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which it had, provide two-year reprieve.
'giving me five years of life and it is now seven,' says without emotion, on his bed in the House for palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, where he came here in the previous day.
'It is still the shock, on this, you cannot to prepare,' gives.
The disease has done its work: the enormous weakness allow it to itself to no or only himself Fed.
Resignedly looks at home and eating well breakfast agrees that it is to help their food.
It is a bold and even the smiles, talks with unknown, who a stop, brings him medicines, offer koupel.
The courage to ordinary death.
'My the greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhoea, one of them,' has entrusted me with.
A few hours later found a team of doctors to his problem cure.
'In the life of one teaches that chlapi močí standing ovation,' tells Pierre Brodeur, the psychologist in equipment Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage of the child, for some people unacceptable humiliation.
'depends on the capacities of a person's', whether a return to adopt, says the psychologist.
The view of many people, which deal with palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place at the heart of the kind of return.
Patients who succeed in the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois all, are suffering from cancer.
Their forecast is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage of them the team of doctors and nurses who care for them, it does not provide so-called '' medical care.
In the case of Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst concern to die 'on choking in full knowledge of the'.
The disease but allow me to discover their children.
'My worthy of children,' gives.
'In life I do not have no wish,' says, and then svolí to it are risking a respirator.
Yet even enjoy in the coming days at the last visit to son from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with the group of volunteers provides care about the body with the help of nutrition.
This is the palliative care, which is, if we cannot do anything else.
To death was more comfortable.
In one Québeku it seems to bed palliative care to 11 700 people.
This is very little, if we consider that all one umřeme.
Here life continues in the optimum conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martelová, one of the female doctors in the home.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, can be provided with, for example, the dose brandy or Pepsi, according to the liking.
Diabetici we no longer need to control the level of sugar.
And death is, part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening were beer Mr X, which later in the night he died.
This morning dopije beer his son in honour of the late father.
'Pomáháme patients as well as their loved ones,' tells Nathalie Savardová, the head of care services.
In the home Victor-Gadbois go days ago one for the second, but like the other.
In addition to třiadevadesátiletého man who, enjoying of the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on polštářích, while připíjejí him on his honor, die tragically šestatřicetiletý man, surrounded by their parents, a woman and two young children, after all options are to survive.
'For a half years, there is always three to five nets, which are intended for people with cancer in the 45 years,' tells with the concerns Dr Christiane Martelová.
53% of patients who in the home Victor-Gadbois come here, from their homes, 47%, from the hospitals.
Problems with the approach to the palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to a palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to mitigate the suffering, when ill will come into the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or a care home.
And several organisations, for example, the home Victor-Gadbois and Society of domestic palliative treatments the Grand Montréal, specialised more or less exclusively on care by onkologickým patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebeku leads to many doctors specialising in palliative care worried about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed by the leaders in the area of palliative treatments, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which show its opposition to such an initiative.
According to doktorky Christiane Martelové quebecký the health system is not sufficiently efficient, to ensure access for all people for the quality of the palliative care, before we can agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
As the saying, has recently experienced pacientku, which spent 14 days in the throes of the huge without anyone has made the necessary steps to be relieved.
Fears that patients do not ask for the killing of this reason that they do not receive appropriate care.
The same time, and that many onkologů takes care of their patients until the last moments without regard to the unfavourable prognosis.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové have already been completely abandoned the minimum, when the hard chemotherapy.
When I say that their onkoložce with treatment, I replied that regrets the fact that I cease to fight, tells us.
While I said, that it is the end of the!
There is not omnipotent care
Dr Martelová is estimated that 90% of people who wish to die, thanks to its ošetřujícím doctors for the fact that their wishes nevyplnili if their team palliative píče alleviate the pain.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, Director for the palliative care in the Society for domestic palliative care the Grand Montréal, patients are preventing the treatment of 8% of cases.
At the end of the life often doctors use palliative tranquilizers, which the patient to sleep until demise, whether by fits and starts or whether they be him tranquilizers dosed permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not see this part of the suffering.
The patient, which we are not of pain, will have greater access to the paliativním sedativům.
Sick, which is not provided a sedative, they say always the same: 'I want to die'.
But this does not always necessarily mean 'I want you to have given me euthanasia', this means more 'I would like to get rid of pain'.
The implementation of this account, allow the grant for journalists from the Canadian a Constitution for research in the health sector.
Large-scale housing scandals in Quebeku
Officials of routes, entrepreneurs in the construction sector and public work, lobbyists political parties and experts on the Italian mafia still tell what they know about the amazing 'system', which combine the construction sector, bureaucrats, politicians, trade unionists and mafiáni.
This' industry 'came quebecké taxpayers very costly, in particular, between 1990 and 2000.
'It is interesting how the system crumbled since we adopted the essential measures,' says ironically, Jacques Duchesneau quebecký Member and the former head of the police in Montreal.
It took place in 2011, the scandal on the basis of sound investigations aimed at the misappropriation of funds in connection with the treaties on the roads in Quebeku that the liberal quebecký Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long last.
'Duchesneauova report' has confirmed a direct link between industry, the murky financing parties and the corruption of officials.
'For from the beginning of the investigations in 2010,' says, 'save only the Ministry of transport on the procurement $1 billion,' if some people keep a tight rein on his instincts to share them!
'Charbonneauova Commission has already led to the demise of two mayors,' gives with the hope that it can be 'rozkrýt lstivost some people'.
The permanent unit for combating corruption, based in 2011
The permanent force for combating corruption, based in 2011 is also involved in the fight with his military government supervisors, investigators and analysts.
To this the police officers' Marteauovy an array of 'who from 2009 to ensure that the Montreal' cartel penězovodů 'significantly reduce the to inflate the procurement...
In recent weeks have made a number of checks and have accused of fraud and corruption a number of local councillors, such as, for example, Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, a mayor one community from the suburbs.
Another on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, which has just resigned from his post mayor of municipalities Laval, the third largest quebeckého cities.
It is suspected that has repeatedly take bribes in return for public procurement.
A formal indictment already received also transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito has caused a sensation that, when the Commission explained mechanism 'system' the acquisition of public procurement.
He spent his during these years 3% of the value of procurement, which in Montréalu prostředníkovi, combined with mafias, which then money převáděl the Union Montréal, for which he ran mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after the year 2000 generous on all the parties and, more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 the euro) to the provincial parties, however, in particular, Liberals, who were then in power.
He also to the fact that organised illegal obtaining finance for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
Contracts with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal 'corruption' system worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, the former transport engineer, it before the Commission very has described in detail: in ten years have received from the construction companies gifts invitation on trips, golf tournament, in restaurants, hockey struggles and kapesné worth a total of the 736 000 dollars in exchange for procurement with penězovody, for which nadsazoval price.
The other public officials from the transport sector admit that we have to pay for that 30% and 40% nadhodnocovali invoices through false víceprací.
Organizer starostovy the Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye from the fact that without embarrassment přivíral eye to the parallel budget, which in his Treasury transport illicit money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay at the beginning of November, thereby Montréal plunged into widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými Members who issued a warning signal.
As a mayor constituency Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, since the year 2010 against selling obecního land zakoupeného for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotérům vzkvétajícího the midst of a trade with the real estate.
70% laundering in electoral campaigns
On the investigation, which will finally be opened, says that 'is pulling its strings in order to understand how the system promořeného saying to stop gangrénu and načapalo culprits'.
The process is under the 'painful, but a positive'.
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is necessary to set up in Montréalu own investigation unit and supervision, to ensure that these dubious practices could not go back.
As when uklízí.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that 'public officials ended up alienating hundreds of millions of dollars', but fear in particular the role of 'Members informed about this stratagems', if these gaming nenamočili!
Estimates that 70% of the campaign financing in Québeku comes from laundering, and with the irony is: 'I just that it is only weak brew of fact,'.
Quebecká the government proposes to limit the gifts parties at $100, but that it will solve the situation: 'For as long as the strictly limited electoral spending, dirty money from the policy will not go away. "
It proposes a comprehensive control system of public procurement and funding of parties: 'which we can no longer fall; if we look boldly at the substance of the things we can build on more solid foundations and with greater control and compliance with the law.'
If this story očernil picture Quebeku and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends all those who are flouting to look at their own courtyard of...
'PSG is not FC Barcelona!'
In this season PSG you with an entirely new momentum.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals go to itself, or completely new dimension PSG.
The big players came to us.
Alongside them every day brings me on.
Technical team me also a lot of help.
Every day these fact, allow me to raise the level of the game.
And in the battles that is simpler.
In football it is all very much quickly.
I have not given up but its head.
Since the beginning of my in přípravce in INF Clairefontaine after přestup into Saint-Etienne, I have always been pushed on the various degrees.
Therefore, you are using the competitive environment, which has introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The additional this summer are accustomed to play games on the very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that player as I have then more taste in the match, and wants to give the maximum.
And, moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal in connection with my position.
To hand is of the assistants, such as Claude Makelele basketball, which at the same position as I do.
And has Ancelotti decisive the floor in the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti is the respect of all the technicians.
Today in 1 League itself does not have equal and are among the best European coaches.
It has enormous experience and sophisticated teams plenty of degrees.
Also worked with excellent players.
I think he wins in Paris other titles.
In January, I had a conversation with him.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
As you are looking to the first part of the season PSG?
In the league of 1, took us Lyon leading position.
But we are lagging behind.
One of our main objectives is the League of masters: very easily we have come into osmifinále.
What is your club in this competition goal?
We will try to go as far away as possible.
Now can become anything.
But we certainly want to be for the quality of the European teams of a rival.
We want to win its first qualification Group before Portem, so that we can play in retaliation osmifinále at home.
Can the PSG state in the short term, a great European club?
This budget is...
To Paris has become a great European club, must win the titles and be listed in history.
Today this is not yet.
On the financial side has PSG means to this intention has managed to take place.
And it would be a failure nezvítězit in 1 League as in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
A lot of this year we want to win ligový title.
In the last season we have enough has been lacking.
In May, we were disappointed, because we have had to win.
We should have an excellent season.
We therefore accumulated 79 points.
Usually, with 79 of the points you have a clear master...
But a different club, Montpellier, should season even more wonderful.
I think that this year it will lead.
Even if the title have large teams, as is the Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have available weapons to be defeated.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual expect from us a lot of given what we have invested and what we have a player.
We are adopting this completely.
Is that, when at home emerge victorious Troyes 4: 0 and still to find something we in the newspapers vyčítají, so this is not pleasant.
One wonders what people want from you can even more.
It is not, of course, to win 4: 0 on every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set the game style.
You need to build a team of time.
In the championship, we have shown that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which is already the second season qualified for the osmifinále, while also invested huge sums!
Given the investovaným sums, we might expect that you will have the other 15 points ahead!
The urážíte other clubs and the French League.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in the last season too failed, with new PSG moved to the next stage.
This shows how it is 1 League wonderful.
I hope that we can smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It seems as if the PSG in all relied on performance Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that says that there is a 'dependence on Zlatanovi'.
This means that Ibrahimovič it is very efficient and that gives a lot of goals.
Due to come here and shows that it is a star 1 League.
Everywhere, where, has shown that it is a big player, the world a star.
We respect the person, and also in our team player.
He also respects the people around them.
What has been achieved, it is truly exceptional.
This led and others to increase their own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, which belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows the other side by side growth.
As you feeling Euro 2012, with the French representatives?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to this tournament ’ s power play.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I was not able to play, as I would imagine.
But I experienced this and I come from a stronger.
Today I have also succeeded in representation play a good struggles.
In this and I had hoped from its boarding representation.
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to themselves, to make our voice exemplary.

Thanks to the Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without banks
All the negative aspects of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, identified transactions and the costs for the processing of the beneficiaries.
How is it in the context of these technologies, moreover, often true, there is feel an obvious political perspective: the belief that the current financial system based on the bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose vynálezcem is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is as virtual money (transferable, however, to dollars, the euro...) and secure the transfer of the protocol a similar BitTorrentu, which allows the exchange of files between dvojicemi partners.
Thanks to the 15 000 computers involved in the network has already been registered around 200 000 transactions.
Around a thousand Web sites is already taking bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoinu first rate has reached peak $30 (23) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, today border on ten dollars (overview of the rate is included on the site bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products this is not an epical.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) on this fact is interested in my report on the virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin calls for 'the most successful virtual money', 'competitive dollar and the euro' and 'the equivalent of ordinary money'.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money that is as' credits' used for the procedure in the video game that one will be a game or that they can buy (and sometimes even back to exchange).
The social networking site Facebook also developed a similar system.
Every month, but the central body controls and carry out an individual of communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all nodes network depozitáři Paper current accounts, supervisors, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
As this network operates?
Each transaction between the two users is in fact, between the two electronic addresses by e-mail.
However, user can address a different for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction tax is electronically signed šifrovacím system with the twin the key.
The network can thus to verify the legitimacy of the transactions.
Thanks to the content of the package is also possible to ensure that vyměněné bitcoiny existed in the public Paper current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in the minutes of this new transactions in the book.
There is help resolve the mathematical task zadaného computers, whose řešitel, a temporary central banker, will have the right dopsat this additional lines.
This is a stage rozřezání file; i.e. to the transformation of the vast body of the shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers' to take the 'this new transaction and add to it, then a whole' will shatter into pieces the several '.
The aim is to find a figure that provides for specific mark (a lot of losers at the beginning of).
Once this figure will find, the other nodes easily checked its accuracy.
Transactions are then nezničitelně zobrazí involved in the chain of all the other transactions; any modification would have to change otisku.
If the user for the purpose of fraud to pay twice the same money very fast (in ten minutes), the network will confirm the only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
A computer that the call to solve, will win 50 bitcoinů.
To avoid inflation, divided into this payment regularly two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited number of 21 million, however, they can share to stomilióntinu, so there is room for a profit margin...
The difficulty of the task of the zadaného also increases with the growing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The Web site, which for Bitcoin provide services were attacked and alienation imposed bitcoinů.
'made loopholes here is not about the Protocol,' assures the Pierre Noizat, which established Paymium, society for the payment of real money, which uses network Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering, thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem is also true for cash.
Wikipedia reject the major players, such as gifts of this nature.
Others, as a platform for blogs WordPress, it is taking.
Adi Shamir and President Dorit Ron of Weizmannova constitution in Israel recently analyse Paper current accounts and demonstrated that, almost 80% bitcoinů neobíhá.
In November were initiated 'massive rebate'.
'It was vyměněno thirty thousand dollars,' enjoying to Jon Holmquist that works for Coinabul dealing with the transformation of the bitcoinů in gold.
Pierre Noizat, which is also the author of the teaching Paper on the money, has a great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia, is equivalent credit-card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu paying mobilem, but using the system Bitcoin for verification transactions, which are cheaper thanks to this.
Moreover, the winner manages its identity and it can remain anonymous.
The system is easily setting for traders, where it is not needed to install new terminals or software.
We need to address, which can be the phone 'ofotografovat and to recognise the', clarifies the Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to horizontálnějším systems.
'Before the Bitcoin, even this will take time, but the year 2013 could be decisive,' predict.
Moreover, the ECB in its report assumes a review of the different risks that are now considered to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.
We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
The French troops leave their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the American troops should be followed by the end of the year 2014.
It is time for the Afghan Army seized control of its territory and to the Afghans choose their own future and waiting for everything from us.
The greatest damage to the Afghan people have suffered from the countryside, which we punish them, because we have considered it a terrorists.
And we also, after all, we lost 88 killed soldiers, and that all those injured and mutilation.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, a former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often the villagers who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They simply want to defend their ancient and archaic tradition, even when they joined the jihadists, Pakistánci, the Arabs, many Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Now experiencing tolerance and frequent help local insurgents, but if the Western forces out their support for the decline.
The departure of the French troops from the foundations of Nijrab, which I followed the mountains of vrcholků posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, there was an orderly.
Convoys of megaliners and pancéřovaných vehicles have arrived in Kabul without involving the air escort helicopters.
Since the end of the year 2014 already in Kabul talibánci not as active.
Since their nezastavitelného procedure in 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was currently empty and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
Their take control of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism these appreciation, which completely dominated by organisations Al-Ká 'Ida when it their situation, however, in our time has not improved.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan Government and the current talibánci agree in order to maintain the women in inferior position.
The main dignitaries from the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They have become of these profiteers, zmocňovali the state of land sold as a construction land refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and using the huge US procurement for subcontractors.
Discredit the majority of them; moreover, or never in the fight is not.
According to what I have heard in campaigns, people aspire to the government, which will form the thieves.
Many young want to go as leave those who make use of the American largesse: capital flight is considerable.
Young already are tired of war and the associated ideology.
During the exile in Iran or in Pakistan to the modern world and its benefits is adopted.
Approximately 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul live in the present 5 million inhabitants, the fifth of the total population.
In the cities are state schools, there is full of girls and boys.
These young people will be given to the work they have already do not want to return to obscurantism earlier parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed opposition, like a mobile phones and Turkey; television series, which show the modern world, are everywhere.
The army is already present.
The authorities will be that stand up to its head, regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army has already restore the provincial militias, which will be outside the control of central power.
Afghanistan, hornatá country with a strong influence local identity should should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation of the Western states, but the US it wanted to turn to a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the abolition of the post of Prime Minister, that existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want to foreign control, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, it is from the 1950 ’ s and previously significantly dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has not managed to restore, no dam is not working, is not corrected no fundamental irrigation system.
Everything is imported; nothing is not produce the only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is to private initiative.
In a country devastated by the three decades of war would be necessary government control of infrastructure.
Rumors flew of that Afghanistan has huge raw materials.
And only fueling the feeling that Western States have been only to be hijacked by it.
Without energy on the processing of iron ore or copper on the ground and the means to the transport of raw materials through mountains but no the extraction of mineral cannot take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned mine in Mes Aynak copper and international archeologickým teams (for the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to examine the felling of Buddhist site to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is responsible for a large proportion of imports and exports, restore the normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops has been completed on 20 November.
The new Treaty on the cooperation presupposes the continuation of normal types of aid: girls and chlapecká lycea, the Department of French universities, the French of Technology, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural area, the promotion of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 work initiative 'to gain the heart and soul' attempting to a daunting task to reconcile the aid and military activities, in which then has acted service 'občansko-armádních steps' the Department of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved thanks to the small French NGO many successes in the area of common interest and actions for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, in which the number of local workers, help to relieve the uprising: irrigation, well, drinking water, forestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of cultivable land.
The memory of consecutive leave after two billion euros military expenditure?
Much more modest budget would contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often in altitudes over 2 000 metres.
Embassies have received dozens of a written request for a small agricultural aid from the local community in the province of Kapisa.
To these farmers liberated from the uprising by foreign groups, they want to achieve a slight civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and about them directly.
The difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohammad Mursí laid into another poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided because of the declaration of the Constitution, which he temporarily grants unrestricted powers, he decided to play a vabank.
In the centre of the announced irrespective of the opinion that all the other, the constituent assembly tomorrow approve the final text.
Less than a week ago, the head of state this Assembly of the other two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years is using Egypt provisional the text, which was very much supplemented, which undermines the constitutional the stability of the country and leads to the legal rumours.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition President, in its' autocratic deliriu ', continue to' violates its word 'and' tramples on the right '.
His supporters, but that it is a means to crack down on as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transitional process.
In two weeks ago, it should be a referendum.
It is a very short time slot, which will compel the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article by article.
For President, it is also about the way to achieve the national and the democratic legitimacy, while the whole country being rocked by the protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly newspaper Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
In particular, therefore, that this hastily organised the vote is the people of Egypt before the ultimatum: 'It approve my text, or leave unlimited powers', which otherwise would have for the adoption of a new constitution end.
And, in this specific air yesterday 85 of the Members of this constitutional assembly with a large majority of the Islamists text approved.
The majority of the Liberals have been lacking in the vote.
In the middle of November, not long before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli doors with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or religious minorities their step napodobili.
The quorum to be reached yesterday morning, has been rushed introduction of 11 people from the ranks of náhradníků.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution have often been voted through unanimously.
Commentators further suspended at the fact that one of the few disputes with the day točil around... hours for the prayer, when some Members of the committee held the view that an hour in this Chamber are rightly seřízeny.
The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, is composed of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains the same with the end of the version of the 1971 constitution and states that 'the principle of Sharia law are the main source of law'.
The Salafi parties, for which is the introduction of Islamic law one of the fundamental requirements, hoped, that will replace the term 'principle of' with 'rules', which would allow more stringent implementation.
For the Islamists, in turn, the fact that this article has not been corrected, is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other component parts of the Egyptian society.
'the hypocrisy of the', argue the Liberals, who see in this just a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamification of the constitution is taking place through other articles.
Focus particularly on Article 220, which confers on university al-Azhar advisory role, especially for the issue of control of the laws of the agreement with Sharia law.
According to the professionals to Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is worrying, because 'people drafted in to the expression of are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see this as beginnings of theocracy '.
The concerns of Liberals even more fuels the fact that the next President, universities should be less moderate than the existing.
Meanwhile, the 'displayed no specific religious result.
With this constitution remains Egypt aware of the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who worked on this text, are not ulamové, but the University, many of them vystudovala in the French schools, 'life-threatening concerns Alexis Blouet, which is preparing to work on constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, agree with the fact that 'there can be controversy over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used the deadlines are in the religious terminology.
There is, in particular, the reference to 'fiqh' [Islamic rule of science, which red.].
And, in future, it may be a question, to what extent are the civilian judges competent to be able to express'.
Yesterday the agreed text is in addition to the religious sites very criticised because of the enhanced powers, which grants the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that have been significant restrictions on the former regime.
Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army will not be the verification of the budget for the defence of the implementation of Parliament, but the National Council of defence.
Furthermore, will not be in the military courts banned management with civilians, requested by associations for the protection of human rights.
These associations, speaks in connection with the text that they think it is directed against freedom, their doubts.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and an insult to continue to be banned, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
No article, moreover, does not deal with the protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.
According to it is the only positive point to ban torture stated in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While Egypt ’ s president should yesterday evening to speak in TV speech, this afternoon are planned manifestation.
Supporters of the Heads of State will then demonstrate on Saturday.

'Big and powerful' that will announce to Moscow: the émigrés we will save money on the language
While the Members and human rights defenders are still debating the law on the mandatory language tests, in the country has already found fraudsters selling 'falsified' certificates
In Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities, every year, 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their sole aim is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December came into force of the law, according to which everyone will be the workers can be obliged to the test of the knowledge of the Russian language.
Yet this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, residential and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that time will be the appropriate tests mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will be composed not only of Language Competence, but also from the Russian history and of the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also be to affirm to gain and the extension of a work permit.
Exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where it is ruština official language.
This law are not subject to or people who have successfully achieved atestace and to obtain academic degree in the USSR ’ s collapse in 1991.
The benefits, condemnation and the protection of rights
The network of the test jobs will be to work under the auspices of Puškinova the Constitution of the Russian language, the University of friendship between nations, the Moscow State University, the State University in St Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can to pass exams in all cities; already today in Russia is open to the more than 160 such centres.
The initiative to support the introduction of the testing of support and Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal migration services).
But before the law entered into force, the defenders of human rights very much to ask the question: in the press and what it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the sake of visitors?
Above all - are the responsibility of the representatives of the migration services - to enable it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of 'slave labour'.
Many people now talks about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the President of the boards of directors FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.
Only the system will enable the organised the recruitment of 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in emigrants without the occupation, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical check-up.
Without the knowledge of the language - says with conviction Sebelev - is the future can be sentenced to conflicts with dishonest people who help him under the pretext of 'ensure' reference to the terrible, small kind, in which he and dozens of others, such as he himself, suffer months without food and documents and fingers for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.
'In their own country they promise one, but it is, after arrival podvedou zabaví them passports, not paid the promised wages, the Tajik governance' confirms the migration of labour MS Tolib Šaripov.
Nenadávejte!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia, recognise that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to go, but they have no experience even with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, as the disaster: very little Turkmen, Uzbeks Tajiks can afford to regain at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families need something also feed children, not to mention the fact that we need is decently obléci, road and equip to school.
As children mature in the working age, they must go there in the first opportunity for work.
Without the knowledge of the language that is difficult - to admit it.
'you feel the humiliation and less worthy'.
It is true that, with regard to the law on the language tests point human rights defenders in one important thing.
Testing will be implemented only for those migrants who have the legal status.
If it will not have, so will not have to pass exams or will not get any additional official work.
Meanwhile, there are the majority of migrant workers, as well as ever in Russia illegally.
'Welcome to, or Nepovolaným'
Many of the coming of workers argue that to get the official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all those of the linguistic difficulties.
Legalising in addition, the costs money: from 12 to 16 000 rubles.
But the false registration can be obtained rapidly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have essentially false documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
'require a, two on cigarettes, tea,' - share with journalists on their experience citizen Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
'Well, Don ’ t be stingy, kup the malbu'
In the first day of the force of the law on the language of the false papers are not only on the registration of migrants.
Employees FMS has already been seized a number of false certificates confirming completion of the language tests.
Falsified documents are printed on ordinary color tiskárně.
Of course, to new owners were free of charge: each of the migrants in the hope that this will facilitate the problem with absolvováním tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
That is two and half times higher than carry out an official test: it will become a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future so is to ensure the system from corruption, so that workers could not simply buy documents, in that coincide with government officials and defenders of human rights.
The government authorities have not yet can promise to foreign workers, who failed tests first time, the time required to have completed a rate of the foundations of the Russian language.
In the visitors, who cannot Russian-speaking, it is supposed to work in the areas in which does not require active negotiations with the people.
The MVD (the Ministry of Interior) does not take into circulation illegal arms market
The share of the crimes of using legally converted weapons is very low
The MVD Russia putting forward a proposal for a tightening of law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of government institutions on the recent events: the incentive cases were shootings at svatbách that bypass without of the victims, and the massacre prepared Moscow advocate Dimitrij Vinogradovem, as a result of which seven people died.
The police wants to ban the wearing of the dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age, which can be to obtain a licence to the wearing of weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This support the idea of a committee of the Duma for security and the fight against corruption Irina Jarovaja, which has promised to amend the law on weapons will be presented to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to cope with the problem of 'tightening the screws'.
In a network of an open letter, which the authors - the representatives of the different social střeleckých organisations - demanding the rejection of the 'of the tightening of the' law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is a minimum, said, a lawyer Vasily Lesnikov and kriminalista in an interview with the Russian editorial offices of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior was for six months of the year 2012 committed 142 crimes of the use of firearms registered authorities in the Ministry of Interior, while for the same period was committed quite 1168 of thousands of criminal offences.
The authors of an open letter believe tighten up legislation in the area of civilian weapons fail to get the perpetrators to come to the 'black' market.
According to their words can be at the moment to find in Moscow any weapon at low cost.
Currently the Ministry of Interior say that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from plants after officers
'black' arms market stockpiles few channels.
The main channels is five, says the Colonel retired Victor Baraněc, who has worked ten years in the workplace of the Ministry of Education and of staff.
Screenshot sites, which are the order of weapons
The first of them - 'the army or military way', this means a weapon, which was odcizena during the fighting in the Caucasus.
'Weapons stole and Russian officers and the kavkazané,' says Baraněc.
Another type of 'black arms' weapons are stolen criminals with the representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes the theft of the police and weapons inventories stolen directly from the staff of the authorities in criminal proceedings.
Illegal 'mainly' in the sale of the military inventories.
In many military warehouses there is often a professor.
'It is a proven fact that some of the fires were based deliberately - in order to cover the Manka,' says the former soldier.
Its contribution to bring in the words Barance and the arms manufacturers.
'At present there are private firearms enterprises, which are not competitive on the international market, and they decommission weapons, which are on the black market, including the Moscow,' says the expert.
Another source of the 'black' of the market is smuggling.
Particularly large number of a gun, and machines from poor countries, such as, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
'Wherever men and women is their production, sometimes weapons produced in malovýrobě, and the mafia, which was organised their steady production,' explains the former soldier.
Where is the weapon?
Experts sečetli, what is an the share of the various sources of supply of illegal weapons on the 'black' market.
The report on this issue has wrought on in 2011, the analysis of the problems and design of the public administration.
Specialists examine reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Russia ’ s statistical office, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at the theme of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all weapons is on the black market 'fault of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons,' says the report.
According to data, which have researchers available, comes from 17% of arms from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases to the theft of weapons in their production, 5% is' black archaeology '.
Prodavač-konzultant one of the trade in arms, who asked to confuse his name is convinced that weapons found in vykopávkách black 'archeology' no one is a long time ago - are simply too old.
The most frequently, as it says, retailers drive for the new consignments directly to the military inventories.
Despite praporčíka the people who want to buy a unit, for example, the gun TT.
For him to weapon you ordered it to you and he sold via the fence.
'He walk away with it in the cities and where it sells for 900 euro to deal with two recharges,' tells.
'The truth is that the police is well in the picture, and that is why, whenever they will begin hořet plan in the detection rate for crimes they control the purchase for traders with illegal weapons,' gives advisor.
'As in a luxury trade'
Selling with each other through their buyers who are most commonly known.
Navštěvoval I Web sites and blogs, as long as has emerged chap who donates a me the opportunity to offer a platform 'test', where will the man, I would have brought into the 'nook', where, together we will act.
The price of mainly I have learned to
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
Expect to obtain a weapon, I have known, who knows a way out, tells the salesperson - poradce.- such a well-known I am fully him, but I do not trust.
Retailers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, theoretically 'from Mr Ivan Ivanoviče, who asked me to pass on that dcerce get a tooth'.
And now it is where I come across a man who, I am certain.
He also give only me, because he knows that it neudám.
Začátečníci are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990 ’ s, when drew up to publish a paper on this subject.
Schemes, according to his words not changed.
To give him the album with photographs, where it was' everything that you would think '.
'I feel as though I am in a luxury trade,' recalls soldier.
The buyer, in the words Baraněce, do not offer the pig in a poke - everything you can to try.
I, the potential the client simply nekupuji - we are going with the buyer into the forest and that we erect target.
'give me the opportunity to fire, and when convincing that weapon shooting well, we are beginning to act,' describes the procedure expert.
Zásobník to couch geostrategists
On the Internet search engine you will put on the website of the 'Vkontaktu', where the offer to buy arms' for various purposes'.
For this is not the need for any documents or personal meeting.
'Stačí have set out the amount of money' write in advertising heading on websites' to buy the combat gun or automat '.
On behalf of the users of these sites their statements and ask questions.
And the sale of minors?
'Of course, that without licences,' questioning the user of the 'Ivan' (spelling is preserved).
'buy TT.Moskva' - briefly formulates the call for 'Fedorenkov'.
The Federal Security Service recently rozhodila a huge network of the dummy Web sites and those who wish to buy military weapon can shrabovat lopatou.
People are pouring as the hungry fish the bait and then storming coal in Siberia.
Military the rapporteur and higher military hodnostář Viktor Baraněc
I have heard on such schématech: registered websites are usually beyond the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
Buyers will carry out the payment of despite the ATM.
'In response to send him selling photographs and description of with the guidelines where is the weapon hidden,' tells spokesperson of the non-governmental organisation 'right to weapon' Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that, after the orders on websites you can remain without weapons and finding itself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently rozhodila a huge network of the dummy Web sites and those who wish to buy military weapon can shrabovat lopatou.
The 'People have been pouring as the hungry fish the bait and then storming coal in Siberia,' confirms.
For $100 Makarov
When buying illegal firearms you pay according to estimates of experts amount usually from 100 to $900.
According to the words of Dmitri Kislova of non-governmental organisations' right to weapon 'you will seek gun Makarov for 100 to $300.
You have to wait until one month and a half months.
Weapon is expeduje from stores to the long-term storage through stores middle of Article.
According to official statistical office has fallen compared with a period of January - October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia a total of 7%, and return was 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of objasněných cases of theft and blackmail weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices has fallen by 7.8%.
In the US on strike workers fastfoodů and supermarkets
Work on purse establishments' McDonald 'through and a quarter of all US teenagers
In recent days in America has a wave of protests against low wages in hypermarketech society and Walmart in restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as' McDonald ',' Burger King ',' Taco Bell ',' Wendy 'with' and 'Kentucky Fried Chicken'.
Yet no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is doomed soon cease to exist.
This whole share for the support of the trade unions and the many left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest as salaries, which are ordinary workers in Walmartu and in the systems of fast food, is the aim of the protests to achieve in the creation of them in their trade unions.
Currently it is this economic sector virtually intact odborářským movement.
46 cents per year?
Action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called 'black Friday', when America has hit orgy of cheap fire sales, by the millions of people and in some cases has been accompanied by a rvačkami.
In this day some workers society Walmart, in which around the world is working to 2.2 million people have left their workplace and demonstrated together with the trade unions and the left-wing activists multinationals chains, whose goods is addressed to the people of lower and middle classes.
Walmart sold throughout the world, despite everything, from plenek hunting guns and car batteries after vysavače, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are in the average of about 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in stores Walmart buys only for themselves in work.
The availability and the range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of the critics Walmart can afford to sell goods as cheaply partly because few pay their employees.
They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic wheelchairs or small scanners.
The demonstrators' black Friday 'called for an increase in salaries and they complained about this, provided that the costs of health insurance companies have risen sharply from 30 billion to $100 per month.
A typical worker Walmart receives 9.5 of dollars per hour, however, this does not correspond to the level of expenditure, they say employees.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley shows that, if Walmart increase the average wage of at $12 for an hour, it will be a society state 3.2 billion dollars per year.
It is in an average of 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If a company Walmart will increase in wages fully on the shoulders of the consumers, each state visit in store only 46 cents more.
For the year so that consumers will spend around $12,39 more than today.
Defenders of society Walmart point out that protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause practically no damage.
'black Friday' in the shops society has lasted from 8 p.m. this evening on Thursday, until midnight the next day, and during this period, the company sold Walmart some 5,000 items of goods for the second.
Overall, its coffers have made in 'black Friday' almost 100 million transactions.
Representatives of society Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of 'less than five' staff Walmartu, and that protest was full of 'all other media sensation', which organised the trade unions.
'vacant Treasury!'
Protests continue this week in New York, where their aim was not the trading houses Walmart (those pokrokovém in the city are not too much in favour of, and there is therefore hardly), but 'McDonald' and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that sells billion portions, and then you nor does not properly with sick and you for your serious work!
Jumaane Williams, a Member of the City Council in New York
Currently make the minimum wage for the work in line with federal laws and with the rules of the State of New York 7,25 of dollars per hour.
Fastfoodové restaurants this wage gradually increasing, but only slightly, and on average, their ordinary workers in New York 8,90 of dollars per hour.
In this drahém city no one has a lower wage.
Well, I cannot understand how can you in New York exist for this money.
Employment in the 'McDonald' it is almost a quarter of US teenagers who work for the end of the school part-time work and live with their parents.
Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or intends to remain there for a long time.
At present is constantly meet in an interview with the workers' McDonald 'who complain that must live from this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in the forum of the Wall Street Journal a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how it is you feed.
The protesters, which began in the morning on Thursday 6: 30 on the 'McDonalda' on the 40th Street and on America Avenue, demand that the bank clerks and kuchaři in business dinners started to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wages.
Also called for in the sphere of fast food trade union organisations were founded.
American laws forbid governance to defend the establishment of a trade union activists and to punish the trade union movement bullying and layoffs.
From the other side of the governance of the only rarely makes life easier for them.
To introduce in business dinners trade unions, however, it is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is extremely high staff turnover.
Disagreement
In this day were held loud protests in many other cheap restaurants Manhattan.
The culmination of this action was at midday Assembly in the 'McDonalda' near the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially Member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald' says that sells billion portions, and then you nor does not properly with sick and you for your serious work! '
The demonstrators have a support also other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the candidate for the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that 'we need to act together to support workers fastfoodů to achieve fair pay for their work and economic prosperity, deserves every a New Yorker!'
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of America ’ s sphere of fast food.
But it was attended by just a few hundred people, even if not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will spark that will spark a mass movement extinguished, is still unclear.
'We are the brain to deceive, on average,'
Between the supporters of modern technologies, the virtual reality is popular the subject of the enlarged reality; in the last time, this means regarding the world in particular through hranol special glasses.
In the early years of its annual conference has Google working model of this new, and in November, it was announced that the request for the patent has also submitted a Microsoft.
From an interview with the head of the interactive 3D technologies in Cambridge laboratory society Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that this company to the scientists are glasses already past.
Is it is the perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air empty-handed, the creation of a virtual public spaces.
- Tell us please, aware of the framework of the deals with your research group?
- We are dealing with a person's interactions with machines, but at the same time, we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has locked in the stage of work with pixely ploché on the screen, the most, sometimes touches on the screens the finger.
We want vyhlížet in 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, konzola Xbox and sensors Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without sensors Kinect, because for all is very interesting the possibility of management by gestures.
- What is still ahead of us in the future?
- Notwithstanding the fact that the system Kinect relocate interaction on physical level, very many interactions is still ongoing on ploché the screen, sometimes in 3D.
Entry to improve the flow of information (system takes on a greater amount of data), but so far, the exit the flow of not particularly.
We are trying to change this, we are working on the really trojrozměrných display systems based on the various technologies, including projektivních.
It is necessary to allow computer the world into our physical world, to do it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to get to know not only users, but also the room around him.
We will then be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first and foremost - to hell with those brainless helmami virtual reality!
- What do you think about hlasovém control?
This is a popular thing, but the nepřeceňuje?
- Certainly it cannot be regarded as a panacea - the question arises as to privacy, because not always want to inform the rest in our neighbourhood on their actions and intentions.
In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the control of the equipment in public places, we had the project in which we think about the gestures, but not on rozmáchlých, only about such skoupých, short.
Gestures are doing nesnímala kamerou equipment, but náramkem, which would monitor movements of bones and muscles.
Meanwhile, it is great, but, in theory, it can be narrowed on the size of the náramkových watches.
In general, however, that the future is a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- A both?
For example - As you ask me give you this can limonády?
You say it and, at the same time, get.
- I usually simply I am speaking.
- Oh, that will be very difficult to identify.
- So, you want to make users to adapt to what at the moment can or cannot machine?
- That is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work, above all, on the development of new types of sensors that can find out more precisely the response of the person.
It may be, for example, laserové sensors, which provide a relatively good an in-depth distinction, this is very important.
- if you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requests for modern cameras?
Today, the depth of the distinction is not sufficient or something else?
- In essence the current generation - that this is, from what we can be reflected in our work on a three-dimensional detection.
Of course, that it would be good to obtain 8 megapixelů the rate of 1 000 F / P.
But it is not only megapixely itself, but as matrices and depth.
While looking at issue are all the current technology for the lack of us - this přidělává work designérům algorithms.
So we must bear in mind not only the distinction in axes X and Y, but also.
So very important it is also the speed, the number of images for the second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows 30 images for the second, frankly, are a little, especially for the gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratories in Redmondu did dotykový snímač with nastavitelným delay the processing of 1 100 MS, with the current, sériově produced sensors that are closer to the second value (60-100 MS).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a man with a machine.
For me, in the work was very useful the equivalent of such equipment, only I do not need so much dotyků, but I need some images per second.
- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In a system of Kinect are now used the three 'cameras', one of which is actually infračerveným vysílačem and the other - přijímačem odraženého signal.
Already the third and camera - in fact, this is the normal snímač visible the Gaza.
It does not apply to the setting of the depth of objects.
Greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem of...
Or worse, because it would be required to increase the volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible system, analogový Kinect pohrát have to be concerned about the curvature of the location of the cameras and look at how this will help in determining a three-dimensional location.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) has not presented publicly my glasses.
Do you not think that when it comes to the day-to-day reality of the widespread use of technologies with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, go and constantly keep smatphone in zdvižených the hands of is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be 'transferable' form of the enlargement of the reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the platform clouds přepínat ever from the blinkers on phones, projekční displej and further round in circles.
Glasses - this is a very personal equipment, that is their power (private things you can see only you), and, at the same time, the weakness - widespread the reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on the same time, the virtual objektech with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holografickými injuries in the air is available not only Tony Starkovi in the 'Iron Isle of Man', but also the normal smrtelníkovi.
There is one of the problem to which the critics often point: there is no dotyková response!
Do not feel hand nothing!
What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
- In its přednáškách I often say that the enlarged reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think that the hmatových vjemů could well become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, it is being one of the interesting tricks - the use of the other hand, as a kind of Toulouse on display.
An excellent way, drive down!
But there are also technologies that are genuinely targeted at adding hmatatelnosti these 'lines in the air' - for example, interference few rays směrových ultrazvukových in defined the point where is the finger, raises hmatový sense, but it is still very weak - as if you foukal on bříška fingerprints.
There is also náramek on the wrists, which affects the nerve endings detect in prstech - also promising direction.
- We have tried to deceive the brain?
To think that they feel what it seems that, should feel, at the moment when something see?
- That is a good idea, we have not yet nezkoušeli.
There is yet another challenge which will be to fight for a long time - how to make the person who is physically is in a very stísněném area, to believe that is open, practically an endless space - we are also working on the concept of běžeckých lines (no such as in clubs), moving platform and also of huge land.
If the deception of the brain is becoming the aim, so it is still work for many years.
This is what does work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things in the very beginning.
Instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru Vkusovština
'Rosbalt' is the continuation of the project 'Petrohradská avantgarda', dedicated to the citizens, who are at the forefront, are avantgardou art and culture.
At the top of the list has been notable výtvarné scenes of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, are often recognition in Europe without achieve všeruského high regard.
The new the hero of 'Rosbaltu' it is amazing artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyrila Millera - vousatého men, which is the whole oblečen in the red, which potkáváte here with the Russian museums, here in the summer gardens, here in cutting-edge hospůdkách and vernisážích.
The images Cyrila Millera, wherever they are subjected to, always attract crowds viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrohradských vypravěčů, the creators of new mytologií.
Cyril Miller - it is striking a man of St. Petersburg avantgardy the end of the 1980 ’ s and early 1990s.
In addition, that is the urban man, his zjev on the streets of a smile on the face of the citizens, is increasing all the mood.
Recently taken into the hands of flašinet and became Petersburg residence flašinetářem, because in this difficult role come his whole bohémským life, the philosophy and image.
- Cyrile why chodíš after the town of the whole in the red and not in the West or, for example, in tyrkysovém?
- I choose to the red colour as the designer dealing with and image.
In this world is a red colour of the compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, aggression and reinvigorates bad characteristics.
But my provocations are aimed at this, it was tied to an interview.
The whole history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to the debate.
- A when you understand that you be artist?
- On the Sakaharov in the House of culture on Něvském, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
Then proceeded wave of the old free unofficial of artists and new types of artists, free, I failed to understand.
I have made friends with artists, with a new wave of post-gazoněvskými, who led us to 'Puškinské 10', and another wave of were not.
Attracts me to the play, dress, music, in all genres in addition to the words.
- A all this into what became known as in your art-klinice... - For me, it was important to find themselves in the centre of culture Petersburg, where should muster all the best forces of creativity.
In 1995, I place on the occupying Puškinské 10, and there was even before the reconstruction hudebně-umělecký club bohémský club, the home petěrburkské bohémy.
There was born out many: NOM, Tequila jazz, do not forget, as Šnura brought with the project 'ear van Gogh'.
Šnur and his friends to sing songs, oblékali under překližkou easy to přiléhavých trikotů, in the middle between them composer Igor Vdovin, which is now in vogue.
When had begun to play on the ground, it has become a 'Leningradem'.
Trachtenberg led many programmes hali-galivských times.
We give them Trachtěnberga, the start of his great careers, the basic education and training has gained from us.
Galleries' D 137 ', the club' Gribojedov - that is dozvuk Art Clinic.
That have left our workers and the permanent guests.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture even mean something.
In 2000 was a survey was in the press, special price was' Those in our city '.
In the nomination of 'the artist of' I was appointed as I, thus ended my the top.
In the new times under the old rules is the work of the inconvenient truth, I am a man, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity today are different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Tvá works are characterised by rozpoznatelným way.
- Many of my images are hity in which is vividly depicted the timeliness and pronikavost.
I will be the top of the exhibition 'of the Russian museum in klaunech'.
Clowns are nadčasovou categories.
Before I have a social, today, be a painful and terrible.
But in klaunech everything close snímá the tragika.
I love grotesku, I get grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world the way in the guise of the totalitarian nařizovacím Procedure.
Today, people face in the clothes of their ability to external mechaniku, not on the internal person.
Or perhaps it cannot be to hand and to be plivnout in the face.
And mirrors převlékáním will be removed.
- Recently we have you seen in the role of urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would it should be, if not I?
- A can be commercial art beautiful?
- At present should be the commercial, utilitarian the art of thorough, respectful, fresh.
There is the collapse of the cultures.
Before people arrived in hloučcích, bohéma loved one simple other people.
Today, everything to mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I am not stodolarová banknote, to have liked to all.
Today we need to think, who are zalíbíte.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 supporters.
- A Stasu Michajlova comes to several thousand spectators!
- On fanynky it will come, there is engaged sexually the social sphere.
And on the cultural land will come of 300 people and 10 000 of them will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything languishes.
I have supporters, the main thing is that nobody is neoklame and with abandon, what is the usual.
When I was young, be painting such images that I for one sběratele visely on the wall together with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images of people, which often end up.
Today, people often confuse the concepts.
They say: the culture of the spiritual, the culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of the consumer, it is elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who live in poverty and died in poverty, the money for kreslení images.
And I am for a culture.
- Cyrile Petersburg in what is the lack of?
- good experts on culture.
There is such a concept: činovník through culture.
Not every one of them, but can deal with culture.
For the proper of this was not the case in all, the Tsars perhaps too understand culture, but they understand that it is necessary to promote real expertise.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
For us in St Petersburg we have the people who could be experts, but they are zastrčení somewhere in there, because they are to be large experts, who rightly acknowledges these experts and state is on track.
Today, is thriving vkusovština.
The same Erarta, differ by honestly say that not everything modern art we are adopting, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is under you Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk - this is not the Capital of Culture, in Moscow is culture much more, there is the land.
And on our waste is the art of managing abjectly.
We need a cultural soil, but for us today is writers more than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe is very many people who are curious, who would like to go to the exhibition concerts.
For us is such a class only weak.
We need to art has become fashionable matter, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for the funds grant St.Petěrburku
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or the collision with zabijáckým asteroidem.
Caravans space korábů with pozemšťany on board are embarking on the way, are looking for spare planet.
To save the humanity, the main question arises: how to maintain their family in conditions beztíže or on the spare planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two of the planet, which is possible to adopt, even if only theoretically.
'It is Venus and Mars,' says the senior scientific worker State astronomic in Technology P. The. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While they are but on Mars better conditions for life, on the surface temperature Venus are 500 degrees Celsius.
To live there is only possible in large altitudes or orbitě Venus... in space.
To address the issues of reproduction in the universe started scientists with flora.
For half a century ago were carried out experiments on plants.
Four generation pea plants grown in orbit are no different from their land relatives.
Then it was carried out on a insects orbitu - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979 was sent into space křepelčí eggs, to determine how it is developing an embryo in a state of beztíže.
We absolutely normal ptáka in output.
But then the problems begin.
'there is a problem with the fact that this bird must find a basis, must stand on its own two feet and start to move,' says the laboratories Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) of the wounds Vladimir Syčev.
If there is no basis, birds chaotically fall and somersault with each other.
After 10 hours by the newly vylíhnutých birds to the total demise instincts.
Birds have not responded to the light of even noise.
And the problem was that, in four days simply died.
'Dvakrát we left vylíhnout birds, but then we have refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them,' comments on the failure of the experiment with the chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last 'miniarcha' of animals go into orbit, 16 years ago.
In the spring 2013 will experiments to continue.
In biosatelitu 'Bion' but only being one of the sexes.
There was an experiment with potkany, who were already gravidní broadcasting into space.
In fact, there have nothing nadpřirozeného.
'It was only on biosatelitech, but once again - it is a unique experiment, and such attempts must be carried out,' says Vladimir Syčev.
After the landing on the country with a space potkanům their offspring.
To move closer to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, so far failed.
It is a difficult task.
Animals in the loss of the usual environment simply cannot to implement their sexual instinct.
One, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens there is an abstract thinking and is able to create the appropriate emotional the background.
From the ethical reasons, such experiments implemented.
But women are flying into space for 50 years.

Our Chaika flew and no one on earth could not to say whether the last years in space.
After such a flight whether it will be able to give birth to the child.
'Look on this question still no one has not replied, "says the veteran raketově-vesmírného sector Vachtang Vačnadze.
In June in 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, have had the first žena-kosmonautka Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The child's father was also kosmonaut Andrijan Nikolajev.
In 1988 was born the son of the other ženě-kosmonautce Světlaně Savické which visited orbitu twice and which also worked in an open space.
The risk remains, however.
We have only a few cosmonauts, which, after years of the health of children born and grow.
'. This can be dangerous and in orbitálních years,' says kosmonaut-pilot, Hrdina of the Soviet Union and Russia's Hrdina Valerij Poljakov.
Mankind yet must inevitably seek out new paths in biotechnology, radiological protection and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is compulsory stage of the preparations for the flight.
Here in the conditions, with no appeal to embrace kosmonauti habits needed to work in an open space.
Water have imitations of the state of beztíže.
Although for adults water is even a convenient, but in a strange environment, for small children is a natural živlem.
Small ichtiandři it seems to confirm that life in the country comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in the average 9 months inside the mother ’ s the amniotic water and that it is then become easier for them to water.
In principle, it is logical, because since the birth, since the first vykoupání, is the only 2 weeks ago.
'That is very little to child something has been forgotten,' says instruktorka swimming of newborns Marina Aksenovová.
In short, if it is for the new-born a baby state of beztíže are concerned, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive power.
In a state of beztíže is very quickly to the falling out břišních muscles, muscles basin is declining, the body ’ s ability to dislodge fruit.
This we can leave aside, if they will work stimulátory the activities of muscles in childbirth.
After all, it is possible to birth should take place in a special Chamber, in which the organism mothers would oust fruit.
'A what further?' puts Valerij Poljakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, a baby also needs an artificial gravity.
If not to the organism to the appeal of the State level, can rightly to form the backbone of muscles or system.
Newborn in orbit is not possible obléci as an adult to a special wanders the burden, in which could train.
Simply will be deprived of what to its development of desperately needs.
'If you go to the experiment, which allows the birth of the child in a foreign environment, přivezeme on Earth person with a disability, which will be absolutely nepřizpůsobená zdejšímu environment,' predict the Commission for Bioethics IBMP wounds Igor Pestov.
So, having children in the universe is now just a theoretical question.
One, however, the time is to become a reality, and when they pozemšťané in their korábech for a long the planet, which will be home to their offspring born in the universe.
The head of NKÚ: control švarcsystému failed due to the politicians
The Czech Republic has in relation to public procurement good supervisors and high quality legislation is lagging behind, but in its application.
In an interview Aktuálně.cz that is what the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
'The will never be perfect, but must be correct its applications - that is what we believe is missing,' comments on the current situation Kala.
Similar conclusions also indicates the joint control of the Czech and German supervisors.
As an example of the practice of States, the wrong approach, Mr Peter Nečase to the so-called 'švarcsystému'.
Recently, Mr Prime Minister has said that the ODS not entrepreneurs bother its checks - it is therefore prohibited or permitted?
'The must be arranged, after all, somehow, and if something ban, so, after all, neither Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to go to control and enforcement obligations,' notes Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and the German side, in which was to the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was specifically?
It is a parallel control, which we launched the about two years ago.
Put simply, it is that the European legislation regulates how to address, followed by the public procurement is the individual national legislation, and then also the practice.
We are all this put together, and although control is not yet closed, have shown us be very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps even 'more stringent and better', however, the practice is in some of the parameters of the better in Germany.
Therefore, confirms that it is not enough to create still further and further more precise rules, but it is a need to devote itself the application of the law.
What you actually this project can help, as it is for you?
That is the joint control could contribute to stop make an effort to specifying the laws, reducing and improvement of limits, if not so positive impact.
Efficiency means to obtain adequate thing for a sensible (but that does not always mean the lowest) price, to avoid enrichment and or criminal behaviour.
But, by reducing the limit of procurement, that we should not necessarily to achieve.
Perhaps that the system overwhelm such a number of 'paper', that those who want to look for the holes in this system, so those of this will be able to a much easier than limit remained higher.
You talk about the domestic problems with the communitarisation of legislation concerning public procurement into practice.
How does the system of control in Germany?
There is the office of a similar our NKÚ, or is it set otherwise?
What the authorities concerned, as there is NKÚ Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised, as we also has the College, only to form a little different way, but in principle, both the authorities are similarly.
Also the powers are to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the auditors and at the level of federal countries - the system from our a little different.
BRH can control only the Federal money for us, represented by the state funding.
Means of public, which are managed in the region and the municipalities, the control of the level of federal courts of auditors.
As the legislation, so it is easier than our?
In general should like this without specific data when not, however, in some respects, Germany is often described as a model, but it is certainly to say that it is in all the better.
It is necessary, therefore, that are better supervisors?
This certainly not, but once again, I do not have such a comparison I.
But it is necessary to say that even countries that we consider it a model, are faced with a series of problems.
Otherwise it would not be a beneficial for them to cooperate with our office, not?
With regard to domestic legislation, as for your office mean the amendment to the law on public procurement, are already somehow its effects?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is a relatively short, so we have not yet in the control actions does not show.
Because we are ex post controls, it is necessary to reckon with some delay.
We are seeing this not only in the process of preparing the future of checks - nastartovali we have our new instrument 'risk detection inefficiencies', through which we prohnali almost 14 of thousands of public procurement, and we have analysed is - there are those changes, of course, will show, because it will change the limits, the conditions of certain types of the selection procedure to govern and so on.
Approval of this law therefore consider rather for the benefit, or additional burden of red tape?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it is the case.
The problem that can arise that the rules' tighten 'and it will not be possible to honour them.
In the functioning of the previous rules are controlled donor (such as those committed in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council) of the fact that every failing to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.
So, is the price of law in this way, become stricter?
I think that, not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want it to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal errors, which has no impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will be to create a more pressure on the red tape.
And how this is therefore out?
Let us show the way the way.
Recently, Mr Prime Minister has said that the ODS not entrepreneurs bother controls on the so-called 'švarcsystému' - and what does this mean?
Švarcsystém is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be arranged, after all, somehow, and if something ban, so, after all, neither Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to go to control and enforcement obligations.
Can say: 'we change the law and permit', but it cannot say that we will do, as that nothing.
In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is rightly, both to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when bidders with the best offer is excluded just for the formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but must be correct its applications - that is what we believe is missing.
Roads are at times, but, mostly namrzlé passable
In several places the Czech Republic are roads namrzlé and also zasněžené.
The majority are but a roadway passable, somewhere with the increased caution.
Karlovarský Székely
In the region were Karlovarském this morning, at times, but namrzlé passable roads, and also zasněžené.
The temperature has fallen between five to 10 degrees below zero, during the day, but it has a slightly warming.
Snowfall in the region have stopped and in nížinách lies only weak class.
On the hřebenech severe the mountains, however, is around 30 centimeters snow.
At times was even lower visibility due to the fog, stems from the data dispečinku county silničářů.
The speed roads R6 and communication first class are in the region now passable without restrictions.
Caution is, however, on the ground, for example, to some přemostěních, where it can be the surface namrzlý and kluzký.
Passable are also all the way the second and third class including mountain roads.
To them but in some sections of the still, there remain zmrzlého and places ujetého snow.
Above all, in higher polohách we need to pay a special attention.
Pardubický and Královéhradecký Székely
On certain roads in the eastern the Czech Republic threatens námraza, in higher polohách and in the mountains, may be on the communications wonky class snow, reports on their website the Director of the roads and motorways.
Road builders warn námrazou drivers before it can, in particular in the form of higher polohách Pardubického regions.
Náledí can be around Lanškrouna, estuary over Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or the United Nations High tolls, and especially on the roads of others and third classes.
Chemicals are treated with the roads I / 43 and I / 34 for Svitav.
Snow is particularly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlických the mountains.
Wonky snow class is in the highest polohách on the roads in the districts Rychnov over Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern the Czech Republic is now clear to most often polojasno without rainfall.
Temperatures are usually between three and a minus plus one degree Celsius, wind is blowing weak.
Plzeňský Székely
Roads in the region are Plzeňském passable this morning, but with caution and driving is to be adapted to the weather.
This is, after the blow cold temperatures are between the three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfalls and the subsequent cooling can be some of the communication namrzlé.
Drivers, must also count on the lifted, visibility, but will gradually improve.
That is clear from the information dispečinku county silničářů.
A motorway D5 sjízdná is almost without restrictions, increased caution, however, recommend the managers of communication between 80 and 131 kilometre.
The majority of the roads is the surface of dry and vymrzlý.
On the southern Plzeňsku and Tachovsku but can be namrzlé the bottlenecks.
Communication of the second and third classes are wet and also in this case namrzlé warning on the roads.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frekventovaných travel in the area of Šumavy.
Olomoucký Székely
With a snow kaší on the road must now count on drivers, pointing to the highest ground Olomouckého regions.
After the chemical posypu remained at the saddle Červenohorském and on the way in the direction to Videlský Cross.
Silničáře forced into the ground in the night snowfalls, on Šumpersku according to the managers of journeys nasněžily roughly three.
In other parts of the regions are a roadway majority passable without restrictions.
'The Šumpersku lies in the top polohách remnants of snow.
With a snow kaší to saddle Červenohorském must count on drivers in the direction to Jeseník, 'said today ČTK dispečer šumperské governance roads.
In the ground in the night vyráželi and their colleagues on AE Jesenicku, the way to the highest location are now, according to them for the chemical treatment bare and wet.
On the Olomoucku passable roads without restrictions, Šternbersku, however, should be careful drivers in forest sections, where a roadway remained wet.
Ústecký land, the Székely Liberecký
Several difficult to sjízdných jobs are today, after a blow to road builders in the north of the Czech.
Aside from a number of jobs with napadaným snow or ledovkou is closed and mountain road from Telnice on Knínice on Ústecku, stems from the police database.
The temperature is also in the lower polohách below zero, so that the ice and snow probably on the roads vydrží.V nížinách, especially from Českého jihovýchodně Protected Area, on the contrary, any problems are not and roads are usually dry.
The operational complications and reported so far are not.
The incidence of ledovky subscribes road builders, in particular, from around Štětí.
According to meteorologů for it in the night of the ideal conditions - despite the day of the rain and melting snowfalls, in the night of clarity and the cold.
Of the main moves are reported the adverse conditions and on the road I / 13 on the border between Ústeckého and Libereckého regions.
Uzavírku of Telnice on Knínice the zohýbané branches of the trees that, under the nánosem snow ohnuly to vozovce.
Shimon Ornest: at concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think that is to be less than a month the end of the world?
This is just one of the other scaremongering, which we people like to chytáme.
Together with kapelou The TAP TAP from that we are doing rather fun and we are saying that we have only had in the world, which will be able to accumulate enough positive energy to the end of the world oddálili or hinder.
Moreover, in December will hold a completely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
It can be the readers closer to imagine?
It is a national benefiční action, which we are planning for two years.
We have chosen to use the potential of the end of a marketing mayského calendar of the announced on 21 December at 11: 10 of the morning.
The day before 20 December, from 9 p.m., in parallel to take place in Prague, 3 concerts Brně and Ostrava.
To finish will be roughly in a time when, on the island Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the Gaza on 12 hours before us, will end up mayský calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
It was about my idea, we then everything devising, together with our výtvarníkem Honzou Augustou.
In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want, together with the public to think about the state of the world will be passed on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the mayského calendar we have also created the unique kolekci objects shoes, T-shirt, bags or original sprouts against the end of the world whose zakoupením on www.e-tap.cz us people can also support.
The Group of the The TAP TAP, together with other the singers also nazpívala the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called 'The End of the world abolished'.
Today is already very popular on YouTube, will also on these benefičních concerts?
Of course, and this in full conclusion, therefore, if we all manage and the end of the world will not arise...
It all Zazpívají interpreti on all three concerts in parallel.
Suddenly the anthem linking also in a unique direct transfer to the Czech TV.
Words on this song wrote and the main role of Jesus in klipu plays Tomé Hanák, it also contains Xindl X...
As you have got to cooperation with them?
We are also working with others, the Czech cultural stage, given that we are organising a lot of benefičních actions and concerts...
We are trying to is heavily involved in these projects.
It turned out that the majority of them are interested in cooperation with us and entertaining.
What will the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world?
On the equipment bezbariérového education centres Studeo sixth year, which we conduct with TAP in civic associations Jedličkově constitution.
For students are regularly attend school Jedličkova the constitution and address them in the activities, which is celebrating and interest.
The students themselves do not have the means to be issued for lektory ourselves, we are thus to enable it to them in this way.
In the framework of such Jedličkova constitution in the future there will be a separate building, in which we will transfer with this project.
Any the concert to address a few musical groups and performers.
According to what you have is singling out?
We have tried to draw up a programme which will address all the generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, I will speak Chinaski Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bártou, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří dry.
All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz.
You are planning any similar 'bombastické action' and in the future?
In May we will be the first time to act on the Prague Spring, so here we are certainly an interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year we would also like to zahráli in the Czech national home in New York, and I personally, while in the US, I would like to link and with the speech made in Washington and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not a minimalist, yet you have already spoken out for example, in Madrid, London, Brussels or in Moscow.
The TAP TAP however, it is a group, which is the disabled people.
As these routes zvládáte logistically and organisationally?
This is not so dreadful, as it appears.
We have five members of the electrical wheelchair, its carts must travel in zavazadlovém area, then, of course, vláčíme a large number of cargo and beden with the tools...
However, has always performed without problems, and the British Airways ČSA on us have been an excellently prepared, that I have wondered how many times when.
Even in Moscow, from which we have returned recently, this was without problems.
Thanks to the výjezdům abroad can you compare how individual different in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and so on.
What you have not yet met?
After the Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we have just in Russia have seen that in the East is still in full the start.
Compared to Prague is Moscow very bariérová, there is still an unusual to one of the electrical wheelchair himself in the city centre.
Nor is there such commonplaces, as do you prefer wheelchair users should that be in the lift.
Fortunately, there are also citizens' associations, which seeks to the problems of people with disabilities to draw your attention.
And what on the contrary, we still need to catch up with more advanced developing countries?
It is a lot of things, in which we are still behind...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the order of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid is perfectly normal that people with a heavy achievement of moving to the public can go for no to museums, everywhere...
But it is not the power of the usual, that a large number of people with disabilities more active part in social life, in that we are on the contrary, with The TAP TAP a bit ahead!
Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when the moment of us will be the major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things will start to change really.
So far these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
Had The TAP TAP is currently very popular, but a few years back what you in 1998 compelled to establish it?
I came as vychovatel into Jedličkova Constitution, where I was around many young people who were interested something to be addressed.
And since I myself muzikant hraji, among other things, on saxofon, so I, together with my colleague has zájmový music circle.
Well, and over time, we, as our host at Láďa Angelovič, a little bit out of hand (laughter).
The popularity but come in recent years, or wrong?
It is true that help us when we started to connect to the famous singers and also actively work to promote the band.
There has been us that the work that is not to see, in fact, as would not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, moreover, we can afford quality lektory, equipment and so on.
It was your order to follow it through with The TAP TAP this high?
Since the beginning, I felt the potential of the fact that it can do something else.
Showbusiness is overwhelmed things, where one have imitations of the other.
This is a logical, all new is accepted carefully and it takes time.
The things that are rare, it is very little, but I think I dare say that the TAP TAP are one of them.
The first impression in a man who us see the first time, it is, of course, one regret, this is natural...
But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with no achievement are suffering from all the abandoned beings, which we must regret.
These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that the fact that they have the necessary resources.
I say that, when something right people with achievement, so this is not the only for them, but for the whole of society.
Help this success also that you have a strict the head of the many people, as you said?
If we want to do good work, we need to be in many matters uncompromising and demand budgetary discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and with the head in the skies at, and when they discover that must twice week to go to the test, be at the product and spend a lot of time on the roads at concerts, so it is the enthusiasm quickly.
That cannot but is everywhere, in every group that wants to work, and which wants to achieve something.
At the moment has had The TAP TAP 20 members.
How many of them was in its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are open to the group, people are leaving and come, this cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the appetite for us, is always the door open
It will be held the day before the end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
Will take place in Prague Incheba areně, Brně Flédě and Ostrava Plynojemu for the participation of the 12 kapel and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities in the end of the evening will connect telemostem in a joint zpěvu songs band The TAP TAP 'The End of the world abolished'
The aim is to collect koncertu financial resources to equipment multifunctional bezbariérového education centres STUDEO in Jedličkově constitution in Prague in the volume of 25 million just over $10
Vstupné on concert is 400 just over $10 to 12 years, children have access to free tickets in předprodeji Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency adopted Poland for the twentieth a Member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which is a full member of the ESA has happened on 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the next few years contributed to a number of projects agencies.
However, the path of Poland into outer space has already begun much earlier.
Years in the space to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always with understanding.
I will mention, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw astronomical Observatory that on 6 December 1933 was the idea of its pioneering work The entry into force in the aerospace sector.
The idea of a young engineer (NAR. 1905) to audience unmoved and, after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr John Gadomski interested in his work.
Šternfeld in 1934 got for entry in the aerospace sector in France and the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho André Louis Hirscha.
Vzpomenutý doctor John Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major force behind the commemoration and aerospace sector.
In the Polish journals published by the hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on these vědním disciplines.
Gadomski has become the world ’ s known force behind the aerospace sector and its contribution has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the kráterů in the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
Already in 1925 was built railway drezína in Poland, which should be endowed with rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and are not known or the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for start-up far or to its curbing.
Information on this drezíně are known only from dobového of the press.
Since 1933 the rocket missiles began with the Polish artillery.
Research to ensure the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with, Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and, Professor Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From dochovaných materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted research.
In 1937, in the specialist of the press a proposal by fotoelektrické stíhací missiles, which proposed engineer Rohoziński and in the coming year to work - torpeda Rakieta powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engine.
Just before the war with all the projects military use of rocket technology to the Temporary the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all the work of the coordinated.
The Committee was based in 1937, but after two years of the activities of its activities to bring an end to the opening of the war.
Further work on the space industry, after the war in the Polish press are thanks to the work of the Polish astronautické society (the Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first time, there is mention of society in the November extradition year 1954 magazine Problemy, in which there are four more comprehensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, since, Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed the creation of a society, which will deal with kosmonautikou.
In that time, rozbíhaly projects artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is promising field.
Since the beginning of the 1956 the Polish astronautická society (PTA) snažia for accession to the International Federation (astronautické based 1951) and no longer fall, PTA has become a full member.
And in the coming year, the first President of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) has become a Vice-President of the International astronautické Federation.
He has carried out this function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 PTA is an important role in the development of a very successful Meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish by a missile, which carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 has been completed in 1957, the first place on 10 October launch 1958.
Rocket with dostupem 1800 metres has been long and its weight around 80 cm was less than 5 kg.
Later was built by an improved version RM-1A and in the summer started in 1959 Bledovské the desert flight tests two-stage rockets RM-2.
Rocket were long 1.4 standards and its weight was perhaps 11.5 kg.
Further development type of it should be able to the real scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have dostup to 14.5 km, and its task has been monitoring výškového the wind.
However, in 1962 was suspended the further development.
The heir to the first type of rockets RM has become a rocket Meteor-1 vyvíjená from 1962 to 1965.
Missile was designed as dvoustupňová, its the total length was 510 height and starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Were developed three types of (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that was different sizes area for scientific appliances.
In raketě Meteor-1A be available to the scope of the volume of 0.4 per litre of 0.34 Meteor-1B, on the volume and Meteor-1C, compared to the volume of a litre of.
The maximum dostup in all three types of was 37 km.
In 1965 and 1968 was in the aviation Institute the development of rockets Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket Meteor-2 should launch the weight of 380 kg and to be able to pass useful burden weighing 10 kg to the tune of around 60 km.
Subsequently were built version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Yet it is important to mention the entry of Poland to COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the framework programme Interkosmos involved in the space research area in the Soviet artificial družicích and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski become from Vladimir Remek the second interkosmonautem.
The abolition of the law on public work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court of law on public work.
The resolution on the public has caused a lively debate.
Certainly it will be interesting to look at the issue of a broader perspective.
Liberal oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect this means that the individual economic services, the national economic systems are in permanent conflict between us.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, nothing unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the unrestrained financial speculation.
The influence of the significant differences in the price of work, (wages) there is the price of tension.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation of producers are trying to import cheap goods to cope with competition by the 'podrazí' the price of competitor to tear down the greater share of the market and thus increase their profits.
In a massive scale, this means for the majority of businesses either translate production abroad, or there buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in the countries where the price of work in comparison with other economies high.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and therefore the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising necessarily the social state spending.
The whole situation is particularly the absolute unwillingness by entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to replace the economic and social a social damage which has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Reckless practices of private capital create in the individual economies situation, when governments of individual countries are forced to enter the competition with the aim of artificially to reduce social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give the private capital risking their own population regardless of social decline.
This manifests itself, in particular, the changes to the current legislation.
The aim is economically to force their own population adopted price diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is happening, on the one hand, the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In the West have existed for many years of public výdejny for the poor, who cannot own work to feed.
The number of these people are already in million.
In the framework of the increasing the competitiveness of the German economy are routinely to cases that properly employed people receive such a wage that they must pay to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was published in the case of the Federal auxiliary staff Reichstag.
The austerity measures of practically all the southern EU countries inevitably lead to the same situation, where people are under pressure from the disastrous decline of the social level of forced to either to emigrate as was the case in the 19th century, or živořit for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that in the country might one day will come private investment capital.
But here we need to ask where but to come?
If this will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or the Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media in the constituencies claim that the state cannot participate in the capital to their own economy that command economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state must not managing intervention to interfere in the economy.
Then we need to ask whether the private capital, does not affect, now actually govern policy and the state in their own egoistickém sense.
There is a clear answer yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and in all Member States of the presence of lobbies.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual advantages, the legislations, where it is virtually everything reprehensible, but nothing.
In the West, the situation is such that the State Department for a lack of financial resources commissioned by the drafting of the laws of the private legal companies, which are mostly in conjunction with the industry.
These proposals of the laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All the power of this is not from the people as it says the Constitution of the Western kind, but of the financially strong groups preferujících own interests.
It is clear now that a liberal democracy is now quickly into the situation, as it describes Appiános in my book The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Julius Caesar and Pompeia: 'State has already been long in total disintegration and authorities took over the violence.
In bribes, the illegal obtaining love and for the help of the cornerstones of or of swords.
Bribery and corruption bujely without hindrance and people coming to the elections with beforehand prodaným voice '...' charakterní people on the office neucházeli, so no one was as a result of this disruption has become the eight months without konzulů '....' Začalo is indeed to talk about the fact that the only cure in bad the situation is samovláda and that it is necessary to adopt strong man. "Appiános is thought to Pompeia, but it has become a Caesar, which has lasted democracy to also to enjoy self-government.
In conclusion, Like antice is the current society based on the reckless preference for their own benefit without regard to reach an society-wide interest.
Private capital is inherently able to understand and apply to reach an society-wide favour of.
The result is now, as well as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform the deeper nature.
Design of fascist and communist regimes, we must therefore seek in reckless the liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
In the current situation can be the demise of these systems in favour of the democracy of a liberal type seen as a break with the expectations of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the elites completely ignored in the future of the possible statisícové loss of life, the humanitarian and social disaster that we have already seeing now, together with the crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public work is not the solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at international, and the Interior European level will the government of the Czech Republic to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore logical.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen capital participation of the State in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: laboratory chaos.
'In the violence nothing is to come and nor can never' Sting Fragile in song whose main line in refrénu is' let us not forget, as we have křehcí '
'If it did not want my sons war, it would not be any' dying Gutele Schnaper wife, Mayer Amschela Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, vyrojilo a lot of response.
One is for Israel, they argue his right to self-defence and the Palestinians pasují into the role of terrorists, others promote the Palestinians, they argue racism State of Israel, genocide inflicted on the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel pasují to the role of the terrorist state.
I wonder who is periodically repeated waves of killing culprit and who, after all, today's the people of Israel, including the autonomous territories were born in the current political situation and the beginning of violence been seen before.
I am concerned to offer their readers perspective for the curtain, look at who, above all, it is already 95 years of tension (calculated from Balfourovy Declaration in November 1917) on a very small countries of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are backed up by the available historical facts are some of them derived on the basis of my own understanding of, or group of people who which is the main driver of the events of the modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every age we can find some kind of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so evident is, if it were always these figures, which absolutely autonomously governed by its actions and or whether for their throne was someone who usměrňoval their actions to advance vytýčenému objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth zkoncentrováno in the hands of a few individuals and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could not happen in the life of a generation.
Between these being felt in the rich families stands out one, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (whether someone is over them I do not know, but I do not rule out this) - Rothschieldové.
Power is no longer about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought already in the 1990 ’ s the 19th century, to stop linking its name with a highly criminal acts, in whose background and always stood for them a consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth or both.
Are the main shares in almost all central banks of the world and against the countries where shares in the Central Bank do not have to do or about the war (before by invading Afghanistan was 7 countries, for invading Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow Qaddafi left with only four, but meanwhile, Russia had been subordinated Central Bank of Russia ’ s government).
Anyone is this the family to resist, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Central Bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war issue their own (read the government) money, and was murdered in the year 1865 in the theatre.
JFK started own money and to abolish the Fed, was murdered 1963, Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Fed to prosecute them for starting the Great Depression of 1929.
Their desire for global power in 1859 years - 1871 to formulate a plan of three of the world wars, 33. zednářem the highest degree of insiders Alberto Pikem.
The first war should for the task to remove the great monarchistické States in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial empire, in particular, the United Kingdom and the third is to lead to the reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (the amount of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ekumenismus is nothing other than předpolí for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the Group of the richest families headed by Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and subsequent offering solutions (Order AB chao - the order of the chaos).
This solution but are false, and always lead to the deteriorating situation (see the establishment of the Fed, to avoid a repetition of crisis like the one which initiated in 1907).
So, after they have managed the murder of a successor to the throne habsburského R-U Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, to destroy the Tsarist Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended a sudden, militarily, economically unjustified, capitulation of Germany (no longer needed to war to the destruction of Czarist Russia), and then the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the emergence of the Second World War allowed bankers policy to create latentně conflict situation that Germany have imposed huge war reparations, thus create a prerequisite of radicalisation impoverished masses, and then selling them enough just to the Germans sufficiently strong, the culprits označujícího and simple solution to offer a leader, and the creation of a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play, and also played, as the fifth columnists, sparking a fire.
At the end of 19.století encourage Rothschieldové the establishment of the Zionist movement, which one strand of the creation of a Jewish state, preferenčně in the area of the historical Judeje with Jerusalem as the capital (a return to Sion).
Already mentioned Balfourova Declaration has created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to the first conflicts with the local the Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, if Hitler utrhl of the chain, on which it initially international bankers keep or what has been made in the plan is difficult to estimate in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in koncentrácích has created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948, and, as was war reparations Germany brewing 2.světovou war, was created by declaring a state of Israel, the focus of war third.
If it can unleash international bankers, will the Jewish people, as in the second, of the victims in the first line of the fighting, now or in general, together with the Arab Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a laboratory, the source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also in international scale (consider just how strongly divided between the people of the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in palestinsko - an Israeli conflict, where being breeds wrong in the never-ending the chain of violence, when at the beginning of all the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because as for us, podstrkují international bankers people to choose in the elections exclusively own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel and hawkish Netanyahu is a typical example fašizujícího, to international bankers loajálního, the policy, which is doing everything to trigger war with Iran, which would, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), risked global conflict and given the control of Iran over moving through Tunnel, who travel by 20% of all the world ’ s oil (shipping corridor is only 2 miles broad) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what the light of the now seems words, which now David Rockefeller in 1994: 'Jediné what we need is the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order. "
The new world order in their vision is the world by Mr and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The world, where there is every newly narozenému individuals implantován at birth chip that making it totally controlled being.
'A forcing all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have on the right hands or at the forefront of being branded as to buy or sell, who is not being on behalf of the beast or číslicí of its name.
This is important to understand: who has a sense be added together figure the beast.
This figure is man and that is the number of šestset sixty six '.
Film Argo: when is the worst, to call the Hollywood
In November 1979 invaded crowd Islamist students demonstrating the American Embassy in Tehran and zajal 52 diplomats hostage.
Should be released in exchange for the deposed the Shah Mohammed Rézu Páhlavího that after the revolution fled to the US, which were a patron of his regime for several decades.
The situation for the US administration did not offer a positive outcome of the Shah - thrown overboard could not afford, because it would fundamentally threaten the trust of the allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
This was a blow for the prestige of the United States, which later was deepened fiasco attempt to free the hostages force.
The imprisonment of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, then what the negotiations to alžírská government.
Their plight at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the defeat of the Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections 1980.
Film režírujícího actors Ben Afflecka Argo describes the one episode of the history of America, which brought a small victory.
Just before memberships Embassy from it have six workers.
Following the difficult peripetiích rezidenci ended up in the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, has helped while unsubstantiated nom story - went to the Canadian passports as Members of the film staff, which in the country obhlížel locations for recording with video a science-fiction velkofilmu.
The combination of genres
The plan, who invented an expert on 'exfiltraci' Tony Mendez, require the cooperation Hollywood.
To legend be credible, talked about the film project in the specialist journals, there were a press conference, the fictional productive society should the real office.
The details of the operations were concealed a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendeze.
Affleckův the film is a special a combination of more genres.
On the one hand, realistically pojatý political whodunit, at the same time, the so-called 'caper movie', the story of vydařeného stunt podrazu - an example of this can be a series of Dannyho parťáků.
In the movie so by mood - on the one hand, the broad dokumentárně sequence of Tehran (in titulkové sequence are ukazovány ikonické dobové photographs of events and the way in which were the same situation shown satellite in the film - large disparities in are not).
On the other hand, odlehčené passages from Hollywood, pojednané with the ironic and a slight exaggeration.
And then the scene of the headquarters of the CIA and the other institutions -muži in suits pick up the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of, in the phone...
Benovi Affleckovi is a remarkable that have a career.
From vysmívaného actors became respected Director and also its arts ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is the third celovečerní film, after the dark krimi Gone The baby Gone (2007) and thrilleru City (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleckův scan, which is not taking place in Boston režisérově home.
The sense of an atmosphere of jobs was between the characteristics that režisérovy older films place over hollywoodský standard.
And Affleck Argu it also apparent in Tehran, where 'plays a' Canada.
The best scene in the film are taking place in the streets in rekonstruování real sequence of events - the opening of the fall of the embassies is impressive in its clarity, which, at the same time recording conveys emoci confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when somewhere along moving in the history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in the arenas of fabricated (a false staff to Tehran the bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The Director, to deal with vyprávěný story does not offer actually power in the film sense napínavých scenes.
Quite successfully with the little is working, sometimes, the reality of something přimyslí - there has not everything so neatly (scene in which the impending crisis in Tehran airports will call from in America and honička after overturned operate rather far-fetched).
But it is a weakness Arga roztěkanost resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are as Hollywood aides very charming, their figures, but have deserved more space and are not in the movie by far the only.
Affleckův film a bit of losing a dramatic move, it is showing that it is possible to monitor with moderate interest, to pay tribute to the implementation and retro style evoking thrillers the 1970 ’ s.
But there is difficult.
As a reminder of the one has a vibrant history and proof, as excessive are ideas about všemocných and vševědoucích secret services, but it will be enough.
The rules for overselling balónků, bananas and the travelling circus
The servers www.bankovnipoplatky.com every year, which declares polled on the most absurd bank levy, has now decided to declare competition on the 'most of the regulation or ideas from the EU'.
'led us to the final event, when the EU is planning to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the management of large European companies,' said the right of the organiser of an exit Patrik Nacher.
Between nominovanými absurditami is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court on the harmonisation of rates insurance premiums for men and women.
Yet, at the same time, women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiaries, because they are for the insurance companies objectively less risk.
'The further incredible ideas from the EU can people to nominate by the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, 'inform Nacher.
Between the controversial regulation of the EU are even mandatory admixing biosložek in the fuel, which is detrimental to the nature, to ban the use of mercury teploměrů reliable, that just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the Directive on the size of slepičích cages because of this year, which significantly expensive eggs.
The criticism before faced also the de facto a ban on the use of the expression pomazánkové butter or the decommissioning of light bulbs from sales.
The quality of the bananas are to have 14 centimeters
The Union's apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels usually defend a State or group of states (as the Czech Republic now and the threat of veto promotes the demands of our banks).
The interests of lobbies were also for the fact that, for example, bananas the highest quality in the Union to achieve the length of at least 14 height and are not allowed to run a 'an anomalous the sharpness of the'.
The European Commission to defend the fact that only harmonises the existing national standards, which occurred with the trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables, the EU despite the opposition of some states změkčila with regard to the fact that the existing directive lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in anketě can also be the last year's EU regulation, which must be sold nafukovacích balónků obligatory warnings that it is children younger 8 years must not expand without supervision of adults.
The EU has been invoked the US research, according to which are balloons between the toys the leading cause of death in children on choking.
Similar restrictions now applies to children in 14 years in foukání into pouťových frkaček.
Curious ideas are born and at home
Quite absurd it is then and the rule of European officials - anyone who is in the EU some official position, cannot with regard to the sensitivity of the subject for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece must instead to talk about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The servers Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the liberal economists laissez Faire nominoval to further apart from some of the above absurdities endorsed the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food stocks, which could find on the territory of the Czech Republic in the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic, then crossed for example, the amounts on the canned fungi, for which he was threatened with high fine.
The organisers of a further even the idea to pay some countries that do not have the Sea, and the idea of the subsidies to the request for obtaining subsidies.
These ideas, however, there are in Brussels, but in Prague.
'We are handicapováni the fact that we do not have the Sea.
We ask the European Union on the reimbursement, 'said in the autumn 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument say that, for us urodilo a lot of grain and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should become a full depots, which had to export.
For that is the Czech Republic, we should continue to ports Palase to pay the EU according to the hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission published the Czech Republic to end by organised tendr on the purchase of grain from countries which do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive subsidies offering communities the Ministry of Regional Development controlled Minister Paul German (US-DEU), specifically, should go to craft a request for the subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: a bizarre regulation are the exception of
The regulation is in the Member States easily targeted criticism, the efforts of EU regulation and, at the same time, on the effective functioning and development throughout the Union, according to a number of experts rather deserve recognition.
More serious problem is, according to the experts, for example, the use of the EU subsidies for projects that have not something in common with the deepening of the European integration, but we in the budget negotiations force the Member States.
Emotions between the Czechs is that, as well as other countries of the Union must the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight on the right to specific labelling of their traditional products, and not always in this struggle will succeed.
The Czechs following six-year fight with the Germans and protect the Austrians olomouckých tvarůžků, but the domestic rum, whose tradition for us back to the 19th century, had our producers be changed to tuzemák.
Name rum can be only products of the cane destilátu, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products the EU in society and internationally renowned cheeses feta gorgonzola, marcipánu from the German Lübecku or parmské ham already, for example, Karlovarské suchary, pohořelický and třeboňský carp and žatecký hop.
The safeguard a sign of the EU can be proud of also pardubický perník and hořické trubičky.
People want to were Republic, but I am amateur, claims Okamura
Mr senátore, as the man that it wants to run for President?
This is not about this, be Senator or President.
If it in our country has worked without problems, and nowhere nekandiduji.
But I cannot see how the last twenty years of the country rozkrádá, as thieves' athletes running, people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I did not have the ambition be policies.
But when I see something that I do not like, so I am trying to come up with a solution to change.
And as I have already been forty and I am an independent nestraník, I have no choice, as things affect than Senator or run for president.
You have received by the Senate, but soon you have embarked on the Presidency.
Neotáčíte turned their backs on the people who elected by you?
All the time I have said that, in the battle for the Presidency, I will go according to the outcome in the Senate elections.
Later, I have made it clear that, if I am elected Senator, I am going to run for president.
My aim but it is not function, as is the instrument, as I can realise their vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate.
The problem but it is not only that, as a nation nadáváme in a bar and television, but that the trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.
To join in the media, which the person dehonestují and which confuse the freedom of speech, freedom of lying.
For me to be said that uplácím journalists or that I was Adviser George Paroubka.
Let us to your visions.
In the battle for the Presidency you pause with the proposition material and criminal liability of politicians, and the feedback property of over 20 million.
To this, you need to change the law.
As the President but such power and the Senate you do not only as a whole can propose laws.
How do you intend to resolve it?
When I as a citizen průvodcovství lobbied for this to be free of business, to carry this through.
The problem is politicking - when someone will come up with a good proposal from the left or right, naschvál to reject, and it is delaying the citizens.
As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain the support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without the party a compartmentalised approach and dogmas, I can take something that is the best for our country, from all sides and apply it.
Do you see it rather as a man of the right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that I am more people are left.
For me is not important, if a little towards the left, or a bit of transport.
For me, it is important to go forward.
This is not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to link the people.
Always I will support any public good solution, although it will propose the CPBM or ODS, and so I will be against a bad idea.
Čertíte, when someone will tell you that you are a populist.
But nedokazujete that what you said?
When tvoříte byznysplán in a firm, so you are also an ideal objective and vision.
And you are trying to bring.
Someone this may be called populism, but all the proposals that I am referring to, in the world of work, or about them outstanding specialists.
But without the support of Parliament you zbydou only slogans.
And with the long-term nevystačíte in politics.
Or do you think that, if you for people to go and to talk to them, that you will be able to impose, for example, the penal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing policy, journalists and the public and to try to your side to this through.
If I was elected President, is not a problem to hold televised direct transfer, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact the material and criminal responsibility for the policy, officers, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually had to say why do not want it.
When will be strong personality, which will be pojmenovávat abuses, we can push for the political scene.
Take the direct election of President, this was the credit of public pressure.
Frankly, I say that I am amateur that I am neither a genius, or intellectual.
For their views and vision I am trying to seek allies.
In politics, I have only just begun and for its programme I will try to gain the support of the majority.
I am trying to move things alone, if this does not, for six years, I will end and I will come back to the private sector.
This is a little, as would Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
No spasitel I am not.
I know that in one person I will not do anything, I am therefore obcházel a number of people, whether it would also who in the Senate.
I went for Radimem Jančurou, he refused because of the amount of work.
So I am at least support investigative journalist, Jan Lorencovou, which rozkrývala fraud in small topnými oil.
He ran I agree that people are really dissatisfied, but now I am in the balance.
Sixty per cent of people not to the elections and those who followed, the majority of the elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, so we have only two independent.
People navolili the Senate, so that the changes are difficult to promote.
Nevertheless, I will fight for their vision, such as for the direct election of the mayors or leaders.
You are thinking about the establishment of their own party?
I am still not reflected, because I do not have time to examining the clean past every potential straníka, and that is something that I do not have the money.
I do not have the money or for the presidential campaign, to my transparent account is only 20 000.
You do not have the money?
You talk about property confessions, what is it your?
Private property I augur for about 60 million.
In Prague have the plot of land for around 25 million, apartment in ten million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of artistic works for about ten million, Aston Martin, 3.5 million and damage Superb for a million and then I have a few million to account.
Incidentally, Aston Martin I am therefore, that it was my klukovský dream - always much enjoyed James Bond, which was in a car, courteous to women and, at the same time, fought against the wrongs and excesses.
You are going Aston Martin, you have property for 60 million and you do not have the money on the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money into this power to give you do not want.
This is not very convincing.
I do not have the 15 million for the campaign.
This, I have to get into debt?
In the campaign, I have already vrazil 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsor, shows that my programme about is not such an interest.
And I do not have the obligation to pay for their campaign.
The cost of the campaign me in effect cover this, what I will receive senátorský pay.
But it would nevyžil, for example, I could not pay son the English school, which is 30 000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, and nowhere nekandiduji.
So you will continue to do business, you can live?
You have said that these activities utlumíte?
But this has nothing to do with the levels of pay.
As I promised, their activities I am partly muted.
For example, jednatelem cestovky in the spring will be my Representative.
People would like to be samaritán, which will save Republic.
But I also of something I need to live.
How much you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 000, which I take further.
And if I were President, I would like to end their business.
You will find the whole discussion in the weekly extradition Rights.
The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure combat are only in the heads of Spijkenisse - for example, and recently built Montenegro books - 2 images
'For building I find a light-hearted, looks futuristicky. Finally, it is once again to see something interesting,' says Lisette Verhaig, which is around for the periphery of the roads.
Stefan Spermon, it techniques in the near large business, is: 'Ovšem, the House is a nice'.
However, I wonder what even today, we need a library.
All have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily no one who are not, or yes?
Sídliště Spijkenisse, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
This stupid to resolve the situation was taken a few years ago the decision to contribute to the general education and to stand up to seven nicely pomalovaných železobetonových miniatur fictitious bridges, which are vyobrazené on euro notes.
The success of the educational offensive but was not the sheer.
And so town councillors know that there is no longer the only opportunity to become the masters of the statistics: we must have the library!
Winy Maas of rotterdamského architectural from studio MVRDV, master wildly bold sloupcových graphs and zhotovitel vtipných, often even cynical buildings, has adopted the matter with the usual for competition and on the negotiations in 2003, he appeared with five books under the arm and úšklebkem on my face.
And, while the Commission still ohromeně rozhlížela around and krčila shrug, vršil an insolent Maas their not be handing out favors the size and its aktivisticky zdůvodněnou conclude the words' Milá urban communities! '
So this is my proposal to Montenegro books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later was mountain for EUR 30 million navršena.
It is part of revitalizačního project, which includes also underground car park, supermarket, the post and several of the surrounding residential and ordinary houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November was honoured with Montenegro of books second place 'Best Library of NL 2012'.
The project is, moreover, the designation of the cost of Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Maloměstská šeď, which has been unable to offer more than a post-modern walking zone and extraordinarily ugly the municipalities, whose White a façade of you would rather expected mlékárnu, it is thanks to the richer a bit of contemporary architecture.
But, above all, it is now Spijkenisse the first public cultural build in the history of their existence.
A long way to book
The first impression: the field of eldorádo under poklopem on cheese.
A means of masivu mountain drive the lift, but the real spatial and passions when you will find the field of overcoming pěším topography.
From all sides prosklený interiér is a positive note and transparent, podlaha from páleného kabřince and elegant street lucerny clearly express the atmosphere of public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see parkové lavičky, dog and kluky and holky, who play football.
And everywhere Paper, books, books.
'Normálně is the shelves with books along fronts, and in the midst of a dark is a large space, which is usually neútulný and impersonal,' says Winy Maas.
We have the classic spatial configuration challenge the upside down and room for readers we vysunuli from the inside out.
Vnitřek Montenegro books is cleverly utilised: in the centre of the office, the Internet library, šachový club, ecological centre and ústředna house-to-house technology.
Special potěchou are black policy on the books, which are one obložením the confines of, and sometimes one parapetem zábradlím stairs.

Szabo: 'the Germans must play a greater role of the'
Germany abstained in the decision-making process for the adoption of Palestine.
According to expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa the Berlin poised to close the edge of diplomacy.
The Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of a week, the first signal that would vote against the proposal for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel cautious.
But at the same time, I think that will not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, would be too critical of Israel.
In the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstentions, when it comes to establishing a no-fly zone.
This ultimately put NATO.
It is for Germany difficult to take in the case of serious international issues is a clear position?
Yes, it is the case.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and this direction from the policy, which was so to speak, guided by the US, towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult, that the Europeans have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are therefore between the two lines.
It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but are not are used to this.
I think of it in its role as the only have, but they are on the road to 'more normal' foreign policy.
In foreign policy, which are in France or Britain.
What specifically means' normal 'foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows the readiness to take in the case of national interests and positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests of Germany are in a certain degree of other than the economic interests of other major powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a large market outlets in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful to neodstrašilo the public, but neither the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
I would not like this, but nor to ascribe too great importance, this is not completely one-sided relationship.
However, in any case, it plays an important role in the German thinking.
Germany to damage relations with the US, when Germany in the case of both the important decisions abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the US is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not think that this was a watershed as dramatic as in the issue of Libya.
Perhaps for this are extracted Germany even some respect.
It signals that must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, in contrast, have spoken out clearly for the veto.
There are between the US and many European nations differences of opinion?
These differences exist in the wake of America ’ s internal policy has always.
I think that the Obama administration has some secret by a great deal of sympathy for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation cannot this position, of course, a publicly.
I think that the diversity of views really are not so great, as is always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and the Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama somehow power is not entirely happy with Netanyahu ’ s policy.
Germany is not difficult to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that this is exactly what the Germans difficult.
For the Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, which is currently not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and they must instead, to take things forward from its own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany would take a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
For Germany, of course, it is not easy, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.
This was always a sensitive subject.
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as an important international player? wants to take a leading role at all?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still used this is still an unpleasant, and for this country is, for obvious reasons still difficult to play a greater role.
When you look, for instance, on the European crisis, as always, when Germany will adopt a greater role, it will create protiněmecké sentiment.
It does not facilitate the Germans.
Indeed, this is the old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, it is Germany in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for the various neighbours and the views and this is not easy.
The impact of the US in European policy now is constantly falling, the EU, however, this vacuum currently nevyplňuje. Here otherwise there is?
The Germans simply will have to play a greater role.
Although they do not like is them uncomfortable and will do it is much neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

'The protection of trademarks' in China: when are puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is world-renowned a label Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo programme?
For this is the label, which is completely officially registered in China, but with the original firm has nothing to do.
However, the protection of so long as it is nezažalují real owners of the label.
And even then it is not clear whether domohou rights.
'For foreigners in China is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their own brands,' says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office Taylor Wessing which specialises in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week přistane on my psacím the table a new case.
Moreover, already counterfeiters just a few points, so that they can apply their own brands.
From the label Gucci bags, for example, will become Lu-Gucci Prada and instead of having to register Prada-Kny.
In this way are legally kopírovány and German firms, be the manufacturer of sporting goods puma.
Pattloch opens pořadač of trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, there has left a Chinese company to protect the brand Zegna DF puma. An artificial the name parazituje also on the House Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are the champions of the world in copying and infringements of intellectual property.
In large cities are několikapatrové trade homes, where almost exclusively sell counterfeit goods.
Pattlochovy cases are but the other. Of the mandate of their mandantů goes against the Chinese firms have received from Trademark Office entirely officially the right to use the label, which is already protected elsewhere.
This is something that the Chinese call 'Bang Mingpai', into the label.
This word focuses on the 'Bang Dakuan'.
This meant that fishes rich women, men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
'that is to the detriment of trade, we must combat it,' calls on the Pattloch.
'label to dilute, a monopoly will disappear, damage to the image is enormous.'
The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries run into millions, above all for expensive demonstration of products.
According to data society for research market CLSA China with a volume of EUR 15 billion a year's third largest market luxury goods and market, which is growing quickly as possible.
Výmazu dubious records in the register brands can be achieved, however difficult and something that cost.
Management can be stretched to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells to the cases where the Court rejected claims, because the title of a vytýkaný after a long time, the duration of the 'market reality'.
When is the plaintiffs misfortune must plagiátorovi even to pay, because the damage to his brand in China, says Pattloch.
There is sometimes the law of the jungle.
Known cases concern and grafických elements.
In 2009, lost Daimler legal dispute with the producer of construction machinery Sany, enterprise, which recently took the German manufacturers pumps to betonovou a mixture of Putzmeister.
Therefore, to date, the Chinese are allowed to use emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes.
Society Geely, which should buy Volvo, originally used modrobílé a logo which resembled the BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to a logo to change.
The manufacturer fashionable goods Lacoste lost in China with padělateli of Hong Kong and Singapore, who is known crocodile deviously promised in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
While Známkový office CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to the very small number of employees and space.
But in the last year, the supposedly 'the work of the emergency situation has returned to normal'.
For example, the number of raw management about the opposition fell 22%.
Closed there were 57 000 of these cases, on the 75% more than in the previous year.
Yet still waiting for the office 81 500 on the processing of complaints.
Something against to take it is expensive
As is the case in China, are often this imponující figures.
Last year was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million of the applications for the protection of the label, which is almost a third more than the year 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China podesáté for us is the list of the new applications from around the world.
This also applies to the number of all existing protective labels - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 was in charges selected 1.8 billion yuan.
Simple terms, this means that every minute in the average cost 1280 renminbi, or €160.
To start against this dispute is multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
This concern for more than seven years is fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans have achieved that has been repealed its illegal production imitovaných car parts.
But China ’ s padělatel ensure the rights to the label Freudenberg to continue.
We failed to ourselves, as in Germany cannot be protected, says surname Hanno Wentzler, President of the company management Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
Známkový office CTMO then also order the Munich firms rejected.
In the other two instancích may Freudenberg domohl rights, but opponents in the dispute is fighting further still.
We need to be a terrible careful
Now is the issue being discussed with the Supreme Court.
Wentzler my confidence that will lead to a good thing and praises the end of the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: 'Proceedings is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and anxiety.'
Internal costs cannot be measured. In the archive of companies had even see a hundred years old files, to put forward the evidence.
Five years ago society Freudenberg counterparties in vain offered 'high šestimístnou amount in euros' for the purpose of a settlement.
'In this, you can see, what does that mean for us,' says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will be hit, and Europe.
And this in the case, when there imitators ensure exposed the label.
A Chinese manufacturers in Germany, for example, I join the label Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of commercial activities, the concern of the long to pay, yet managed to avert the registration.
'It is to be careful not to be a terrible,' says Wentzler.
He also solicitor Pattloch advises the German companies to be very careful in the trade with China.
It is not enough to rely on the international známková the rights of foreigners would rather. Should 'everything in any way it is worth protecting, apply in China,' says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if society Freudenberg in the last act of his drama of the deaths, then perhaps will have to pay for giving licensing fees own name, explains Wentzler.
Or will we be in the disputed segment pushed from the market.
The World day against AIDS: dupání, singing, aid
Calculated in testing the College Imbongi - and in Swaziland have the pleasure of orphans after the parents, who died on AIDS.
The story of the link that sets a much more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, there is dupání: kovbojské high shoes, Basketball shoes, dámské lodičky and male mokasíny are seeking to trading tact and quickly find it.
Jeden-dva-tři-čtyři.
Then slowly vzedmou voices singers - alt, Bas, tenor and soprán - urged mámí and prosecute.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa almost a rising tide lifts from its textile shoes, combining the voices of its vláčně the wild gestures.
It is Monday evening. In the music of the Institute medical psychology calculated in testing the College Imbongi a new song.
It came to 50 zpěvaček and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from the female researchers human genetics after domovníka.
'transparency' Obani 'is not easy composition, every sborový voice has a different text and even in very a foreign language - Zulu, which is eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of the Swaziland.
Aid to self-help
UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, it is estimated that around the world live around 34 million people who are infikováni the HIV virus.
For this 23.5 million live in the South Africa.
In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after the parents, who died on AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40% of the population.
For 180 orphans after the parents, who died on AIDS, in the village Esitjeni found an Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attends school of the second instance.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can take the patronizing.
Guarantees child the tuition fees, the school of uniform and one hot food a day in Gogo-centru.
Imbongi means in the language of Zulu 'vypravěč stories' or 'whoever extols'.
Plynnou bantuštinou can one speak in this area, only sing.
For almost ten years nacvičuje College songs in the foreign soft speech and sometimes it is also brings back where originally come: to the South Africa.
In the air distances 8 733 kilometres from is calculated in the north-east of the village Esitjeni Svazijského Kingdom, which is dependent on mohutnosti of the votes of the German College.
Forty per cent is infikováno
There are some 2,000 people, some even in simple clay or of straw huts. A large majority of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have already has the parents, as they have yielded to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, the whole stůně Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infikovanosti, the lowest life expectancy around the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision předkožky that demonstrably reduces the risk of infection about half the population does not accept.
More than forty per cent of people in Swaziland wear the virus weakened immunity in each other. It is rare that are dying in less than 30 years.
This was in the village of a common path for Africa in the spring 2005. Above all, however, members of the Imbongi saw many children in the streets, which was not only for parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without ukončeného of school education are not in a poor country has no chance.
Initially, it was still private use of individuals, which for a few euros per year to send a child to school and to give it a hot food on a daily basis.
However, already a year later, was founded a society of 'Voices for Africa', which has since the old of orphans after the parents, who died on AIDS, almost professionally.
The facts of sexually transmitted infekcích
That is the most serious sexually transmitted disease?
They belong to bakteriálním SPI syfilis, chlamydie and kapavka (gonorea).
Frequent virovými SPI, HIV, human papilomaviry, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Muňky and svrab belong to parazitárním SPI.
Who belong to the groups most affected?
Syfilis and kapavka there are, above all, for men, who have sex with men.
Constitutions Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four of the five all cases syfilidy that have been reported in Germany, are transmitted sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often, chlamydiové infection trichomonády, kandidóza (blight), kapavka and human papilomaviry.
HIV is between heterosexuálními adults with us the extended relatively little, but the roughly 20% of newly infected with HIV, for this group.
Between juveniles of the infection chlamydiové are significantly more often than other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people from 15 to 25 years.
For us, moreover, between juveniles are often human papilomaviry.
How has the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of people infected syfilidou, according to the Constitution of Robert Kocha 1697 diseases in 2001 to more than doubled 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections since 2007.
The year 2011 was around 2 700 cases.
This is about a tenth of less than a year before.
What the symptoms of the sexual disease?
Infectious diseases may cause vředy in the area of mutilation, difficulties in močení, výtok, pain in podbřišku and puchýřky or bradavice.
Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will remain therefore nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
The risk of contagion can reduce the use of condoms, however, do not offer 100% of the protection.
As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can partly be transferred to and infections of the mess and close the physical contact.
Therefore, the experts are recommending, especially in the case of the frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular investigation.
In the event of early diagnosis is possible to cure the most SPI and to prevent the subsequent consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, represent darům and last but not least, honorářům that the College earns zpíváním around the Germany, will be among some money.
'In all, we have already to Esitjeni sent roughly EUR 200 000,' says the Chair of the club of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany manages in the village Zodwa Dlamini, confident, the woman can impose.
Care also about orphaned children find shelter, for example, in some of grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of Zulu says the old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken and 14 of orphans, give them the roof and care about children attend every day in time in uniforms to school.
Children who have no one should not go to shelter to Khanyisile, solitary woman by society as well as the two kuchařky, which makes a day for more than 200 of hungry children.
'Voices for Africa' moreover, established a school sewing, it has two kurníky and together with the American health organisations PSI zařídilo that many people in the village of HIV test allowed to do.
This is not granted. Although it is the disease in the whole country so clear, however, all the remaining silent.
The King of the 14 wives
'AIDS is an absolute taboo,' says Annette Lennartz, 'because it has to do with the sexuality.'
In fact, quite strange in a country where King officially keeps 14 of the spouses.
The last an absolutist monarch Black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his nemírným lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state approved by way of life is, among other things, the blame for the fact that the HIV virus in the past decades so quickly.
But also many migrant workers who, the virus roznesli after the country.
Annette Lennartz says that the use of condoms, while on any corner for free, the 'but no one is not used.
Culture is different - non-proprietary contact '.
At least a little to support cultural exchange, travel College Imbongi one in two, three years together for the South Africa and singing the songs full of mourning, militancy, confidence in the future and self-confidence black, which many in the southern tip of the dark continent know from the time of apartheid.
Bus full of white people who sings songs in the language of the struggle - a prize brings not only the mood and joy, but also already vyloudilo tears for many wild border soldiers.
The road is always and in the Esitjeni, where the singers visit children, over which they have the patronizing.
Although this vesničku hardly you will find on the map, in the river Ezulweni is more than known.
'go into Esitjeni, there is light, "they say the people there.
And when you go back to calculated, which is here straight line 8733 kilometres to dupajícím zpěvákům in provisionally on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that shines a light here.
Messenger: NASA has appeared on the ice Merkuru
Probe Messenger found evidence that it is on the planet Merkur the ice.
Ice receded could have the width to 20 metres.
The US, the National Aeronautics and kosmonautiku (NASA) has shown the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although the closest to work in the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by the three studies that on Thursday, published a scientific journal 'Science'.
Probe Messenger found evidence that in the area of this planet, which lies in continuing the shadows, there is ice receded.
This is supposedly at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even to 20 metres strong.
This water has apparently from komet or perhaps even from asteroids, which in Merkuru hit.
But let us not give a ruling of the ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leading scientists working on sondě Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the Merkuru can achieve when 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we could help to clarify how the water and other basic elements of life in other areas of the solar system.

One of the largest and most incisive images Hubbleova teleskopu: vírová galaxy
The images spirálních galaxií, according to its vybarvení become real art parts.
The scope, published by the European Southern Observatory, a few thousand light years removed from the mlhovinu Trifid in souhvězdí střelce.
The title Trifid comes from Latin words' trifidus' (a divided into three parts, trojklanný), since the dark swathes of the dust divided žhoucí the heart of this star maternity wards into three parts.
In souhvězdí Hadonoše astronomové took photos of a precursor of space rainfall: 400 million light years away from the Earth is to drive the core of the two such fluid galaxií and must inevitably be a crash.

Scientists believe that only shortly after Velkém bang, when he was in the space mostly hydrogen.
Our views into space telescopes: the most important
Dalekohled supposedly invented a year 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Even before the Galileo Galilei it a year later used to observing the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical dalekohledů still fleet - which has grown and views, which is mediated by, are still further.
The biggest dalekohledem in the world was for 30 years, since 1947 to 1975, Haleův teleskop on the Observatory Palomar in the vicinity of San Diego.
The mirror on this picture should the average of five metres.
In the US Arizona are Large Telescope Binocular.
It allows insight into space through two a, of which each a average 8.4 metres.
Vnitřek gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a reflection of the measure in the average 10.4 metres.
A reflection of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is to be segmented uspořily costs.
Yet his average is around 11 metres.
The disadvantage of cheap way: teleskop construction is ensured hákovadlem in výškovém angle, which is limited his mobility.
In point is also výškovém fixován teleskop Hobby-Eberly in Texas.
It is high increase in its peculiarities světelného the flow of.

Two Keckovy dalekohledy on Mauna Havajské KEA in 2007 were regarded as the largest in the world.
They offer two the mirror, each with an average of 10 metres.
Keckovy dalekohledy are part of the Observatory Mauna KEA which, among them is seen in the space and through teleskopu Subaru and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna KEA has created a new giant teleskop - with třicetimetrovým average the mirror.
Here it can you admire the picture.

For this, however, there are no reliable data, since Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measuring the point has been for decades to the fact that it is on Merkuru the ice.
Thanks to sondě Messenger, which was sent in 2004 and is the first that money circulating around Merkuru, scientists have now certainty.

Driving pohořím Talyš we can call it a romantic.
Mikrobus rachotí by road along with many zatáčkami densely forested the hills, predatory rivers and simple selských stavení.
Everything is green and šťavnaté, it almost seems that we are in Schwarzwaldu.
However, that there is the ultimate the south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is remote only a few kilometres.
Here, the Caucasus ethnic group Talyšů, of which is not very well known, in addition, that is perfectly persky and ázerbájdžánsky and dies at the very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This city prides himself on too monumental architecture of the Soviet times, which is in a scenic the mountain landscape somehow not appropriate.
Tourists from Europe failing here. The arrival of Azerbaijan ’ s capital city Baku is too difficult.
On 323 kilometres is needed, eight hours, since the roads is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth, for which countries owe naftě in the Caspian Sea, still not here to the countryside.
Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is, however, convinced that Lerik it has to become a tourist attraction.
'Baku in May famous the price of the Eurovision Song Contest - and we have the next year we will have a festival the oldest people in the world,' says Fatulajeva.
It is the head of the Museum of longevity, about a single in the world.
Here is documented the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšů of the environment, who are older hundred years. Fatulajeva shows the black and white foto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years.
In the age of 136 years to a child.
However, it is a star this museum pastevec sheep Şirali Müslümov, which allegedly been 168 years.
Birth certificate, however, there is.
And, given that the oldest person with the evidence was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův age of extremely dubious.
'Narodil in the area of 1805 and 1973 died, the' explains Fatulajeva.
This man was supposedly three times ženat and 23 of the child. In the age of 136, even a daughter.
Nezmýlil therefore Şirali Müslümov in their age of a few dozen years?
For many years of people in Central Asia, however, also heard Rembrandt Scholz, Max Plancka gerontolog Constitution in Rostocku.
'a conspicuously many people live in certain areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza in Pakistan, "says the Scholz,' also in Sardinia live extremely many very old men '.
Due to the lack of a dossier over, however, cannot be no scientific evidence on age, especially when there are not the matriky.
Every day the glass rozpuštěného butter
But the fact is that people in the region around Leriku live a biblical age remarkably often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are older 100 years.
So why live here in the south of so many years of the people?
Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzadeh this explains the special genes Talyšů.
The head of museums Fatuljeva on the contrary, they believe that this lies in the diet.
However, the fact that it is restricted diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of whom a day drink a glass rozpuštěného butter, it is so healthy, from bromatologického point of view, it is plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, which maintains young people? in Cengemiranu, tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, live Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In 97 years on it is this geographical breadth still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which says that has 143 offspring, live in simple wooden house that is typical of the whole of the Caucasus region.
Sit on the ground with máselnicí that tirelessly kolíbá.
Under one roof lives here of eight people, including one of the sons Mirzajevy and daughter. Both are already long grandparents.
Around poskakují, and two small children.
In the kitchen for guests is preparing a tea, which is given in typical břichatých glasses' armadu '.
The White teeth Mirzajevy is a perfect a number of and under šátkem there is a long dark blond copy, which we have before us proudly reveals her son.
I have always myla hair milk market, so I nevypadaly and keep the colour.
'I, too, I never used šampon,' says Mirzajeva.
Monthly pension rights to life is enough
Jedla always just what came from its own of Justice, tomatoes, potatoes Games.
For their whole life I am not one single time myself in the supermarket food.
Then tells me about his men, which was in the army.
The worst it was during the Second World War.
But všecko to improve, when veslo taken over the 'beloved father' Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda is from the mouths of the old women have looked strange.
But the cult, which is being done about figures, the father of the peoples, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
In power in 2003, then took veslo his son, Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from pittance.
Mirzajeva receive monthly pension 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euros). This is on the conditions of cash, from which could well make ends meet.
And perhaps is right and long zešedivělý son Mirzajevy: 'old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture'.
They live in the midst of the great family, are milováni, opečováváni and are happy.
If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of 'human rights' in the constitution is lacking
To Cairo returned revolution.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo revealed deep division of the country.
Sharply discussion on the future of the constitution based on Sharia law.
Egypt ’ s President nešetřil pathos.
We need to create a transition.
'A for the fact that we can achieve that, I am responsible, before the people and before God,' said in the state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but, above all, the Christian the Copts, Liberals, an enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
They all, still hopelessly, bickering in a confused the opposition, they fear.
The fear of a 'God State' for the Nile released at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost omluvně told that temporarily reduced competence of the Constitutional Court and extend those their to 'save revolution'.
However, what it wants 61letý engineer, which has the title of the doctor American universities in the southern California, really to save, in that do not have the Egyptians nor the world.
The judiciary is to be deprived of their power?
234, the paragraphs suggesting stohlavé the constituent assembly with the predominance of the Islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém late-night marathon, partly, cause concern.
As well as in previous constitutions, it is said in this proposal, that the jurisdiction is based on 'the principles of Islamic law'.
But what it means' of the principle of '?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and can be feared that Islamists this obscure the wording and its associated legal free space use for stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least it highlights the newly added paragraph: in all matters relating to sharia, it is necessary to deal with the University of Manchester al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with great influence on the whole of the Sunni Islam.
This does not, but may mean that klérus will carry out supervision of the legislation, which would bring justice de facto imprisonment clear-headedness.
In the draft constitution is many things interpretation
The problem is that it has also continue to be preserved civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts serve for Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship has been in the military custody up to 11 000 civilians.
As stated in the proposal should be to protect 'of the true nature of the Egyptian families and support its morality and values'.
It is legally vaguely formulated in such a way that would help of this paragraph can state institutions even check the content of the film the arts and literature.
In a comprehensible speech, this does not mean nothing other than censorship.
Indeed, no paragraph in writing does not draw the explicit equality between men and women.
But another paragraph prohibits shaming or to defame of the Prophet Mohammed and its envoy.
However, remains unclear what is the defamation of religions and how it will be prosecuted.
Just as dubious causes of the wordings that it is prohibited 'insulting people'.
One need only in this case, already a caricature of a president or joke at the expense of the experts rights?
A matter of interpretation, as many further in this proposal, which Mursí will submit for signature and according to their words will be 'very soon' to present to the Egyptians for the purpose of the popular vote.
'The Revolution returned'
For several weeks, the shape of the opposition against the majority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people in an unusual of concord mustered on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and they promised to destroy the constitutional list, even before the entry into force.
'The Revolution come back and we will win,' said Hamdín Sabbáhí, which is in the presidential election has placed on the third.
The Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution 'to the dustbin of history.'
Through the services briefings Twitter accused supporters Mursího, that they want a 'coup against democracy'.
'If a referendum, we will go to his palace and svrhneme it said,' a Member of the opposition Yasser Said.
'We are tired of, the blood of our brethren is still not punished,' quote the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled, Ali.
A number of judges, announced that they do not want to keep an eye on the referendum, which would become neplatným.
'the Koran is our constitution'
Well organised the Muslim Brotherhood has declared vzdorodemonstraci, of the precautionary principle, however, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before káhirskou university.
There were many zahalených women and the supporters of the Salafis, who called: 'People's calls for the application of the law'.
Called Mursího: 'Vyčisti country!' and ubezpečovali: 'the Koran is our Constitution'.
The struggle for the sovereignty over a symbolic náměstím Square, on which it began, might trigger the state of a civil war.
This Mursího supporters quite obviously did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood has said that the opponents and advocates of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
It is now time to leave people at the ballot box to decide which direction is the country to go.
For some is considered by the majority in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
'The word' human rights', there is not even one '
Forced constitutional dispute, which should, in fact, to continue until February and to integrate all the social forces, ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa 'du.
Osmačtyřicetiletý human rights defenders and the President of the Egyptian the Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) advocated the members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood before the courts.
Not because they share their ideology, but because of human rights are indivisible.
For this was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
'A in the new constitution now are not the words' human rights' or 'one, complaining in an interview for' Welt Am Sonntag '.
Mursího the enlargement of the power to all three components of power in the state of the lawyer forced to resign.
These measures are scandalous crime against democratic rules of the game and Egypt will lead to new dictatorship.
'In place to the President of the civil society has strengthened, in fact it,' complaining Sa 'DA.
But without civil society organisations cannot democracy to function.
When 'DA feel abandoned and the international community, which is following the ideological factions for the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tensions.
This would he could easily backfire.
Protestor in Tahrir Square warning: 'you have created a monster, which have already you are unable to control'.
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most páchnoucí fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway indulges in one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
It could be secret of the success of the countries of the associated with the local apetitem for the extremely páchnoucí fish?
Take a few přezrálých of cheese.
It is put to the middle of dirty and wet football výstroje.
Let this week to lie.
So you will get a sense paralysing stench rakfisku, one of the greatest the Norwegian delikates.
I am in a small town Fagernes, roughly three hours since the Oslo.
There is the snow, a wonderful perspective - and in the air a pervasive stench.
Rakfisk is nasolený pstruh kvašený in the water for a maximum period of one year - depends on how much you want to fish páchla.
As stmívá and it is becoming the coldness are here in the Norwegians Fagernes meet the festival privy this, as to say that the best, nejpodmanivějšímu food.
This "dreaming raw and then zapijete full aquavitu, 'says Havard Halvarsen, local professional a fire-fighter, but also the so-called' Rakfisk General ', which is responsible for the festival.
All around us people are eating small bar of fish and with it is a huge amount of alcohol.
'Some people have a rather than rakfisk aquavit,' says Havard.
Can drink stench override them.
A few scraps of I will try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it is not so bad - this is a bit, sushi, which was in a long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a very different times, when it was in Norway poverty, and because there were a fridge, fish in the fall in namáčely vzduchotěsných casks with water and salt.
Then the middle of winter, when they were well zkvašené, vytáhly and snědly - senses undoubtedly blunt alcohol.
Only a generation have been thousands of Norwegians have achieved forced to leave their country and seek work, while the majority have emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants přilákaní a great deal of work, high earnings and large-scale care system.
The Swedish people, old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, are flowing into the country to work.
On the rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, albeit fairly stinking part of the Norwegian the past.
Among the more expensive meals on the market.
Even though expensive is all - a small a glass of beer or sendvič you will come to 9 of pounds ($14) for long.
Norway in worldwide reports often absent - and it seems that the majority of the population that suits.
The name of the right-wing extremists, Anders Breivik, racist, which in the last year, shot 77 men, women and children, people still only grudgingly.
Instead, the shooting called 'the event of 22 July'.
The Norwegians can only hard to believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway's wealth lies behind the current growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 of the twentieth century.
'But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,' says in the talířů with uleželým rakfiskem our dressed Anna, which, with its long hair blond and surprisingly blue eyes of our eyes is a prototype nordického well-being.
We, as you said, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English language of the majority of people, it is absolutely impeccable.
Nepředvádíme, do not like the pomp.
Norway deals with his oil wealth very cautiously - apart from a small percentage is the most money from this sector invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the other in the years leading to the global financial crash threw money, which should not, the Norwegians should šňůrky on its měšci firmly utažené.
'For as long as we can in the winter skiing and in the summer to go on trips, we are happy, "says the Anna.
'A to eat rakfisk,' gives with bezstarostným laughingly.
I stand in the snow in the queue to something to eat - rakfisku I have had enough.
Such a losí burger is certainly something else, and it is so beautifully šťavnatý.
But this evening is stinking fish, in turn, here.
The hotel, in which I live, is one of many jobs, which gives rakfisk to dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for smart the most demanding fish.
The combined with a TV transfer, in which is an interlocutor with motýlkem surrounded by plate with rakfiskem.
It is as pěvecká competition Eurovision.
'What score you for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?'
'Here is our bodování, Havarde'.
So, applause and laughter.
From the edge of a man, perhaps zmožený aquavitem.
Or perhaps the vapours and from all of those fish.
Enrique Pen Nieto from Mexico is a difficult start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pen Nieto preparing to taking office, looks, Will grant of the BBC to the challenges that face and the mixed the expectations of their fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently a particularly bad.
In the city, which is ucpané even in the best of times, were vztyčeny steel scruples closing a few key routes to the capital and causing on the roads of chaos.
Objective, however, was not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament.
On Saturday the new President of the Mexico Enrique Pen Nieto will receive a presidential šerpu and take over the leadership of the nation.
Face a daunting task.
Mexico at the time period of office of outgoing Felipe Calderona led well economically, the country is, however, in the grip of drug war that has already taken a victim of an estimated 60 000 lives in six years.
'My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in a reduction in violence,' said President Pen Nieto US President Barack Obama in Oválné working at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy, which will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before we potřásl hands with the US President, it has obtained President Pen Nieta political experience as Governor of their home state Mexico.
Views on the new leader are different and in its old back home, the country ’ s populous and the vast state surrounding the capital city.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town del Valle Bravo back to it in a good.
The citizens of him to the development of tourism in the summer resort villa and building infrastructure.
In the cities now you can arrive after one of the new highways, which left Pen Nieto to build motorways. These are a huge improvements compared to děravým and hrbolatým roads, which have been before.
Records with his on behalf of the also hangs in the wall of the modern sports centres and of an interactive museum of climate change.
'We expect that will bring real and lasting change,' says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera HERNANDEZ, state the Member for hand, the President Pen Nieta, institutionalised revolution Party (PRI).
We hope in a particularly interesting and the real changes in the area of security and the economy, that our country so urgently needs.
After the uninterrupted 81 years in power, the party is Vicente Fox the PRI.
Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years beyond the presidential palace Los Pinos within the Party from Enriqua Pen Nieta many expected.
And rejects the expression of the opposition that characterise the new President, as the man without substantial content.
This is very straightforward one, very biased with excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and mainly is the man who can to listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the state, which has the impression from its former Governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, cannot be the contrast with dlážděnými the streets del Valle Bravo more obvious.
Under the motorway Zastrčený nadjezdy in much sounds like the suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
And the problems in the Autonomous Community are also a sustained and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army, it was mobilised to help of managing the drug rings operating out in the neighbourhoods, particularly painful is violence against women.
Only in the last two years on pustých places in addition to the huge landfill waste pohozeny the bodies of dozens of the murdered women.
At a time when Pen Nieto governor, was murdered in the state of Mexico more than 1 000 women, which is much more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez - place, which is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, the critics Pen Nieta say that in his term in office, has failed in adequate tackle the problem of murders of women.
And, in the worst case scenario his leadership they accuse of escapism.
In betonovém House, a typical for zchátralou Quarter, me Irinea Buendia shows the photographs of their dead daughter Mariana Islands Luny and stifling the cries.
According to the official version, committed suicide Mariana in 2010.
Her family, however, believe that it murdered her partner.
'When I arrived in its home, so it seemed as if her body someone washed,' recalls Mrs Buendia.
There were signs of after strikes and has already started posmrtná rigidities.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, alongside the Cross, which is one word: 'Justice'.
However, this is, as the family, is exactly what they were refused.
The state authorities, to me to behave as if I was an old drbna, potížistka and kňouralka.
They want you to simply accept what they say, and were silent.
'But that cannot be right, when many errors and omissions,' says.
Šerpa, which President Pen Nieto on Saturday will receive is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected by the violent crime and the new President of the promised that, for his term in office will be a priority.
'I hope that will be the same President, as was governor,' says in the Valle del Bravo Member of the PRI Olvera.
However, this is exactly what the families of victims in Ciudad Neza are afraid of the most.

My crisis mexicko-americké identity
It says that many people have been forced to leave the Mexico from the lack of the possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those left; remind them of the difficult times, says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are lapeni between the two worlds.
In the last trip to the capital of Mexico I barely prodral the mob and arrived I am in the space for the agenda of immigrants, where I came across the problem.
Šipky showed to one of the two fronts: one for 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans') and the second for 'Extranjeros' ('aliens').
I stood there a few seconds and I did not know where I have to go.
I grew up in the middle of California, and the whole life, I was called the 'Mexičanem'.
This is an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston call 'the Irish' and my friends in New York ourselves referred to as' the Italians'.
So I later ended in the Mexican American '.
But this was Mexico.
And in my home děda was not necessary to use the acronyms.
I was simply an American.
I am speaking Spanish well enough to manage both sides of the interview in this language.
I am, however, the stock of rodilého speaker and I cannot rid of the US přízvuku.
So I am out their American passport and Front for the 'Extranjeros'.
I was thinking about the moment when this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pen Nieto President Obama visited in the White House.
On the agenda should the usual Affairs, which is a, when leaders meet these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pen Nieto I would also talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same chance that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as that they travel to the United States.
It wants to join with the United States and Canada and to create in North America trade bloc a similar the European Union.
And Pen Nieto promised that will continue in Mexico ’ s war against the drug cartels, although not provided any details.
For Mexico is the relationship with the United States of the complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never nepomyslela to the fact that in 1848, the United States had Mexico, and to force its leader under the threat of weapons rewrite half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who is thinking in the space of centuries, not minutes, are the comments of ubiquitous.
So a minute, after the United States will say something a little critical for Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican of the press and among the elite complaints that, as the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And children Montezumy moving on the path.
And yet it is for Mexico the real challenge to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the hostile feelings?
It is a lot.
In Mexico are winners and losers, the people, which offers the possibility of the country, and others, which not.
The only reason why so many people with the Mexican roots are living in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that, in a point of our family tree a person, perhaps parent or prarodič in Mexico, which was denied the opportunity and had to go to the North.
And, more often than it would appear, this person in line with the profile - tmavá skin, weak education, the origin of the poor villages, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are against them loyal.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we are now the American dream, go to the good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
And we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class us does not like.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and look at us as inferior race, which is not sufficiently Mexico ’ s.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is in their view, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico neselhaly, so it would never did not desert.
And we are now nenalézali imprisoned for Silk Curtain, with a good life in the United States, but also yet lost dušemi.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and in childhood legally přicestovala to the United States, reminds me of that, between the Mexicans and by the Mexican the Americans, because there is more Mexicans understand, and Mexican Americans who are not resent.
Even if it is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.
And, at the same time, many of the Mexican Americans, which I know, they do not feel as part of either.
Love poslech Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte region, but also Bruce Springsteena.
You will receive the best of both countries, but the roots of you have in either.
In Mexico to us are seen as the Americans.
And in the United States, we have seen as Mexicans.
And that relations even more complicated, they want some of the Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I heard again in its journey together with diasporou.
They want to Mexican the Americans have worked for Mexico as a 'provisional ambasadoři' and, Mexico ’ s interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and push for the political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No.
Therefore, this does happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And, thanks to the inequalities of revenue and a widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us is not certain that it is a great country.
I have a feeling that it is up to you, amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States, as discussed with Mexico before one and half a century ago, must accept the fact that some of the Mexican Americans still feel displeasure for the way in which was discussed with their family members in significantly closer to the past.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we have more 'Mexicans', before I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle East
The end of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas would even could be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can sometimes be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of the bloodshed, suggests that any such is happening is futile.
Between the usual unnecessary rumours about who began, there were many buildings changed in the rubble, killed more than 140 of the Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and the first time. The rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of Tel Aviv, the Israeli cities, and in the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But even if it appears that the Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in its ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East are changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and Israelis, whatever they like it or not, are engaged in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will mean that their struggle will be even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that it can to interrupt their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither vyhraná, or lost.
At first sight it seems that is not currently the many reasons to optimizmu.
Even if a cease-fire closed 21 November sustain the fight for this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that reigns in Gaza since 2007, to say that the Israelis will be forced to retreat, even if Gaza been defeated.
Despite the killing several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the planet, with Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another bit of Palestine, which is currently managed its are ardent rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian factions.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists throughout the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which was once the Muslim ally Israel, with the side of the Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic Crescent spans around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where there is a party / militias Hezbollah, Syria, where the rebels, who are still more inclined to islamizmu can remove Bashar al-Assad, and Jordan, where allies Hamas threaten the king.
And, above all, on the southern Israel ’ s end of the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood has changed under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and core of the Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, secular tyrant, which in Egypt ruled 30 years until his fall in 2011, not on Hamas time.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is bratrancem Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible public opinion.
In the future diplomacy can Hamas appear as a player who cannot be excluded or Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli hardliners to run out in the opposite of the conclusions.
In the military terminology was Hamas been put back into the boxes.
Israel ’ s anti-missile system of the Iron kopule proved its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
Israelis can better to sleep - at the moment.
In a diplomatic terminology, America is just as consistent pattern as always. Many European countries also vinilo Hamas from the opening of the last round of violence.
And, above all - Israel to prosper, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who ignored by the majority of the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004, was killed around 30 Israelis in Israel relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall, which is interfering in the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements, which is still growing despite its illegality before the international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose the Likud party at the start of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January teamed up with even more radical group led by Mr Lieberman, it is in good position.
Why coddle these treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If it really was ruled by in the West Bank, so would neodpalovali missiles, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better if we keep on the walls and praštíme is, when vystrčí heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will have won, but the Arab Spring can to change their calculations.
Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, not Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel ’ s defense spending are higher than spending all its four Arab neighbours together.
Opening of new war with local superpower hardly helps new Arab governments uzdravit its economy.
The fact that President Mursí worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, is a good sign, and can mean the beginning of something new.
Also the Israelis would be to the situation should look in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a denial of rights to the Palestinians to self-determination sud keg, which must one day in the areas of the occupied Israel explode - as well as the bus that last week exploded in Tel Aviv.
Already in the present time repression weaken in Jewish state of democracy and demography this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza konající every few years in order to drive Hamas will be still more to select the diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what we preach reasonable people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and these newspapers: two States, when Israel went territory for reasons of safety.
In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from outside of at least a little bit more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar must put a stop to the supply of arms into Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of the Jewish state, based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside must also press for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would for the creation of a Palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama has also on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In my first term overlooking the presentation of its own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, seems to be as reluctance in its entry into the process.
This is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia the entry into force of the laws on the terrible cigaretových packaging
On the nevzhledných green krabičkách, which are the same for all the signs of tobacco, are depicted warning for smokers and sick part of the body.
The entry into force of the Australian laws on the terrible packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, first of its kind in the world, and of the logo, colour brands have replaced the general olivově green krabičkami with ohavnými images of parts of the body and depiction of children and infanticide onemocnělých as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to the different health warnings and pictures are mandatory since Saturday the only difference between krabičkami the names of labels which are printed in the same in small print.
This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian the federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by a habit of its attraction.
Relying on the studies that show that if people do not smoke in the age of 26 years, is 99% chance that do not smoke never.
'I for very small children you can see that it understands the message that they tobacco companies are trying, together with their product to sell,' says the Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek and cites a study which, for example, have shown that children korunku logu link in with the idea to be princeznou.
While Australia is one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering the introduction of a similar steps.
The tobacco industry against the introduction of these laws lobbied hard.
Tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trade on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more accessible cigaretám.
'The this legislation will be a serious unintentionally consequences,' says Scott McIntyre from society British American Tobacco Australia recorded.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia taken much more of these products, which will be sold to the Australian the streets.
Another says that the laws of increased their business.
Sandra Ha from society Zico imports Pty Ltd, small family firms, said that the demand on the packaging of cigaretové silikonu serving to conceal the unsavoury krabiček, two months ago, when companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and the Japan Tobacco lost its appeals relating to the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company Zico sold almost 6 000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects new reserves.
It is for us a good trade.
As a possible the experts state popularity of social media, on the demographic groups to which the plan aims.
After a whole range of the Australian laws prohibiting the television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and demanding that the majority of dealers hid cigarettes from direct view, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia ban online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot be limited foreign websites.
'If you marketing worker in the tobacco industry you only this and there is little room for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be,' says Becky Freeman, research workers in the area of public health at the university in Sydney.
Mrs Freeman has recorded an increase in the evaluation of the labels on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the 'average Honzou'.
We must ask, it is just a private citizen who really loved cigarettes Marlboro and gave to the work and created the video, or that is involved marketing society?
Society British American Tobacco Australia recorded argue that the sector has focused on how to deal with the new regulations, than to marketing.
The sector has gone so far that has paid in Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack on the new legislation - the countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation, argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that no from countries with Australia significantly neobchoduje.
The Court decision SOO is expected in the middle of the year 2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has led the talks with other governments, which are thinking about such laws on the packaging.
Canada was the first country that in 2001 to introduce mandatory warning photographs.
Now extend to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are thinking about the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many of smokers in Australia is resisting.
The images of up to me they have no influence.
It is simply ignoruji.
'It is there and the child per pack strčíte back,' says Victor El Hage in the purchase of packs with photographs of a tumor in the mouth.
Frankly, it is only one reason for me to stop smoking, and this is my small dcerka.
James Yu that own trafiku King of the Pack in the heart of the Sydney, argue that, thanks to a single krabičkám is more difficult for it is up to the shelves.
'unloading me one hour, it took me now it takes four hours,' said Yu.
'The simply should completely banned, then we have said:, OK, this is the end, we close shop', 'said and rozhodil hands.
In the world of connections is not so bad be znuděný
The last Day díkuvzdání I am being spent five hours at the airport, when the plane should our mechanical difficulties and we have had to wait for the arrival of even further the aircraft.
So we have had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
You will not lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport to another years is irritating, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iPhonem (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on the development of the increasingly come with praise nudění.
They say that, for US (and our children) is good is sometimes be boring.
It has forced the brain to go to the interesting guidelines, which can to promote creativity.
And, given that most of us today is continually added to a screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the boredom.
We should therefore ennui to support?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to this.
Firstly, as well as many people I assumed that nuda is relatively new phenomenon, which happened with the arrival of the more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of the Greek and Roman the history of the Canadian University in Calgary, which is the author of the books Boredom: and Lively History (History boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
'In fact, has nuda a long history,' said.
On the walls of Pompejích was found in the Latin saying on boredom, coming from the first century AD.
And then it is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that have been defined and discussed many different ways, John D. Eastwood said, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontariu in Canada.
After a research literature and bringing the idea of the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define the boredom as experience 'I wanted to do something that I am satisfied, but I was not capable of'.
Nuda apathy different from that person is not involved in nothing, but I would be.
He says that there is no urge to do something for apathy.
It says that at the heart of boredom is' the disruption of the process of attention, combined with bad mood and a sense of slowly ubíhajícího time '.
Nuda can a lot of the depression.
But a professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a mutual relationship, have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while the people who are in a depression, see the problem alone in itself.
Sometimes we think we are bored, I am going to when we only have difficulties with.
In its study 'The Unengaged Mind: Boredom in Defining Terms of attention', which was in September, published in the Perspectives he Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed out earlier experiment, in which the participants have listened to the ribbon that person read an article from.
Some groups heard loud and television programme in the room, others it heard so quietly, it barely noticed that, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who television programme heard silent, hlásili boredom, more than the other two groups - have difficulties with, but were not sure why and giving these difficulties boredom.
When you are trying to focus on the difficult or exciting task, can lead to distortions of boredom, said Mark J. Fenske neuroscience, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontariu and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are doing something nudného, as it is the search for a bad components on factory line, can help with the distraction of music to nenudili '.
In fact, he said, we now know that shaking and čmárání, which are often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with the use to fight and to keep people physically attentive.
'Research shows that children, which is allowed to wag, the more they learn and keep more information than those that are forced to sit in the calm,' said Professor Fenske.
We have all experienced - sometimes ennui my flight delays, hučící reproduktor, particularly the lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance to be boring than others.
For assistance with measurement of boredom scientists in the 1980 ’ s developed 'scale for susceptibility to nudění' (Boredom Proneness SCALE).
The scale includes issues such as: 'For many things that I have to do is repeated and is monotónních,' and 'I have many interests, that I do not have the time it is all to do'.
Through these scales scientists have found that boys tend to be boring, more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich said, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulus.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and social development of the University of Illinois, by the experiment, in which the seven to eight times a day contacted the almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
Found that 32% of young teenage said nudili in school and in doing domestic tasks, while 23% said nudili, if they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents have said that nudili.
Professor Larson said that they do not know whether the percentage of boredom has now been, 21 years later, more or less.
But, said that he knows that the 'maturation is the time for the boredom', which is largely due to the fact that the children and young people is not made much control of what they want to do.
So back to my original question: 'It is for you nuda good?'.
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, played a gambling or abused addictive substances as a way as to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers the discussion on the link between the use and creativity, Professor Vodanovich said that the problem has studied for more than two decades.
'nuda is the way the brain, as you say that you should do something else,' said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain does not always the best thing that you should do.
If the nudíte and use this energy to gambling on kytaru and cooking, you will do this.
However, if you will watch television, do you not pleased at the moment, not only in the long term.
So, if your child nudí and you will give him iPad, it will not be boring, but nenaučí, as is itself to take or separately, Professor Fenske said.
And the 'this independent governance is being transferred from one of the situation on the other,' said Professor.
Your child does not learn how only as itself, but will be greater self-restraint in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of it.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable, when we have from the reach of constant drnčení activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
'we are accusing it of the need to be boring is even more, but nuda is painful, restless, the desire to be associated with something meaningful,' said.
What in fact, people are looking for, say, is the way is to mobilise and see and enjoy during leisure time.
'In the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní,' said, 'it is difficult to find ways to commandeer, when the noise vypne'.
In Colorado there is no a handbook on the new law on marihuaně
Devatenáctiletý, Anthony Orozco, student at higher professional school and player from south-east Colorada, face charges of the offences for something which will soon be in the state of legal - for the possession of a few grams of cannabis and dýmky, which used to its smoking.
Mr Orozco said that a September day went with few mates in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansasem, when he was stopped.
After a policeman found in a car smoked cannabis, it was Mr Orozco issued subpoenas for possession of drugs and equipment to the use of drugs - minor offences, for which it is for every $100 a fine - and he was set a date of the Court.
'behave to us as to criminals,' said Mr Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In precarious weeks after coloradském the vote on the legalisation of small quantities of cannibas for recreational use of the answer depends hundreds of minor drug rather than on the law on the ground.
Hundreds of cases of offences for the possession of cannabis has already been here and in Washington State, which was approved by a similar measures.
Police separation to stop blaming adults in the age of 21 years and the elderly in possession of a small amount of which will be legally authorised after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.
But the prosecutors in konzervativnějších districts Colorada said that will continue with the existing cases concerning cannabis, and still blame for the possession of people.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs Denveru towards the Western horám is voting to prevent the opening of new, state licencovaných deals with marihuanou in their communities.
'This issue develops so quickly that I do not know what will happen next,' said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, East of Denveru.
The Heads of the drbou and regulators in Washington State.
And look for guidance as to set the system of licences for growing, production, distribution and sale of - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, Colorado, whether in a good or for worse, it is more advanced than the majority of the States in the regulation of cannabis, firstly for medical use, and now and recreational.
'Colorado has more regulated market, and so will be a good guide,' said Brian E. Smith, the spokesman for the Council for licensing the sale of alcohol state Washington.
But, as Mr Smith recognized no place or system cannot do more than to propose, what might work.
'There is no real precedent, according to which we could manage,', he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, is to take effect on 6 December, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which will still not be a national licensing system, but legal holding yes.
And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to balance the law on 'appropriate' approach to a licensed marihuaně with its ban on trade with konopím to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's fields or child centres.
'Nowhere will not be more difficult to locate licencovaný trade with konopím than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,' said Ben Livingston, the Speaker of the Centre for legal cannabis, recently based research group.
On 21 November sent police chief Oates from the city Aurora its officers an e-mail in which they have already announced that urban Prosecutor will not prosecute offences for the possession of a small amount of cannabis for every citizen of the older 21 years and that the police 'with immediate effect' stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will promote the urban laws regulating growers medical marijuana, and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In County Weld in northern Colorado represents a district prosecutor, Ken Buck stricter view.
After the vote, that his Office will continue to prosecute cases possession of cannabis, the majority as a way to press for users, to seek treatment.
Currently face charges of the possession of 56 grams or less cannabis 119 people, even if many of them are facing further accusations.
'Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences, which was crimes in a time when they occurred,' said Mr Buck in your statement.
The response was complicated even in places such as rural district Mesa, where the voters rejected marihuanovou initiative.
The police in the Grand Junction, the largest city district, already adults blame for the possession of a small amount of.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to her possession of all the ongoing cases.
'I do not think that the lost their time continuing in the law enforcement, as long as it does not change,' said.
While 55% of the plains of voters supported measures, bringing the recreational cannabis into the arms of the government and legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory responses across state revealed with regard to the large state green experiment deep division between local officials.
For the district prosecutors this is the 'cultural barriers', he said, Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denveru, which represents the accused of the possession of cannabis, and local the spokesman for the National Organisation for the reform of the laws on cannabis.
'spend so much of his life to the persecution of people that they still do not really to accept that it is legal,' said.
As the first States, which is to a small amount of cannabis are as to alcohol, Colorado and Washington on track to national testovacími cases to legalise drugs.
Advocates and national authorities are planning a new border for regularised the sale and, at the same time, scrupulously waiting instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and the cultivation of cannibas for federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of cannabis hope that the justice complies.
Despite several arrests clerks of cannibas for medical purposes and patients who use, which have attracted the attention, allowed the majority of the federal government, business with the medical marihuanou in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 States in operation.
While protidrogoví agents will probably not forcing the door to since none have been picked up a little poke of with the drug, it is likely that the state ’ s allowing regulated deals with recreational marihuanou permitted new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former advisor in counter-narcotics policy administration of President Obama.
A few plains of cities it is not waiting for the procedure of the federal authorities.
Even before the election day some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marihuanou, even though it will take even about a year before it can any trade open.
Last week, the city Montrose in the west of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.
'We do not want to be in a situation where someone we spend the licence and then for this we have the large federal issue,' said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the City Council.
Our Community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at it, what they voted for Community, compared to what has become.
There is indeed many questions.
Wyatt Petronella: 'I was forced to leave Oxford, because I am a Conservative'.
For their views are not being attacked only today's university students.
I, that I sometimes nesnila to study at university in the Oxford.
As my father, so my older brother have studied at the University, which I thought that is the world's largest the seat of knowledge, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilisation, freedom of thought and tolerance.
And I have not yet at the end of the 1980s in two weeks after coming to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, sbalila bags and vřítila I have in the first of the scandal of his life.

Yes, utekla I am, because I was the subject of the systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of their somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I come from the private schools.
I have been persecuted for the sole reason, and in the cradle of the alleged Enlightenment this was how bigotní and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a senior advisor Margaret Thatcher and I am a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why this vytahuji up to now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students on the right from the centre of suffering from this kind of persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred against the conservative students at Oxford, is so great that, last week, the Group of these students claimed the same protection of equal rights as gay, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative Members of the younger years (JCR) on the corpus Christi College say that because of their political views are 'often exposed to actively isolated, personal attacks and is made clear that are not welcome the'.
They are asking for the creation of a position in the university Committee for equal opportunities, which would ensure that their views can communicate freely.

Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.
It is for me this is bad enough, but they know that yours father is close to the Margaret Thatcher, so for you this will be even worse.
Most conservative prváků pretends that are labouristi.
Later in the local pub I have tried to pretend lily-livered.

The toughest trade in the world: nosiči sulphur in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen
For four of the euro gamble nosiči in the area of the volcano with his life and health, when they endure 70 kilogram of sulphur down the steep brick-and-mortar stezkách.
People are, for which it is their work hell, and are some who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living conquering the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Jáva.
This must every day fárat up to the bottom kráteru, where escape sirné gases from vnitřku the earth and in contact with the air of turning into a solid state.
After vyseká large blocs of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 kilo, affecting the is on the shoulders in two bambusových baskets after the steep brick-and-mortar stezkách.
On top of the volcano which tower 2 386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but vyčerpaným nosičům has lasted for over 40 minutes to drift the pace of a tortoise up because they maintain the balance and thoroughly rozvažují their action to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.
They know that any klopýtnutí could become a life, as it has one of the French turistce years ago, which fell from skal Kawah Ijen.
Miners Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which are extracted
When they are up, leading the way around tourists who is fotografují as monkeys the circus and tired odnášejí difficult basket of the weight that mining company has put a bit further, in altitudes 1850 metres.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in a live volcano benefit from 1960 and never their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents per kilo of sulphur.)
It is then sold at 10 000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this nerost has its place in the everyday life and is used for the production of matches, entertaining pyrotechniky dynamitu, cosmetics, and even in the approach of sugar.
'As is routinely wear 70 kilo, first, around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for any way' explains Anto us, which normally taking three avenues on a daily basis.
One way it takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but can thus make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) for the day.
Although it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what would be made in the field.
'daily wage miners there is a very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is 15 000 rupees (EUR 1.2) for the day and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (EUR 167),' explains nosič, which previously worked on the tourism the island of Bali as zedník.
There was his salary 75 000 rupees (EUR 6.2) for the day and work has been so hard, but Anto returned to their family to Banyuwangi, village near the eruption of the serious reason, which is in Indonesia as strong as síra: 'oženil I have with the young dívkou of the Bali, which is Hindu, and I have taken it to Jávu that converted to Islam'.
Anto has asthma, poorly it breathes, still does not and eyes has fractious toxic gases
In its 27 years Anto three times a day is risking life in a live volcano Kawah Ijen, whose síra, it has already begun to collect their tax, even though it faces protected special the guise of and spectacles.
It has asthma, poorly it breathes, still does not and eyes has fractious toxic gases which are disappearing from volcanoes.
This is the price that must pay for it to get his dream.
'I will work even two years, because I want to open up trade or study Spanish or French,' promises more than the American-educated Karadzic raged.
This fine and intelligent man stižený fate could be tourist guide, číšníkem or recepčním in a hotel, and instead, it is doing the work of the carrier.
Shares the dirty wooden chatrč with other nosiči wakes up and every day in the two hours in the morning, because síra in the night continues to build up and its characterised by yellow paint is changing in the blue and September rather.
Despite the rest of light fárá Anto into kráteru and highlights the way a small svítilnou, which has připevněnou on helmě and myself it as their money to buy.
About 400 of recorded media yields on the shoulders of the sírou from the trough kráteru
Although the company has its high incomes, the extraction of sulphur because of the cost savings nezmechanizovala, nor does not provide nosičům workers on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, do not receive the share of the 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the surcharge applied for the photographing, which, together with a passport for 15 000 rupees (EUR 1.2) collect hlídači natural fleet from tourists who come to took photos of the volcano and its human muly.
'This work is for livestock, and not for the people' notes Madrusin, a 42-year old statný nosič who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since left school.
 Manage uzvednout when 110 kilo and assures us that will continue to work ', as long as they can', because needs money on the education of its three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I will not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano was my entire life
Although síra burns throat and štípe in the eyes, when the wind and unexpectedly turn polapí the miners in dense výparech that of the volcano are based, miners are so says that no one of them nestěžuje that suffers from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems artrózy, pain its knees and on the shoulders of the wounds caused by weight baskets.
Unainik, which balances its basket on the back, in their own 53 years can do it only 50 kilogram of.
Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in a live volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three lorries odvážejí a sharp a path between houštím in storage in Tamansari distant 18 kilometres.
'I will not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano was my entire life,' States Unainik and opens up while broadly lips, in which there is a lack of a few teeth.
From his five sons, the oldest, a 30-year, also makes dolováním of sulphur.
Time is passing, but the continuing misery one of the most difficult of crafts in the world remains from generation to generation - crafts, which perform human muly in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore shání old order to save the economy
Singapurci enticing that do not have children for a career, stress and the cost of living and education.
'Obyvatelstvo Singapore needs growth'.
I am married and I am patriot, those you my wife and you vlastenka. Carry out our its civil duty and zploďme a new life!
It may seem an incredible that, this slogan is part of advertising on mentolové sweets, but yet - or perhaps that is why - the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These are part of the sentence rapu, which uses the local allusions type of 'we will give buchtu into the ovens' as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising agency BBH that video created, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem of this advertising vtipným way.
Artistic the Director of Douglas Hamilton says that I use the influence of music for people to meet the 'civic duty'.
'This is merely a matter of the Internet, so it had to be amusing and funny.
This is the biggest problem with this country.
We have the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which need to touch on.
We knew that the government attempted to a lot of things like to extend perfume with feromony or organise meet-up parties.
Many of these ideas could be a creative, but not entirely operational.
So we thought, why do the most creative possible thing, as is the composition of rapu, in order to resolve this problem. "
1.2 children
Anyone who does not take the power of lightly, is the government of Singapore.
Spends USD 1 300 per year to encourage citizens to have more children.
Government package for marriage and family provides up to 15 000 dollars on the child, extending maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures should but little effect.
Singapore is rich city state with advanced technologies in the South-East Asia, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 of children per woman.
Most recently exceeded fertility rates the value of 2, which is regarded as the rate of recovery plan, in 1976.
Why, in fact, Singapurci do not have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, the Department of marriage and family of the National Authority for the population is that this is because of the 'better education' and 'to a wider range of career opportunities'.
The 'People have available a wider range of possibilities in terms of the objectives and priorities, it is not only the marriage and family,' explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of free people and to postpone marriage and bring children into existence. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While in the framework of the immigration policy existed efforts drastically increasing the flow of immigrants as measures against the population decline, between the local population that has given rise to resentment.
On some of the Singapore website is to see the overt xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integration.
Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year has seen the government party Singapore its worst election result from the beginning of independence.
After the election was trying to tackle the problem with the help of the quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unforeseeable consequences.
The government is seeking to nestavělo as many small home.
For example, has begun to influence the trade in real estate.
The Office for urban development started to regulate the number of small housing censuses known as' box from the shoes', which can build in certain urban areas.
These flats have the area of 46 metres Square and have a great success in prodejnosti.
However, there is concern that these flats can encourage mládenecký lifestyle and deter developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, the CEO developerské firms EL Developers, arguing that their 'box' from the shoes sold far faster than more houses.
'There are popular, and so that are sold on the days and weeks faster than the houses with greater area.
That is why they are for our money flow of a much better '.
However, recognises that the new standards for a clearer rules Developers, who were previously restrained, when they wanted to offer too many small, in one of the project.
Too become stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although this new rules could seek to increase the birth rate of the nation, conversation with Singapurci workers in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will have a great effect.
'The people are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, because it postpones the many people, "says the young officer.
'Other whether they have children.
But it is important to me to rely on their own money and time, 'says another, perhaps, a 20-year-old man.
Men and women are mentioned career, stress and the cost of living and education as the reasons that prevents them from to have children.
So, whether the government is trying to force the citizens of any to have children, they are all ultimately Singapurci who are on the creation of a family the last word.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the vocabulary of the Royal vydávaného Spanish academies it is something that has a personal nature or 'area of private life, which everyone is the right to protect against any distortion of the'.
What is this privacy for people under 16 years?
As this definition applied in their daily lives and on social networks?
Understands the danger, which is subject to, when on the Internet are matters that would certainly no one in the normal communication say?
Journalists from elPeriódico vyzpovídali five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are often Internet users.
In four cases saw the concept of privacy for 'something quite own' in a personal level, and for the 'user name and the motto of', if it were a social networks.
'My the greatest secrecy like been kept secret,' says the 10-year Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Windows Hotmail and Live Messenger, which accounts for two years.
'It is very secret secrecy, my máma on them can know, but not the whole world, "says.
'The FB I give a nice fotky or fotky, as we are playing.
Also there Povídám to the famous.
I did not share own photo, which would not be my, or own photo, which would someone zesměšnila, 'says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish the obscene photographs, photographs of persons or white photographs of naked images of crimes, or write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says that he knows all the 35 friends, that it has on FB and their supporters of the nine on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
It is between them and a mother, which has a name and the motto of one of the accounts.
'I have established the bill on Twitter, to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I do not know whether someone me an answer, I, too, there is only so I give, 'supplements.
'The social networks are amusing, I can speak with relatives, who are far or quickly to communicate with friends,' says.
Without hesitation says that would never accept a request from unknown people.
Nor would it was interested not be recommended if someone unknown.
The case of čtrnáctiletého José is different.
This teenager own accounts on networks Hotmail, Facebook, We Space and ask and in the last of these networks admits that knows no 20 people from its list of friends.
'I do not have this fear, because we have something in common, for example, the music,' povídá.
According to this boy no one of them to nothing nenaváděl, even after it would not address or telephone number.
'If I have urged or it from me, it is simply from its account odstraním,'.
José asked to ask, having read the recommendations on Twitter.
The boys are not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
'known a friend to the social network of blackmail.
Threatened him and asked the money.
Never nedověděl, who was, 'confirms.
The victim, José neodhlásila of account.
'Jenom to activate the private regime'.
Then, explains a series of steps, as safely to set up the tab.
Unlike Jorgeho would this boy published fotky known in the uncomfortable or trapných situations.
'Jasně that should like to do that, if anyone vadil or should I simply wanted.
Although I know that this is cyberbullying, "says.
The key issues
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and absolventka the field of education and teaching, considers that children and adolescents in the social networks rightly put, must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
It states that: 'The Internet has emerged as a means for the search for information, but when there were social networks, has changed the rules of the game'.
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky graduate pedagogiky at Yale University, and the author of Article Digital natives and the digital immigrants, introduce these terms, to explain this phenomenon.
'Digital natives are children and young people who were born in a time of this technology.
We have the digital immigrants, who is we need to learn, and yet they only learn, 'says.
Explains that it is a difficult subject, 'because we ask them to rozeznávali what is appropriate to spread, and to say, and on the contrary, what not, in an age when to this are not yet zralí'.
Also, to be - as regards the environment - rozvážní, at a time when what is most eager to be oblíbení, have thousands of friends and think about the consequences of the 'gives.
According to this specialistky is the most effective way, as children and dospívajícím to show what it is of privacy, put questions, which is forcing to think.
'To say to them, are doing something, is not working,' gives.
Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that you would not choose stranger nevyprávěl, so why this děláš on the Internet?
Or this: we would have those if someone published tvou own photo, as you are those published kamarádovu?
As you know, on the other publish?
When označuješ fotkách of persons at the celebrations, you asked for permission from these people?
And even one: the need to constantly all know what has just děláš?
Another point is, to realise that we must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
'Putting people outside the Internet by respect, morals and other principles and the same this should be on social networks, "says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, a teacher at first instance, and educational adviser explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of the social networks.
'If understand každičké záludnosti, they have a good basis for the children were saying about the consequences that the establishment of the bill on the Internet can have.
For example, with regard to the age or what is allowed to share or to publish, 'says.
 Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remember the children of the traditional rule 'nemluv to strangers'.

'I have spoken with him, since it is on our embassies, but Ambassador informed me that a small pulmonary difficulties, but no serious,' said the Ecuadorean the head of state.
'The but that its physical and psychological situation deteriorates, because it is closed on a small area without the possibility of movement for fresh air.
This would mark the health of each, ".
President Correa pointed out that the solutions provided Assange asylum since June in Quito, Embassy in London on the basis of permits, which allows him to travel into Ecuador, it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, and stress that, with the London were held talks in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks.
'We nevyjednáváme on human rights, such word in this case, but not always have the talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón is a series of management for the various European ones' mentioned.
He said that 'if the United Kingdom will tomorrow propustku, all this will end the'.
And if Sweden will listen to Mr Assangeho in Quito, Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows without the problem of the legislation and as has already been done in other cases, will tomorrow this problem has been the end of the '.
Correa take this situation to be presented as a defender of the press freedom, and make it clear that, certainly does not tolerate 'podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermine freedom of expression'.
The greatest enemies of a free press, not us podlí and perverts politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, 'said.
From this perspective, express my delight at the fact that neither takovíto journalists, "or the bankers, nor the hegemonic country, nor do not speak of the bourgeoisie Ecuador ', and the anticipated that, if re-elected,' will continue in the changes brought the right way and in the right direction '.
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto expressed Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur at least in its the next elections and argued that a whole 'must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus riddle wrapped in legality' because, in fact, 'destroy legitimacy paraguayské democracy'.

At the moment is the judgment of the accepted.
'This is a problem between South American and the Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome will go along.
We need is to examine broadly, to be overcome and was able to go forward. '
I also express the hope of in settling the dispute on the maritime borders, which deals with in the same court Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that 'it is for Latin America right to seek international resort, if the two countries commit themselves to adopt a judgment, whatever however tough'.
In connection with the possibility that would stand in the next presidential election in Ecuador to ucházel in the order of the third mandate, noted that the possibility of 'with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes difficult'.
Correa said that, if in February 2013 loses the elections, will leave the public life.
'I am personally never nezajímala power, but so unfair situation, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can remedy the only political power.
My political movements believed that I who guarantees that likely victory, so this responsibility we need to adopt, 'said.
'If prevailed, this would be my last presidential term and I will then of the policy left.
When we will lose, awaits me the same.
I have already decided, 'said.
Correa also mention the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.

AIDS victims today are the result of the late diagnosis
Fabriziovi 21 years, when he was confirmed by the outcome of his test: HIV positive.
'It was, I would like to put his wildfire' tells in memories at the moment of truth, which was' a bit of a doctor to reduce the ', but obviously without success.
The boy this before the family concealed.
Decided to take their illness itself on their shoulders and start of information. And with such commitment that has already celebrated its 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of Units nejdávnějších HIV patients in hospital in Guadalajara Justice (HCG), which came in 1994 after several fighting with the disease.
Fabrizio live with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990 ’ s, when there were a lot of doubt, the little treatment options and the greater the stigma.
Then it is neither the director of the clinics of the Institute of social security (IMSS) nerozloučil ', because had řeznou blow'.
Then have the AIDS has been synonymous with the death penalty.
Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and fully to live.
However, it is a lot of people who do not know about their illness and come when the virus caused devastation organism and vysílil immune system, and then the victims of random infections.
31 years since the world have AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, 'means a great success that life expectancy of the patient, timely and appropriate manner will begin with the treatment, is exactly the same as for the healthy people said', Jaime Andrade Villanueva, the Civic Units HIV in the hospital in Guadalajara, with the fact that this information has been confirmed in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and specialist of HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that, since 2008 AIDS is not the judgment of the penalty, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability the immune system of patients, which is a disease diagnosed with better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 cells CD4 can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells CD4 up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that those who are HIV are diagnosed in 25 years, can these findings', with respect for the treatment to live without the problems of up to 75 years', he explained in an interview a doctor.
To highlight this progress is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died on AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 the 862 in 2011 (ročenka the Joint Programme for HIV / AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS killed in national statistics 60% of patients.
In the state Jalisco died in 2011 255 of people and in May of this year, so far, 187. However, since 2005 is a universal access to antiretrovirotikům.
 - Why continue to people die on the consequences of the disease?
 - 'It seems to me that the problem is not in the opportunities for access to treatment.
This is the way I see that this is happening with us in the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not run out of the medical supplies. The problem is that patients are in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the situation of the infection, or in the late stage of the disease. "
It adds convincing figure: '9 of the ten patients, when it comes to show some into the infection. The only what is needed, so that we can do more to influence the overall mortality, is a disease previously diagnose, and it is therefore to be in a large scale to offer tests on the findings of the disease to all persons, which may request them'.
In its proposal corresponds to the specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state Jalisco and directly to patients as Fabrizio, which came to do tests in the private laboratories, simply because he has done his friend, and despite its low age for it already erupted AIDS and also suffered from Kaposiho sarkomem, cancer, which is one of the usual complications.
'It will change, when you know that you have the AIDS.
Some think that nothing further umřou, and do not want to know.
'If I have to die, rather the three times a week vyřádím, "they say, but this is not my case.
The change was for the better, a healthy, cvičím, I take medicines'.
To date, his parents knows only that suffered from cancer.
'Žiju a normal life as anyone.
I am working, I have a lot of activities, I am travelling, have been active sex life, but responsibly, I watch out for themselves and on the other person 'lists Fabrizio, which adopted a challenge to share their experience with daily MILENIO JALISCO that today, within the World AIDS Day sending their testimony those who are afraid.
'The tests whether they do. The risk, so be it knows as soon as possible, whether they are HIV positive, it is better, and whether they were diagnostikováni, whether they realise that they can live as anyone else, when will be responsible'.
This sums up his message to the motto of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
The end of condoms
Between programmes for the health and the ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Salazar, Ricardo guadalajarský journalist, which reveal information about the HIV virus.
And the largest gaps are in the prevention.
In places that this task to the 'is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before us give one or two, today give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who have on condoms approach', said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to new infections are adolescents.
'The what you want?' is a question of irony and assessing the social workers, school advisers, employees pharmacies and medical staff, which the teenage want to avoid, says reporter for.
This proposed ineffective the distribution of condoms. Whatever change are not just for the shelves, but those 100 whether it is in dávkovačích on public záchodcích, in places where often go young.
'It is not support promiskuity.
Or it is not about them 'pay and beer motel', as has responded Governor Emilio González on the question of whether he agrees with the allocation of prezervativů in my region.
It is not Takovásexualita. The best is to make use of condoms those who have sex life are leading, 'said.
The key figures in the state Jalisco
There was 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 of cases of HIV).
This situation means in Mexico fourth place in the new and detected cases of AIDS and 13 place in connection with HIV.
92% of the spread of a sexual way, 6% blood way y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that, with the HIV virus can live about 50 000 people, because on the one registrovaný case is the four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment passed a court of appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring companies Grupo vitro konkurzem laid down in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national business with branches in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
So, it seems that the procedures the restructuring of companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country pruhů and stars in spite of international agreements is not true.
Approval of the judgment issued by 15 June last year judge Harlinem Hal for bankruptcy Court for the north of the Texas leaves in practice sized firms without defence against the possibility of the confiscation of their assets on the other side of the River Bravo.
However, the judgment of the Mexican producers glass opens the door to the Supreme Court by the United States with an appeal against the three irregularities.
First of all is to be said that, while the judge this cause argue that creditors have to manage the insolvency law of the United States, the appeal court ’ s Fifth district in New Orleans says that the procedure provides for bankruptcy in Mexico.
Firstly, it would indicate ignorance of international procedural cooperation in the cases of insolvency of the multinationals.
In fact, was for this purpose, created a model of the law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which determines the organisation of the American arbiter of Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling states that without a vote of branches of the internal business structures, as is recognised the debt of the parent company vitro against pobočkám, would not be reached the required majority to the approval of restructuring.
However, this possibility of the Mexican the laws of the population.
The fact is that the case of society vitro was not the first, in which was adopted by this scheme.
There is half a dozen examples as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which their inter-company debts ručil Federal bankruptcy of Technology.
In addition, it is true that even after votes branches creditors - who against society vitro stood in court in the United States, i.e. the funds' supů ', such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - not achieved the majority.
In the vote would achieve about 45% to 37.
This figure does not take into account the Court of Cassation.
From a different angle blame the Court society vitro from the difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of serious economic crisis, which has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm González set of will appeal for a new assessment directly in the appeal court to the assessment took place for the full participation in the participation of the five judges, as originally vote only three.
Failing here will demand as a remedy the revision of the process of higher ones in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case, it is important that the Court has document being sent by the Mexican Government as by an amicus curiae in which it is described in detail the procedure society vitro in the bankruptcy of law and which points out that society facilitate by adhered to the agreements signed the two countries to the law, confronted with Chapter 15 insolvenčního the law of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country complies with the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for international trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for the debtors and creditors.
Crash on both sides: the death for society vitro and the state.

Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes: 'basketball was my life'
Basketbalový světoběžník Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes was with this sálovým sport linked more than 60 years and procestoval thanks to him the whole world.
Few people in Portoriku has such a number of memories of the history of the local basketball, as has Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes.
Reyes, before it was in 2008 has attracted brain stroke on kolečkové seat, an ardent supporter of the sport after more than 60 years, whether as a player under the age of categories player National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the National Basketball League, or President Portorické Basketball Federation.
'I held in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, as when I was in the 1990 ’ s President, the National League BSN jednatelem national team and the President of the Federation,' Reyes recalled during the visit reporters newspapers Primera Montenegro at home in Bayamónu, where they live for more than 50 years with Isabel, its true his wife.
'compete' was my life.
In his assertion Reyes not.
The wall of his home, which are almost all zdobeny fotkami and upomínkovými objects of its long career witness to this.
Bayamón at the heart of
With the greatest emotion of all the guard those which are reminiscent of the results of his Vaqueros since the 1950s, where a player in 1982, when the same time, celebrated 15 years as spolumajitel or the owner of a team.
'That was is best for years, that I am most used, because I had the opportunity to the team toss Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight World Cup, either as the owner, spolumajitel, or coach.
This was a number of years of success, including five šampionátů held in the years since 1971 to 1975.
And then I have one šampionátem farewell - in 1981, when in BSN debutoval Jerome Mincy.
Then took the team 'Cuco' Ortiz, which was an excellent leader said, 'Reyes.
'I am reminded that Gene Bartow, which has been said before, and the time spent on Alabamské University in Birmingham, told me:' I have for you urostlého dvoumetrového player.
You want it? '
And it was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players, which when Portoriko should.
I recommend Bartow after rozehrávače Raymond Gausseho, which has become a Member of the team and one of our best marksmen.
I remember that said, that if Mincy will bring Bayamonu victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to further. '
When, for its team toss Vaqueros played Gausse, we made, but at a distance, because in 1988 already perform the office of President Basketball Federation.
At that time to the full pay their roles and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
'I am reminded, as the first time, we have defeated the United States in kvalifikačním Olympic struggle in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we have ended up neighborhoods, but we should have the bronze without that the Canadian the referee, which allowed us to repeat the final vhazování, 'said Reyes.
It is a team of the World Cup in 1990, the best national team, which you have ever seen?
It is between the best, as well as the one who defeated Dream Team there are, in fact, in 2004.
But my favorite was national team in Panamerických Games in Cuba 1991, when we won gold and throw we have a team of the United States, which was quite similar to that vyfouklo bronze us to the World Cup.
This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and 'Piculína' (Ortiz), but there were also became (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, which could not be in the team in 1990 to injury kolene.
A team that might not perfect, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring about a great joy, was a team of the Olympic qualifications in 1995 in Argentina Neuquénu.
With the players on the oh, such as' Canito 'Nieves, and Pablo Alicea juniorský player Rolando Hourruitiner who replace player excluded because of potyčce in Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions we won gold.
What was the best actor Portorika?
This was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His the figures from the international turnajů are impressive.
No one from Portorika has not been achieved at this level of such as Piculín.
Not to mention its involvement in the various ligách, where play.
Who was the best portorickým said?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes, Julio Toro Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
From the young, I very much like the work of Leo Arilla.
That its success in a federation do you consider the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of national teams in 1988 to 1995 and that the early 1990 ’ s National League should BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What you have failed to do?
Are things that I wanted to introduce, as the distribution of youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that little boys receive from Ponce play only in their region and the rivals with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-off.
Now the children of a lot of travel and play a too matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the mandatory certificate and rates for coaches, assistants rozhodčích and arbitration.
I am pleased about that.
What it is now to?
The most I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos of music from my time, where I enjoy the grandchildren and sometimes chodím on Basketball struggles.
And, of course, I society their wives Isabel, which was always after my side.

Starting rate, which examines the 'the end of the world'
Every week students studying the Beast of the issues such as nuclear war, of zombies, viruses, bacteria and global warming.
When Professor religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester will do the course of the end of the world, knew that this is irresistible the enticement ': the end of a number of' Mayského calendar, which is to come on 21 December, the chytlo many people as proof that the end of the world comes.
Charmé, however, had no idea what it is in the next few months: the disastrous hurricane Sandy, budgetary gap, which some call the 'debt Armageddon was still firmly', and growing conflict, which is zatažen Israel, where according to the Christians teoretizujících about the end of the world starts Apocalypse Now.
'I did not realise that this will be nejapokalyptičtější Semester, what was said,' Charmé this week students Rutgersovy Camdenu in the University of New Jersey.
When one and abstractly what is happening today in the world, as if the time of 30 days, this really is a good time.
And remember that the wrong means for apokalypticky minded good.
And this is not the only professor, which offers rates on the 'the end of the world' in this semester, which in theory is the last in history.
At the University Temple holds professional assistant, Barry Vacker rate 'Money, culture and the end of the world'.
Every week students studying the Beast of the issues such as nuclear war, of zombies, viruses, bacteria and global warming.

This month, analysing the students films with apocalyptic issues and looking into how it differs from the examples of the real life.
'Snažil I have to inform the students on what is possible, the likely, credible and impossible,' says Vacker.

Despite the 'the destruction of the' must students to study, to create projects and make the final tests.
On a final examination Penn State will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give students no other option than to work 'when it is in the evening of presumed the end of the world', said Restall.
Rates have become enough popular.

But add that, in the Western culture Beast of anxiety that goes back centuries in which people respond to change its surroundings forecasts of the end of the world.
Boom of the speculation caused by the Internet.
Elsewhere in the people of the 'think,' said.
This is happening in the vast majority in the English mluvícím the world.
