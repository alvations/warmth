That is what will happen? CSSD knows no Voldemort or patisserie in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the mayoralty of the capital to understand apparently overcome real language barrier at the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne. Cs "tested" the new council members of CSSD, whether they know the argôt who was born in recent years in the mairie, when it was the coalition partners currently heading to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that cream policy of Prague initiated during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known.
At least they say.
"That is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a jeunôt in the political pragoise responded Lukas Kaucky, the elected to test the culture of the" godfather " of vocabulary.
And as regards the political Loranger's, the elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression among those that you propose that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
The vocabulary, the daily Aktualne. Cs issued expressions in June this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, drafting chose 6 examples, particularly those associated with the town hall of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf hole in Prague," go to the patisserie, "Sinews of beef," betrayal of the capital "and" entôler.
Three of the elected representatives have agreed to the quiz, the quatrieme - Antonin Weinert, to lead education in Prague in the future - has promised first interview but then not won the telephone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has refused the test.
"I don't any of these things and how fun the representatives of citizens' democracy: I shall not give my opinion."
"I am currently in the way we are going to understand in the context of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not recognize apparently in the legend above, it is the Janousek -influence contractors and friends of the former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"It is the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky and adds: "But I know of newspapers."
"I am going to pay a language," jokes t.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - we believe in the sense of "go to the patisserie."
"It is, I think, to move in a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of Janousek companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that it derives its knowledge rather newspapers and not of any vocab that it would use.
According to the candidates to tests there is no argôt lexicon in social democracy.
"I took board with colleagues and it appears that we have really not something of this type."
"It is quite the names sometimes uses abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, that Party members call Hulda.
"I called Briza to school but I don't know if I call as says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily present. Cs tested the name and way.
Poppy Weinert elected as members of the Party or the least friendly Petit-Goâve old, the Representative Miroslav Boisvert, who drew attention to him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little joujou."
The nicknames are also the only admit use inside the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky not love hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel. Cs recorded another nickname for this president Prague.
"Doctorate in law from baton" recalls post-CCH that Petr Hulinsky received his doctorate in law JUDr. At the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture "witch," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women reported witch have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
That becomes "witch" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely this fate."
"We do not judge the young women in good health as they participate in the work and give children," says sister who handles in the capital of this West African countries, Burkina Faso, in a special facility for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this "social measure" unusual.
He has published a brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case involves a "problem."
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso does not read," warned the newspaper Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72 year-old woman died after having been tortured by three women and one man and burned with oil they had doused.
It is the server of the BBC which has forwarded this information.
Criminals say that it was bad.
According to their version oil used for ritual onctions is emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, it seems, when the team has wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witch" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a contractor 42 years of Burkina Faso: "Humans eaters minds have always represented a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia no later than the last year has even seen the President himself participate.
"The President of Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch hunt, it seems, would have been involved in his death and would be tried by the black magic to kill the President."
"Shamans of Guinea near come to the rescue, led to the firm presidential Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal care of the President, men and women randomly selected dansdes villages in Gambia," said in a message the organization " Amnesty International.
At the farm people imprisoned had to drink a herbal potion hallucinogenic effects that cause other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.

The leasee Bakal: the poèles heat, he signed a higher rent.
A man imposant came through the door of the centre of the corporation's customer NGN "coal baron" Byty Bakal Zdenek, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
A record cantered in the arm with three new lease contracts for three apartments: the sien, that of his daughter and his son who is currently serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent in these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 son faces from next year for a flat 2 + 1 second class 4,100 Wreaths.
"And there was no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract his son the man who has the power of signature.
"But I signed when even" explains it to motié in anger and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD apartments. Banking which has described the nouelles lease conditions as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when will be issued a notice to explain the methodology to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One said, the other said something else" in the eyebrows.
Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, it is expected that most of the apartment in the Czech Republic, which rents do not reflect the market price.
Aktualne. Cs decided to visit for this reason personally "laboratory."
The waiting room of street GAR Havirovska is one of four in the region of Ostrava and it is already full Tuesday to 16-09-2008 hours of the morning.
Beside the door stands a custody of a security company with a device to call clients.
A special button, "rent-and 2011-in" is lit on the touch screen.
The only pressure and a paper with a number fate of the aircraft.
You do not have the time to read your number "US$157" your already illuminate on the big screen in the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to apply to people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to settle current problems as everywhere - calls for repairs, events on insurance and others.
In the region of Ostrava, the people of more than 44,000 apartments portfolio of NGN receive the letters with the new lease agreements in their mailbox since around mid-November.
GPB Byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for the new rent is open to the public since 18 November.
"It works for almost a week, it is still in the trial" responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the wicket when the customer is presented as a journalist.
The déragulation and the old flats of minor Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The region's Vice-President of the parliament and from Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported fairly sustained before the elections and this Bosniak local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They have not even changed was.... N body-board in the wc, relieves introducing the man mentioned.
However, it is, according to employees, pensioners who have come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised NGN in a special offer.
It is a rebate of half of the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires who have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the window "deregulation" street Havirovaska is really not plagued by the questions.
"Among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 sun-drenched for rent," says the employee at the box office.
And yet GAR porpose on its website that in the individual interviews windows on the rent when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent is an independent tribunal which will take the decision.
"It is not threats but only to inform on the legitimate and unique way to act legally," says GAR on its website.
"Here nobody will go to court" believe one of GAR uçed Byty and the man in the street to the centre of clients with him.
"I 13,000 Wreaths pension and I still have 5,000 kroner to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr Zaoralek media request that nobody sign and therefore the people expect," says she.
In the Czech Republic regulation of rents ends with the beginning of 2011 and increases, are an economic necessity, according to GAR Byty.
"And, moreover, the current rents are still not the level necessary for simple maintenance funds for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, Director of the residential portfolio of society GAR Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the fund for housing which makes the leasee anger is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 GPB has been with the rents invest-in apartments 4 billion in four years of 2011 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung the ceiling in upholstered armchairs facing the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, however, repeat some information in red.
"The increase is 15% in 2011 rent and not less than 31200 apartments over 90% of NGN apartments."
"And this is always the most 7.50 CZK m² per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38% only 400 apartments GAR portfolio.
"In those instances, it is an increase of a very low amount CZK 19.66 m2," adds NGN.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
GPB Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a gradual but radical increase on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money to rent increases (see the graph) is made to the apartments in the form of heating economies - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
Nursery school, too, is part of the offices have understood the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
Nobody could have expected that it also houses a mini nursery school with everything they need - the walls of colours, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a playground miniature on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can make the children of employees of Arch. Design.
The company projects - architectural Arch. Design. the workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has detaÎled its business kindergarten mini-activists since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age to make children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time that down time work contracts, nursery school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by the company Arch. Design. in the context of its social program.
The builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a job taking with the care for children.
These are the employees of Arch. Design. themselves who have imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain a staffing of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-activists kindergarten is financed by the resources of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (up to 2.8. CZK). They were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure a qualified staff as well as the implementation.
After the use of the staffing of funding (two years) Arch Nevatia. Design obligation after 3 years of operating the minidisks nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is society Economy rating that has helped make the staffing request.
The care for children is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a teacher throughout the day mother caring for children. Children can go to kindergarten without age limit, but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who will replace.
The operation of the school is flexible depending on the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although agise individual care and education, comparable to the minidisks nursery school program is for pre-school education.
The children are not only play but a quality education is also assured - the early preparation for school benches are taught English.
The class is equipped not only of toys and games imaginative but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a positive and friendly environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to seek the children in a remote school workplace parents.
Parents use their time to work in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between employee and employer.
Arch. Design and is among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The house in bone fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look in the domestic Gaudi.
The toît looks like the back of a prehistoric saurien, the stairs to a backbone of dinosaur and balconies to fish gueules open.
This is the house $2,223,334 Battlo in Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local Kulturens bone the nickname.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, tiles and mosaîque fragments, front re-articulate scales and everywhere present curves, that is all that is ypique for the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudi.
The front-side façade of the house year-particularly its lines of dream, its colours and textures pleasant reminiscent nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation foot-powered thought with precision geometry, the pace and order.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of colour is strengthened.
Forms is also reflected in the domestic roll and the twisting with the same extent.
The wood copy waves executives of windows, the balustrades, decorative elements of doors, the oeilleton and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the street merchant Eixample Passeig Gracia neighborhood's at number 43, was born of the construction of a house in 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Re-constructing house is made for two years and completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich businessman, first insisted on the scrapping of the vieile building and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as home multiple housing was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that are born decorations for an apartment in representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the facade has also worked for other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo began with a cooperation to achieve between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other Gaudi works.
The local have dubbed the home to gladden just after the finish because of its "Maison bone" organic forms.
Others, given the specific mechanism to open windows have called "the house that baille."
It is said that on top of the building there was a sword similar to that of St. Georges the boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi was in its time a single system for the home central heating, with the aeration vents and chimneys typical.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the establishment Gaudi has not complied with the directives of building then and has not been hindering by them.
At the start of construction permits from the city was built, knowing, of course, that the data brought on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after finishing the council was horrified and requested changes.
He did not like, for example, the members of the council that the pillars of the construction empiettent public on the sidewalk.
He never had to change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city EPP-ED's Battlo asked (and Brodec satisfaction) permission to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common lounge and the third a private room and a portion of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a 9000-.
The entire house of six floors is shared by a staircase that leads up to an independent toît terrace.
All angles and the straightaways were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by amregates walls.
Gaudi worked the modern concept of liaison spaces.
The joint party may be linked completely by opening the doors of double-banking and high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received new facades a non-traditional toîture and two floors.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, blue glass and white tiles with which is decorated the courtyard and the wells of lights.
The game in two colours gives a maximum of light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Battlo home that has been registered in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund UNESCO may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the more spacious and the most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
Owners have decided to cross it in 2002 to the 150ème anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they have found that it is a lucrative business and they have broadened the scope of visits to Spaces' and the attic including the benchlands of toît.
In the monument is not really expensive ticket and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, the groups and the holders of tourist maps are 20% discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its tourelles fantastic, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: women have other criteria than men.
Not ostentatious, but rather the quality of the surface area reserved for the 30dB, so the mattress and a sommier provide a real basis for a bed.
They must of course complement harmoniously to appeal to a specific user.
During the several things are decisive choice: weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of internal in which we will place the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the house of campaign where you do not sleep continually latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight polyurethane standards mattress.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and, if they remain on a solid gameboard, they retain the moisture. Mould can also train.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends time clear abroad where it is often used mattresses very thick with a rammollissante layer, feel hardly naturally low and hard surface.
"This is all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and the coast, they need mattresses rammollisante with a layer of foam lazy."
"Such mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes have a disorder of the nervous system that take wrong" information "joints and the skin," Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in the upholstered furniture.
That is why there are a few years the mattress with foam lazy conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Today everything, Tempur marcia, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico for example appropriate mattress.
You do not need to be a guy NHL to assess a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
She make optimum its rigidity and its form in the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
There is no pressure on you and you do not go back into the night as after a difficult match.
You simply sleep better.
The foam lazy works as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of mattress based on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm by 180 cm.
For the beds in one place, the singles' for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient to visit.
"It is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should ask the hands of comfortable with elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers - matelassiers and decorators dedicated to the issue of healthy sleep for several years and ergonomics furniture and teaches in the specialized schools.
For a bed to two places everyone needs its own sommier and mattresses, attention, however, during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will set up the sommier at different heights and this is not feasible on all executives of bed.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattresses springs at least 15 cm, that intend to form and ventilation layer at least three centimetres.
"The touchable or sit-stand on the mattress you must not feel springs," warned Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of sommier.
The bed - sommier, when the mattress and siamoises are united as sisters, the sommier has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress aèrent very badly; we must not washing, which is commonly auhourd' Hui.
And since during the night it exudes 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a great (and closed) Sieves.
For this the specialists refuse to advertise on a life span of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
But his but.
And for this a board of experience of the sellers: for a mattress of 120/mitigating, for the lining of the mattress, give up hygiene or washing but add rather a mattress of protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and washing.
And even if nowadays Lone-parenthood to produce coatings with closing up for the whole, that after the opening was two parties (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) if not manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when a fight between a small weight and a lorry cut in a ring.
You in your bed a rigid gameboard instead of a sommier?
Never!
The maximum for a bed to visitors for a single night.
However, équipez gameboard (if there is not) of aeration holes and use the mattress springs with a minimum height of 15cm with Add-to-Water springs (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For the box slats with roles slat unique position, latex mattresses or Aeranautical sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex-based and coconut), are the ideal but it is always better for you to have a mattress with slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the bottom part of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress to several positions must not take mattress springs because it does not change of position.
Alongside the fine-tuning of the rigidity of slats can also install what is called a womb-to-tomb shoulder.
It is a special link slats that allows us to pressure or accept the lamelle for the shoulder of the Dungeness "fits."
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the backs," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by the manufacturers of mattresses for the "male" have begun to use a rammollissante area in the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer new more soft surface hip.
For the most difficult customer there is a over-wing box or platelets with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure is released in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattress and sommier, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow; the pillow should support the head and its peaks must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm preferred for example the Scandinavians.
When one is lying on the side, the pillow to level (with the cradle to shoulder the sommier or the rammollie area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the first straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also the organic mattress.
The raw materials based on pétrôle, which manufactures polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use precisely soybeans.
"The word Bio for mattresses means that the heart is made of natural products," Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are used for the coating mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add macro-econometric capsules that develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract birch plants for the mattress surface absorbs heat and any cooling of the body, "the man, coatings" hotter burn " women.
The extract of red pepper accelerates the blood-stream and is therefore more hot for sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses manufactured from cold foam (she pores with a cellular structure law.24 more respirante than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities cold foams provides mattresses polyzones who know exactly where to find the head, the lower back and feet.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 kroner and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Save for the mattress and the sommier is not simple.
It may in time be in the context of special actions of the manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Such as the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with foam memory Memory beneath kroners 11990 surface.
We can obviously take the second free.
The era of foams lazy or viscoélastiques with an open cell structure and a large thickness was last with the Tempur "cosmic" at a pace.
It started as for NASA parceque astronauts were in the start-up of the huge load factors.
The Tempur rammollit in the heat and, instead, is hardening in the cold.
It adapts perfectly warm human body and distributes optimum pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoélastiques foams use not only for the mattress but also for the products for health, such as special pillows for the feet that alleviate the legs and the veineux system.
Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or of the same type.
The devices to follow the people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child leads them more people to think monitor through a GPS.
The system, put in place early to seek out the cars can equally well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as for example the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now so large that a box of matches but will soon be the size of a show.
The case of the small Anicka moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to confuse their privacy.
"We are trying to say to all that this is not principal--but but just another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met with such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for reasons of security, added Pilin.
He said children should always know what is used "the box" and how to use in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws the attention that if the child does not want to wear something of this kind on it in débarassera.
"And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to get rid of something when they do not want to be under control."
"The phones, which can cut such tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," said Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of aircraft to assist in case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it is a whaler prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as will develop the tracking devices, they (criminals) will also seek the because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals are always ahead of the police," said psychologist.
She confesses that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of society RC Monitoring, which offers both for cars and for people tracing services, says that to have this type of aircraft can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
"The device can be paramétré so that it is issuing regular after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains the final position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices were also a inclinomètre who noted immediately the position of the person who has slipped and is found in the extended position nothing," says Cech.
According to him the so-called intelligent mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after the formatted with a special prologiciel.
The problem of current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those that the pendentif is the size of a box of matches to smaller telephone equipment.
We can always lose.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"It will have the advantage that any aggressor will not recognize the tracking device."
"Or it will after a certain time, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
The tracking device is developed in the form of bracelet or pendentif, the utilisiera always the same technology that to draw cars.
It is a position at the GPS-derived through a combination of acquisition systems (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a mobile phone to alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many cordeaux détonants that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with but it can take two years.
The army has bought for C$445 kilometers of cordeaux used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased US$224 kilometers.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years ago.
The problem is that the life of cordeaux is two to four years.
The army has bought cordeaux détonants Company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the achât FP's Dnes a huge amount of cordeaux détonants that the soldiers use 60 kilometers per year.
According to the calculations of reserve to hold made by the pyrotechniciens of the army, that FP's Dnes has contacted, it is clear that even the generals, the officers with a command, secretaries or the personal household should have a year to explosives each year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister for Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 kilometers of cordeaux détonants.
At this distance corresponds 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army reserves could support themselves for 10 years.
If it is true that for basic training of each new professionals it is enough to more than 2 m cordeaux détonants, as the experts, this means that the army with its new purchase assured - with the use of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years ago mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to the Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and the shooting sessions are limited because of the needs of money.
About the lack of linen body is not talking about.
"And I do not take the lead if they buy in such a large quantity of cordeaux détonants."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"For us the military is a good client that we are trying as traders be content," said the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argues the achât of hundreds of kilometers of cordeaux détonants by the fact that the army will these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reported however of cordeaux only four years of life détonants and the pyrotechniciens of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go up to four years," said one which does not want his name published criticism of the army.
The period of life past, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrates and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument the department is a discount due to the amount to 445 kilometers of cordeux détonants.
"They have cost 60% less than the provision of the past year of 245 km," says the Pejsek spokesman the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of détonants pyrotechniciens cordeaux police that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500-meter.
And the police order only the quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifetime.
It has been established for pyrotechniciens security reasons and to be able to more flexible more modern and more reliable détonants types of cordeaux.
The Ministry of Defence today has big problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men preparing to move, Cap.452 on the Rhine.
In a few years expected this FP's that Czech army Dnes contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old cordeaux détonants that it buys today "cheap."
Until today I take advantage of contacts that I have achieved through competition.
The sale under franchise his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, contractor of 28 years.
His adventure to achieve is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec lacked a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
His savings on what he had gained when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small 5 apartment building half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in trosième year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment gravehouses foreign workers.
It reinvests the benefit in the building it transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his action contractor allowed him to open Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The more comfortable among them was until recently the four-star Pytloun hotel design.
This year he came another quality identical.
"We just sign a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates for the franchise Pytloun hotels have shown," the number 1 entrepreneurs of the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a hotel in large scale has served in the competition the victory of the entrepreneur of the year, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought him popularity and be known over Libérec and its environs.
"The people I recognized in the streets, I often contentedly and, I must say, that it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
This is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said that it uses up to now his contacts and knowledge that he would not have been able to obtain a different way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain trade relations.
According to him, the famer linked to achieve has had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I observed among them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job of us all together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the purpose of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind.
Those who came seeking Slovansky dum price for first place in the competition for the Firme of the year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The board has rewarded the efforts with which he has transformed a workshop equipment to Ceska Skalice in a firm turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only my also my collaborators and has increased our self-confidence to fight against the competition," said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property, it has not hesitated for a long time by the Communists, has refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a society with few peers in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
He became after 18 years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has been known in the public not specialized after grantedon achieve the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to really better know the trademark Farmet but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they collaborated with a company which obtained the largest achieve in their country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year ot went just Farmet ldans the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made from the economic results for 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
Top of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technology.
"We have not escaped obviously in this situation."
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we dûmes restrict our production and even sack," Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society should know that from time to time we need to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation properly and have retained bénéficiares results, even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However Farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the appropriations, have strengthened the presentation of the society in double-banking - international exhibitions and won the top awards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
All leaves us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires go back and the number of employees also with them.
"The new winner I wish this nice feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which eliminates unreasonable regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdité of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The survey inglorious winner this year on the Absurdité of the year was the obligation to provide in the offices of the documents that employees can get online.
Over one-third of 4,000 voters have voted for it.
For example, the social affairs authorities asked a paper from the register of commerce, while the official can get two mouse clicks.
Change thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will ask the extract of the trade register for controls of insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Administration social insurance (CSSZ).
Highlight all regulations and orders that companies and contractors must meet in Czech Republic and remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this competition for the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If the last year 1,000-3,000 voting occurred, it is at least 4,000 this year who have made their voices heard.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the various legal obligations that only curb the company, and increasingly.
"We are perhaps the number of documents to fill for the tax returns to the top places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world does not improve the situation in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is the property.74 place as regards the conditions for the company, or 8 seats compared to last year.
The competition for the Absurdité of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can make each year administrative and bureaucratic nonsense in late September, last time before the close of the competition.
To make the website at firmaroku banking. Then, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for "the antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on the site. firmaroku. banking/absurdita and at ihned banking.
The Absurdité who received the greatest number of votes is declared winner.
Until the last survey of the last year, it is a hundred-odd, or more precisely 105 regulations and décrêts who have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "runner-" of the competition, therefore one of the nominees is for example the requirement that the vehicle maintenance motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that the contractors with 20 employees, paint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins in early November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a 'happening' involving regularly personalities of the public and political life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized businesses in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot function when the state puts âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove the absurd décrêts is not a weapon in the water.
In 2007, which did not appeal to the people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual company at the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibit or pilgrimages with a booth.
This obligation was removed with the ammendement of the Act on the individual enterprise.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Office of the service a trip for a foreign employee on 30 days, has been removed with the text of Act on what we call the green card.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdité of the year 2009 has been the décrêt for physiotherapists have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category reward firms responsible socially.
Are assessed environmental, humanitarian projects, training or even sports.
The novelty of this year of Hospodarske Noviny contest, which is already there for 5 years, is the category called the Firme Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the support to the company reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the firm Vodafone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the me-this competition of the year 2010, organised by the firm Vodafone, have registered companies that did not achieve with a long-term goal only for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich inspirations and an article independent would be published.
Although the subject of their business is different one another can see their business support and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns people with disabilities and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic is not the society of prologiciels pragoise And Netera that supports the establishment of informal sports teams for their employees who then participate in number of tournaments in various sporting disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of Pardubice is the Isolit society-the Bravo for 17 years the main contributor to the endowment which sponsors children with disabilities.
Caring for employees with health problems, we can cite still The old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad which employs more than 70% and, for this, won the title of the firm Responsible for the central region of Czech-Moravian which is placed third in the region in the Firme competition of the year organized by Vodafone.
Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won more flexible working hours for having introduced and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average, and, without proportionellement, loss of wages.
The board also déverné the title because it achête priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the close and cares about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as possible for our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the Executive Director of the company.
The company responsible IT Enlogit of Usti Region also think about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop ergonomic chair and a keyboard, encourages their work at home and use the services of catering of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We support the foundation the man in the shadows that helps Roma community," said Ondrej SUCHY the representative of the company.
The last is, also for its activities, a society of Lavage and cleanup of the region of Karlovy Vary, who participates in the pensions of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, the increase of qualifications and recreation," said Joseph Strapac of the bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
Were automatically enrolled in the class society, all regional finalists for the competition for the Firme of the year of Vodafone, which had responded to the questionnaires attached document for registration and had referred to the organizer before 15 August.
Harder or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition for the firm but were not disqualified from the competition" main "Firme of the year of Vodafone."
"The independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the principal of the Firme competition of the year," Karel Goldman Bison&Rose organizer of the agency.
The Fund for the Lands Plzen, the police made the arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Fund for the Lands Plzen, anti-corruption police carried out arrests in recent days.
Detectives have spent the hand-cuffs at the local contractor and consumer-merchant estate Lubos.
He was tried to manipulate precisely a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed ground is achieved by a candidate determined.
It had to pay Lubos G. half a million kronor.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police continues a person for insider trading in the context of a tender and a public concour." said the newspaper Pravo the Parquet leader Zelena Antonie Plzen, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more information because the investigation is ongoing.
The police were called after 24 hours the contractor of 46 years in freedom.
To know how it could affect a public competition, we can only speculate if little official information.
To a question of Pravo, the spokesman of the Terrains Lubomira Fund Cerna said that the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen on a separate place of work, and, during the public competition.
"It was a client and in any case of an employee, she says.
The public competition, according to Cerna as true name "call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the land" and is put in place when occur several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people, in the framework of the appeal, propose a higher value of their resitutions rights that must be addressed before being announced the value of the land."
"According to the rights proposed a ranking of 5.2.2.b. is put in place and the Fund transferring Terrains then the ground to the person who has proposed the highest rights," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information about the people who had registered to the appeal and as it is bénéficiare himself, also, a person as having purchased a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to field candidates not participate in the competition.
And he cashing probably withdraw.
Which explains why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts beyond the FdT standardly (Terrains Fund).
It appeared in the case of the former leader of the FdT Vaclav Sankot was prosecuted in the criminal for having published land for which we had already published the decision to set up a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had for example land earmarked for the construction of public communications, specifically instead should be built the artery's access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he échangea with the town hall for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The mairie was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardising the construction by a blockade of land.
Households will pay a surcharge of a hundred Wreaths monthly for housing.
Households will from January pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will increase also.
The families will therefore from January from their wallets until a hundred Wreaths monthly more than now.
Electricity increases 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2% more expensive, in certain localities you will have to pay up to a tenth of the provision of water and in many places will also be more expensive central heating supplies.
The increase in electricity should be close to households apartment 100 Wreaths anuellement more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced the price of electricity because of the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy sources, including the photovoltaÏques batteries.
The gas increase moderately but of course when people most need to heat and thus the greater consumption.
We can therefore count a hundred Wreaths.
Although the electricity and gas are increasing in the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest common planning the price increase.
For example, or Hradec Kraloce Pardubice households will pay starting in January for the central heating nearly 50 Wreaths more per month, the families of Libérec pay more than 1,000 Wreaths annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9% for water and sanitation for the case where the city is increasing rents infrastructure.
If the rent does not change the Prague will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will be part of the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already higher, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
The price of rent will increase significantly in the 450 thousand lettings from January - at the end of regulation.
For example the ICC Byty society that has Usti nad Labem nearly 2,500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by society.
Rents regulated that pay people in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase next year of 10 percent.
Czech children saoûlent rum and fernet. The beer is not fashion and is slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks watch-type most often those who are saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years, between the hands of the doctor.
Children who are cared for at the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of physicians who face similar children's départments admissions hospitals.
"The beers or wines are no longer fashion because it takes time to be saoûl."
"The trend is really the spirits," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the department of the hospital child in Central Bohemia Horovice.
"When they succeed in father-knows-best in the cupboard to chiper a bottle, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka prévalent'.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix with fruit juice and thus not feel," explains the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the hospital Motol, gives also right.
"In general, it is rum or fernet."
"It is now fashionable in particular in the alcohol elementary schools."
"In some cases, it has acted to slivovice they re-prioritised of the house," said Jurinova.
According to the Chief of Department Pélikan, see drunken children aged 13 to 14 years for admissions to hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to joining Horovice last year, it was Motol, where he practised 10 years precisely in Pediatrics where ambulances carried schoolchildren nearby Sheail drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"It acommencé his career 12 years ago when she was shallow-bury with 3.5 per thousand alcohol dansle blood with a mixture with the extasy," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was at the Parc des Expositions Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting is that it became not bizarre to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours," said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinvolvement parents or their tolerance outside the joint deal with the fact that their reject drinkin' drink that is the main cause of the anti-alcoholism new children.
According to the experts, however, not dependence, exists.34 in the strict sense, for the children.
"Under the name refers to a dependency chronic alcohol several years with all the resulting phenomena, but that is not found in children."
"Among those who use alcohol to repetition, it is rather a back - ground significantly adverse social, family," explained the head of Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesman, approximately 40 drunken children have been hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic of Pediatrics at Motol.
In the stastistiques that the cases are integrated with a grâve illness requiring hospitalization.
Drunken children who are after emergency care brought back home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
The case of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to exsite Pélikan three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day of witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by bad results after welyoung instead they are celebrating the start of the holidays."
"Of course I lived in the day witch an admission of 7 children drunk a single shot," said Pélikan.
The child drunk who has spent the night in the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in the best position that returned home and is suffering the aftermath of the "hung over."
Headaches the morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutrients the body needs.
"They are better off because they spend a great evening and a mild revival, and nothing hurt."
"They are only surprised where they are," says Pélikan knowing that in time it spoil the good humour of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and hospital intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of wreaths.
"From time to time, I applied it as a means of education with these children how drunk claimed and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their management in decline, which should recover from the parents expenses related to care, do not treat drunken cases of children.
Two planes L - 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two planes L - 159 of five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft $2,223,334 Bill 295M, have departed Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer $2,223,334 - EADS.
This is the first time that the devices of this kind become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad in the framework of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is the biplaces L - 159T1 versions that were until now in service in the Czech army and who were flying.
Lestrois remaining devices are monoplaces versions of the L - 159.
They swallow derzeit in Aéro Vodochody and through trade - the firm Omnipol last week - has taken into account.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical from Vodochody aircraft is unknown.
"The aircraft L - 159 monoplaces planned for the exchange were made on aircraft stored for a long time without cause additional burdens or investment for the Ministry of Defence."
"The biplaces L - 159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without since the department was signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four monoplaces L - in two biplaces un-utilised 159.
The army took delivery of the first plane in July, the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment in some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract is clearly stated that whoever takes the aircraft L - 159 is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots of NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one that takes into account in determining how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
There is some time noviny Hospodarske announced that the Spanish army is not interested in the L - 159.
The exchange of five L - 159 for a $2,223,334 aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft to 3.5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched tender and has contacted directly EADS.
The direction of the defence arguments while the exchange provides a future export L - 159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought Aéro Vodochody 72 aircraft and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft $2,223,334 will probably legal implications.
The European Commission has complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the Court of Justice because the aircraft would have to be selected in the context of a tender to the European level and in any case by contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three $2,223,334 aircraft, the latter should arrive at the airport in Prague Kbely in two weeks.
A longer index that the annulaire is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the annulaire are exposed to a lower risk of having a prostate cancer.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This might depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of fingers serves as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, particularly for the men before age 60," proclaimed the coauthor of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger and could help determine what men should be subject to the test of prostate cancer, including by combining with the genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors such as family health antécedents, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 it has followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with cancer of the prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand men healthy.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annulaire.
For them as for the 19% of those who had the fingers of the same length, was found the same likelihood of a prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annulaire the risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 years the reduction of risk has reached 87 percent.
The length of two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - including different levels of sex hormones which is set out the child in the womb.
At least testosterone longest an index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that aid in the development of a prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur, geneticist EC-Czech Vacla Paces entschieden and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said to CTK that he is aware of this study, but that it appears not, it seems, that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely proven."

The US has a new "smart weapon"
The US military has sent Afghnistan a new "smart" weapon, known only under the name of -25 XM code.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a specific super-premium Familleureux
The projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few metres.
The special caliber ammunition for the rifle 25 mm developed and containing a highly explosive, works as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed so that they explode on contact with the target, but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
We can therefore use against an enemy that hides behind a barrier, a wall or a gap.
It is not protected up and when he falls murderous tax-restructuring Éclats steel rain, it can out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of XM -25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier is used mainly in such a way that he found the target, he sends a laser beam which determines the distance, gives a specific point of calculation.93, according to which it corrects its C1045 site and based on the trigger.
"Let's say you referred to 543 meters."
"When you pressure relaxation, the weapon is responsible and draws the distance of 543 metres more or less 1. 2, 3 metres, said Audette.
400 jobs off-shored
The group Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 staff will transfer to Astro Park their place of work which is currently at the office building in Mareinbader Place in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As said Wednesday the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women up to now, located on the Marienbader of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, enormous complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße Niederrad unit.332 in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman said that medium term, the group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The supply of rental has been extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open area of Astro Park offices to better suited to the way work collaborators.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just leasee.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt - Niederrad is for us a crucial location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region has raised yesterday the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of the economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been won.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith on instead of implementation."
Fujitsu is appropriate for the city and its implementation is a major boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations would not change the difficulties of the manufacturer of computers face the owner of the building in Marienbader Place.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to avoid a place if exceptional remains vacant for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
It was ten years ago, the building of the Place of City Hall, used so far by the company Fujitsu and the "small vertical" neighbour, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad Place, were part of the controversial project of building a spa.
Result of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and City Hall. It prompted numerous critical, not only because of the impressive development surfaces that once served as parking in part, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for the travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, have moved into buildings.
In 2006, The German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien - Chancen repurchased buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate funds Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were resold to Spanish society Falcon Real Estate Investments SA Madridbased.
The group Fujitsu, headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it puts computers and servers at the disposal of businesses and provides the essential service.
Its branch office in the region of the Rhine - Main is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu surely much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt - Niederrad. Other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square metres took lease in the building Astro Park.
This complex 20 years old, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, the seat of the Conféderation houses across the electrotechnology and electronics industry.
Expulsion of Amazon.ca's on-line.9 - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is having more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon.ca's has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently in England.
The United States, the Wikileaks is attacked with still more force.
The group of e-generation activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server housed up here in America and is now seeking an ISP in Europe.
During this time, the leading US Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon.ca's server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," indicated Wednesday (local time) e-generation activists at the origin of gratae.13 via the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, the e-generation company, Amazon.ca's, had abolished the Wikileaks documents of its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, e-generation activists have used the Web Service Amazon.ca's (Aws) in order to be able to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon.ca's, "they should stop selling books."
The television channel CNN, citing the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon.ca's has forbidden to Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation conducted by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon.ca's site to orchestrate a boycott against him, told the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon.ca's to take this measure earlier given the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said Senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of EPR's servers.
"Wikileaks is illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it puts our national security in danger and jeopardize the lives around the world," according to a press release of independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information disseminated by the London newspaper The Independent, the Australian 39 lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The e-generation activist constantly called intrigues orchestrated by its opponents prosecutions against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats have been made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
This is why Assange fears particularly for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly was reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the responsible revelations made by Wikileaks is pursued and executed for treason.
In Canada, the advisor to the Chief of Government Mr. stephen Harper said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman of the US President, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and released recently, to engage in espionage activities.
"I do not know exactly why we must deal with the opinion of an individual owner of a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The US government should now move completely to test the protection of its data bases.
According to a press release from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre for the fight against terrorism, has been appointed to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House has also the desire to check the means by which any administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US government has announced that he wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have implemented to come into contact with them," said the spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect if necessary."
The University of the Glace
To the Bologna " Gelato University, preparing confectioners of ice the best seasons of the year.
The three-day orientation course organized for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from throughout the world.
In fact, where the ice?
The Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the ice confiseur somewhat old-fashioned, ss.40 cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of manufacture of the ice.
The turbine ice removed ice cream in chilled using a spatula, the cooperating-has has in the gaufre and then begins to sell.
To know, there is no need to go to Anzola dell' Emilian in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières founded the University of vested-rights ice ice in 2003 so that the cream of its machines everywhere meet Italian high ideals.
The three-day orientation course organized for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also available on the ice of chocolate and spanning several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in the private glacerie.
In full crisis of quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their desire smooth on the ice.
This time, the 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education came from California is buff of the Slow Food movement. He wants the country to propose a European product quality in the future of the industrial Glace.
Berlin Anke and is advisor business management wants, after a few years, learn something from challenging for the NERVES singular of the profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another time Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning woman came because his children love the icecream 98/4802.
The master-distributor glacier Luciano Ferrari is ideal characteristics perfect ice.
Determines not only the good taste, but also the soyeuse flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano not forgotten during the training the icing on the cake for National superstructure and, in general, the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in the manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pays basic ingredients such as milk, cream, to milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large blender heat to 85 degrees colder through an electronic program, then immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a valve installed on the machine: it out a white pasteurized cream, foundation for all kinds of ice milk.
The coach is immediately beset by question: is it possible to manufacture ice using only the natural substances without output-stabilising?
How can people unleash the pleasure staff of the experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who does that ice-surveillance "made from natural ingredients," perhaps nevertheless used stabilisers: the more often a natural product, for example the guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using output-stabilising, only sell in a period of 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer croquera nothing other than the ice pellets.
Some amendments to the basic mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"The suppliers will attempt all of you pass dozens of ingredients flavoured."
"However, you should simply try."
In the revenues of fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the icecream made from the mass of white base, adding egg becomes a yellow cream and is, when we add cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all the participants during must move to the use of machines to ice.
Luciano invites in time to make four kinds of Glaces: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnuts with or without eggs in the mass basis, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit icescapeâ? are also subject to the same experience.
More fragrances, more fruit purée: the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely better.
The ice to hazelnuts does not necessarily the taste of the AM1.5, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The ice the kiwi fruit, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit and less water and a little less than output-stabilising.
"Only a balanced mix correctly notes the taste of ice-creams," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: if you use fishing purée with a lot of sugar, it is important that the quantity of sugar is reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for the lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the ice-wine is used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic machine manufacturing base mass support.
There is also a device in which it beats simultaneously the mixture of ice available to make it onctueux and reduced to negative temperatures.
In spite of all the automatisations, small fault-monitoring are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbouille of fruit purée head to toe, éclabousse comrades studies when the control of the huge bowl blender escapes.
The master Luciano is of the opinion that a "J0 incident to happen in each: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experienced the culture of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the expert group Testbiotech which is regarded as an institute independent assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we know," said on Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some reports of what the Chairman of the Group of Experts Efsa for genetically modified, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively to the development of test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified and this is clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The regional-aid drugs.8 match verbatim, by pararaphs, the positions of the Ilsi lobby and bear the mark of the industry which, basically, is controlled by the authorities located in Parma in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech HLADIY a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of the Efsa has recently joined without condition or without a transitional period the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta. In doing so, it has changed camp.
There is little time, Radio Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union responsible for control and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion both the German Federal Agency for the environment that MEPs.
However, the Efsa accepts the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it operates all data, including those in the industry as long as they are of good quality work.
It does not prohibit experts working for the account of the Efsa to forge contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong, among others, in the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr. Then resent the fact that the genetically modified are accepted without any testing of food animals and that it has not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of corn genetically modified cause the scope," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the proteins isolated and not all the GM plant, which does not obtain reliable results.
"If we do not research risks, how can we discover?" asked Mr. Then on an accusatory tone.
It is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific researches since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working on the school Polythenique of Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector increasingly trying to influence or discredit scientists criticism.
That is why, there is barely even researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry control research on security."
The trace of stone
Gsell Uli obtained a total 400 kilo about.
Monday afternoon, it was before the station in Stuttgart with his back tube.
There were manif.
It snowed.
The story is well known: in September, excavators came and started to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was the same: thousands of people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Central Station Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the arrest of construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the limestone-use bivalve molluscs) of Crailsheim, a paved stretch out and rude poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years residing in Ostfildern.
He obtained fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He said enthusiastically: "Small and cheap, simple and land a rock."
It saying that the etched in the line-of-cut, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not known yet what he will do this fragment.
The rocks have the time.
Uli also Gsell.
The Stuttgart vaccinator.Today lead to a former ammunition depot in the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire of stones.
The 44-year-old man is the trade of old stones.
He bought all vaccinator minority-based de-constructing 1958-1962 in Stuttgart.
"This would be a disgrace if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge," he says in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard.
He recounts that he has been the subject of insults and threats when in September, the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing in the business of demolition.
But he has negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained that he could do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it occurs, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 subsequently prevailed one of cyclone-resistant parallélépipède regulation.342 average 80 kilograms whose value is between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some care as memory while hoping also make the reconstruction.
Rongen had 500 tonnes, 25 full loads a truck.
About half is still packed together in the forest, the rest being long sold.
Owners of gardens, park-keepers landscape, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and won everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart turned long "Mäuerle" or limitations of habitat-sensitive grass.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" said Mr. Rongen.
"Had been the political component."
In his car ground, made the turn of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law that it has abandoned. Later, he began to explore the biology before interested by following the computer and eventually becoming a carrier.
And an amateur stones.
It stores 40,000 tonnes.
It raised Trésors everywhere in Germany.
He says that it is the largest gelateria børnepasningsorlov stones.
It is réfrène.
Sand stones carved with art implementation-initial on snow.
"In the past, d'Elles were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says with enthusiasm.
"My favourite Engelskirchen."
It takes the path that rises through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sand Montreal-Pierre, formerly part of the station of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertin."
The parallélépipède was once part of the Neckarstadion gallery in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertin from the prefecture of police, the rougeâtre granite from the cathedral Saint Blasien, the tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, AR-07 efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen believe that once the stones were sculpted in the hand and displaced using simple palans and carts drawn by oxen, it becomes quite respectful.
"This would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in room."
It is not become rich, still less detail.
But this carrier now employs 14persons. In addition, the stone masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass souffleur and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is rewarding," said the recycleur of waste.
Soon, it must go to Cologne.
There also, there are stones to save.
Talent-searching struggle to conquer the potential senior
The counter is experiencing a greater-thananticipated rush.
16 students are lining up to buy bread rolls to salmon, tomato sauce and white - mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automobile manufacturer Volkswagen were invited to a workshop students in mechanical design and engineering.
In the context of a sort of competition of ideas, they must talk trade on the car of the future with the developers of VW, and, in passing, know the Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-to-hand in competition to find best brains and to commit, such as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in the theatres before they arrive on the employment market and that they are courted by the other.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performance of their students, trying to identify the talent in the context of practical projects and loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig auto group amadoue talent.
A young lady of staff sharing 24-months' logo pens, sweets and maps of Volkswagen.
It speaks of the timetable professional internships and.jobs students to young talent; it shows the roads for access to the forum of the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "The students come in contact with the industry and are gaining experience."
"As the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, look more closely the candidates seriously and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. ofharp, A such cooperation is unusual.
It was again, it is the offensive with which seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was instead on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become even more intense.
In goods sectors, companies can no longer recruit their staff through a sorting on a host of candidates.
But they must boast about their reliability and especially woo the hand of highly skilled.
It is The graduates of engineering clusters that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum on the engineering jobs still will.
Dykta novel is in the hunt for talent for the account of KPMG, auditing firm, accounting and consulting.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the race backlighted KPMG - Race, a kind of rally - paper where competitors must find their way to the help of GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they are on the way the United States.
Participants can also visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the business.
Those who must participate decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of cream many candidates fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, senior potential used for the quest of universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the operation-an through the backlighted race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little thing"
For the hunter of talent that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are on the verge of completing their education and want to soon send their applications to our company." he says.
Outside the direct amadouement carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises quite classic R.S.N. participating in trade fairs where they are involved in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve the graduates participating in trade shows."
"For example, the Khoral solar technologies," says Sitha Stübe, director of human resources for Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem related to the succession.
Currently, 35 posts are placed in the competition on the website of the company.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is expensive and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through the university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his end of study among us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced for the specialists of the sun.
That is why the company is trying to make its advertising highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
It has been a long time that money takes the main role in the search for employment.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld sits in 55th place among the top 100 employers of Germany.
The institute is an annual Honour of German employers.
To this end, he -4representative the collaborators on their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the conditions of employees.
The chief of staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this investment will enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
"I think that the candidates are relying mainly on external assessments in relation to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner DEBA (Deutscher Kriegler German d'Académie Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises businesses that want to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a long-term strategy.
He advises clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, herself, this means above all to take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to get attractive is through its own staff," he says.
This is, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal strategy of image, i.e. the creation of the brand image of the employer within its own workforce.
"The staff satisfied form the best messengers."
When treats its employees and that they identify with the company, they are itself--as advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if we played in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeast state of the United States, over the years to come.
The government in Washington gave an equivalent ban A ban and definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon " which is at the origin of this strict ban. This should remain in force at least for the next five years.
Faced with this accident that cost the lives of 11 employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the business sector, had indicated that he was willing to allow the completion of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution and want to reduce the US dependence on foreign countries for the supply of oil.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the oil slick devastating in golf is not, to this day, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing demands for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry set up by Obama must present its findings current December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling freeze after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With more stringent measures to control and stricter security procedures, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after numerous charges of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms in depth.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced would remove the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
The actors in this sector of activity now publicly warned against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case until now.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current survey in the sector by the auditing firm BDO, before the drilling ban Wednesday.
Indeed, the American Enery Alliance regrets uncertainty this sector: "Nobody knows exactly that will change with the regulation."
The investments made in new support projects have been deferred until further order, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni countries is to dry
The water flowing in the rivers is enough brown; it freed up a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
The men live theft, corruption and oil refining.
Akpobari Celestine has a good intention.
"You do not épuisez," launches the environmentalist to journalists for the 11.3.18: "You still enough oil sludge before duckweed."
The Nigerian 37 years has tried to photograph a young bogged down in muddy water up to the chest, as well as the drug-possession fat that surrounds it: this scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water to the colour of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown slicks of crude oil.
On the shore of the river Bodo Jetty, Esther Badom says, once, she collected whole buckets of shrimp here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
It was five years ago, a huge amount of oil gushed from a pipeline exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen capita the small town of Bodo must now pull for six hours to reach fish-bearing waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the world's most polluted regions.
The extent of the devastation is glaringly obvious leafing through the marshes of mangrove bisected by waters.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboating breaks a cradingue brown. Anyone who plunges his hand cut off all covered with oil.
Mangrove emerging soil as of liquorice roots of small sticks. The isolated palm leave sadly hang their fins.
The clouds of birds are seeking in vain, as is usually meeting in wetlands: as soon as the outboard motor stops, an eerily silence on this Uncooperative ire once that looks like a gas station by the smell it freed up.
"What happens here, it is war against the environment," says Akpobari air Celestine sad: "Our life is characterised by a permanent danger for health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni is a battlefield under siege for dozens of years: there are more than 60 years, the first European explorers have entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was later executed. in 1993, the group Shell has had to suspend its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the country Ogoni is prohibited in this society: while more than 2 million barrel of black gold are daily pumped through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines in the whole of the Delta, three times larger like Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni countries are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in the water of the tréteaux steel as bizarre sculptures: is very affectionate "Christmas trees" the heads of drilling holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion until benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time piece, because a constant flow of crude oil flows in the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has passed into the sea during the accident in the super-pétrolier "Exxon Valdez" there are 21 years off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility of the persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question has divided the player.
For the group Shell, pipeline sabotage and the siphonage are responsible for more than 90% of the pollution. The tree-hugging Universityeducated see explosions heads of perforated drilling and pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner begrudged group Shell to focus less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: only the rate of waterpipes IPL-V is "still much higher than alleures."
Some emerging forms of mangroves to a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of work and installed at the free air: they are completely naked and covered work up to the neck.
A fire twinkling under one of the many tons that sometimes related to the pipe, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be répérés: a small illegal refinery.
Heat the oil in the cask for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of drops of kerosene fall and is finally diesel.
It is that Michael and his four colleagues every day four barrels of diesel 300L: "This tells us 34,000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the world's largest producer of oil in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than ridiculously low of barely 40 Euro cents per litre of diesel: because they acquire free their first.
It is offered by the "gatekeepers" who put the network of pipelines in holes across the country of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite misdesignation of the first purified temporarily stored illegally: organized crime networks that are among its members of senior politicians and military, pick up the lion's share of tankers and dumping on the world market.
The militant Akpobari believes that the debate on the question of whether we should attribute the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities to the public or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen were not so profoundly destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
But Between - time, the relations of the Ogoni especially to Shell so deteriorated that it was more that the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps that the operators of other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not the subject of an arrest, but the more they provide bribes.
Even the soldiers mostly originating in the north of the country intend to take as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"At any point of view, this scarf low trick brought our country well," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction flaws in the reactors of the A380
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
In examining a device that has made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas Southam7 had so far more chance: during the investigation, the Australian authority for air safety has found that the reactors of some aircraft A380 présentaient a serious problem of security, and it warns against a possible default of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, specifies in a decision published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have lead to a "catastrophic failure of reactors."
Are concerned the reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft in the series A380.
The company's Airbus Quantas, which had to fly emergency on 4 November in Singapore, among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the French manufacturer of reactors.
It has filed a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court, headquartered in Sydney. This approach provides the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Mr. Alan Joyce, the director of Quantas, said that his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Rooms are spare and the surface was damaged during the fire engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil which is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other tests relating to safety will be carried out on the superjumbos who are also equipped with issues of reactors.
The recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman for the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The problem of security is regarded as sufficiently important to inform all concerned parties.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had stopped to ground its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa has replaced by precautionary measure, the reactor of the A380.
The double-decker plane is the largest airliner flying in the world.
The snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in the transport
Germany covered in white: in one night, the snow fell on almost all the country.
The chaos on all roads, trains and planes are Chemfallow.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is shivering Germany: by freezing temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which led to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow reached 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service has worked permanently, but they have not been able to come out of the snow continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal Office of maritime navigation and hydrography (DSH) expects tidal-wave take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
The piles of snow on the federal highways and on the roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Central warning $US98.18 Meteomedia announced the alert level purple was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it has fallen 30 centimetres of fresh snow that costs and strong winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck at night.
Even in the land of saxe - Anhalt, police authorities have announced severe disruption on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind have led to an interruption of the flow and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall has affected the A4 highway and A9A.
According to the Deutscher U-Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, the trees fallen on the tracks, the caténaires or the needlehandling destroyed.
In Saxony, it has had to interrupt the inter-regional transport Leipzig - Nuremberg.
Sallfeld, in Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supplying 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and beverages.
Winds of snow swept away roads.
The Chutes snow have led to many flight cancellations in the major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman of the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for DRV indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled at Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are more passengers stranded at the airport, despite this just 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening at Ostholstein, a truck driver has lost their lives in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the present layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: here, a truck at a level crossing was caught because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver had lost their lives.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled over on a slippery Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: the snow is still weak and dried, but it tourbillonnera in case of minor gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent winds and fast.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: according to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is seeking buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could potentially up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank just to embellish the headquarters of the group: the twin towers located in the unit.332 business have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their former place of duty.
Now, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the costs of renovation and it seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as wrote the newspaper Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesman has not indicated the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check if it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or sell, and new rental later."
It is that Germany's largest financial institution has already ceded his seat, shortly afterwards.
It is only in the middle of the year 2007 that the bank had acquired the Twin Towers for a sum of 272 million Euro to holders of equity. It had then rehabilitated.
The changes to energy optimization devoured, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would yield of course a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, rebaptisées meanwhile "inter-ballot green," approximately 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, we don't know now if the buildings will be sold again to funds belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the miners buried that have been declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been able to reboard the body because the security situation of the affected wells continues to be precarious.
There are just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth submerged in water.
29 miners whose age is between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had found no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second bang violent, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be increased.
Today, parents and friends held a party to the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a brilliant sun Greymouth submerged in water south of the island New Zealand.
They have observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, was installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfing, had also their place.
The flags were at half-mast to all public buildings in the country.
The Prime Minister John Key NZD$ said participants in the commemorative celebration that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the minor remonteraient to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the of--about has said that he cannot resign themselves to accept the death of his son as long as it has not seen his remains.
The Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemorative celebration.
South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion of 19 November.
The rescuers have begun to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles has explained to reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are misplaced. temperatures burning inside the mine begin to decline.
Goes to hell, warrior!
Is it Splatter the film artificial?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of such former thanks to his film, "Valhalla Rising" saga of veteran.
How public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn has it been thinking in turning point "Valhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is prisoner; it unloads its hangman and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminate its opponents after each other. It seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses of the brutal methods of assassination. when it is bad moods, it severs the gut of its enemies without waiting until they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed says no word on his real name. Even the other characters leave escape, at most, one or two sentences in side-trip a few cries of agony appalling.
Otherwise, there is nothing and festoie in the mountainous incredibly beautiful landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the universe of Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
This would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in the existentialisme and for the excellent travellings.
When a film is several target groups, it is unfortunate that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher," his trilogy on fierce drug trafficker and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but it refuses to make a little more mood in the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality of art and testing in cinema.
Most supporters of cinema art to experience horror in the brain that is spreading around and intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed departed, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a vessel destined to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to be quiet.
It is not so surprising that "Valhalla Rising" has found no distributor of films in Germany and that there are only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, occasionally, hiding behind a bloody and over-the-top appearance.
It is not dialogues in this film, or a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The viewer cannot escape.
Refn gives just a moment of relaxation and stumping slowly throat with freezing images and a grim soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that comes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young boy, held faithfully alongside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are managerled anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed heroes that the mobile never are known, but returned to hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allied themselves in warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Valhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, which was intended the agitation, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious work of $361,668
The agency International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications about a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, still less to submit to the control of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 towards midnight, at least four Israeli I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious form cubique building on the Syrian territory.
It is on the shore of the euphrate, the largest city located near is located 30 kilometers: it is Dair - On.
His name appears in the documents of the IAEA, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built post-CCH with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède rock, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a briefing US intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the name of the nearby, el Kibar, would be fit to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
In contrast, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation involving satellite images blurred.
Through the computer-animation by computer, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant that is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear plant in Yongbyon.
In addition, she has presented photos showing the building located near, even within it.
It seems that the reactor was on the verge of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after Israel's bombing raid, there is barely more information at the time, and even with the time the mystery deepens increasingly.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor to el Kibar, but had peu' signs the country was "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious on this subject and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they see the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They lack tangible evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Questioned about the way it ensures that it is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat UN gave a terse response was that the IAEA had available "documents sufficient to ask questions."
The Syrian have abducted precipitately "unused military building" the rubble and proceeded to an orderly resolution of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by the former Chief Inspector Heinonen Oli, discovered el Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received through a Member State of commercial providers of satellite images showing the moment which followed directly attack. It appears that the latter are louder than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the sponsor anonymous, perhaps Israel, has acquired exclusive.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret atomic program and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has rejected this argument after analyzing particles as implausible.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion on this subject, as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el Kibar and denied access to the rubble of buildings destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said: "We shall never comments on this subject."
Thus the investigation of this case spotlight since June 2008 without that we reach a result and that it "increasingly turning into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as the high-ranking service recognizes a Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, eventually it is a serious violation of the treaty to ban nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, we need to clarify the existence of three other facilities that must have "a functional report" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities here, or what is their function or what we suspect to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj - Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of the neighbouring cities.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) Washington has identified these locations and found on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would be very probably one of the suspects objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly beside it; it is exactly the reason why Syria refuses access of the three sites to the inspectors of the IAEA.
In Vienna, it states that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on military installations.
Indeed, it is an information provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been commuting between the three sites and the stone parallélépipède to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be used in the production of fuel."
It "would not indications regarding sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly working through not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is rigour plausible assumptions regarding the following basic questions: where should have come uranium and could later separated plutonium needed to manufacture of the bomb.
It is unknown if the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded land will have disappeared, nobody will have information on the place of storage rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has been examined in 1998 the salt mine of al-Nedawat, Tibni, located only a few kilometres of el Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In analysing recent photos taken by satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken work of $361,668 in the three sites socially-disruptive and misplaced. huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped under-shooting suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to make. This plan should allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. only the time invested shows what interest the inspectors relate to this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored the proposal.
There was a year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who men-tioned for a few months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the International Atomic Energy Agency has to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open to the future," but it is still reluctant.
This method involves a huge risk: firstly, it requires a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA and a good number of the 35 countries that are represented have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as the diplomat who gives réflechir: "At this point, if at the end they do not find anything"
Love in time of war
It goes wrong since Angelina Jolie has made its debut as a director.
She has written the script itself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell love of its Serbian hangman during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women federations have immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo have been displaced in the last minute in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests have continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a cent9 provisions.22 Angelina Jolie through the United Nations for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Lovely itself ambassador of goodwill of the UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat. There are a few weeks ago, she offered to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"The meeting is to take place in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie said enough about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian that, subsequently, the organization of Hasecic recommended the High Commission of the United Nations to withdraw the quality of Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie she written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of his scenario, has granted after some hesitation shooting authorisation in Sarajevo, but we do not know why not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assures itself that it is political objectives with his film, that it is doing a lot of effort that it is aware of the Yugoslav conflict. It maintains that it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity for all parties involved to speak.
However, it remains vague about the content.
As a second Administra­tion film is circulating on the Net. It is quite different: the enviro-enthusiastic knew well before the start of the war. it meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the Serb concentration camp where the man works as guardian.
This is a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is amourache its executioner."
That the film Jolie has started well before the war, of course.
The pressures on it, and speaks Jolie, is "unfair and based on the information erronnées."
Now, only the fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: with illegally this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let us!
Tonight, everything is again among the Irish.
No trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans howl of joy on bottom of a strong music, they trample feet.
Baileyu - Cork Pub in southern irlande vibrates because the players and succeed in making WAYSIDE table tennis balls at a distance of three metres in cups beer of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer - pong." The winner pockets 500 euros a ticket allowing him to travel in January in Las Vegas in the world championships in beer - pong.
Cian does this Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle game to drink and the computer specialist reserved, these two behaviors are not really well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years seeking fun, to turn on the térébrante issue, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange sense," he says.
"The homeland is so far and I did not work."
Finally: his girlfriend ahead already in Auckland, "in less than two, she has landed her job like responsible for project factual, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of the bleak prospects in the country, two of the three sisters Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin occupies a position of computer consultant in London.
The young are: the situation of most families living on the island are similar to that of tanning.
The experts of the Institute of Social and Economic research indicates that 100,000 Irish soon leave their country.
They foresee a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts materialize, it will be a common emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a great affluently, the 3,328 is now taking place.
The economic crisis, however, affect young Irish, well trained, who have had until now only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social C-73 absurd seemed in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three in ten of less than 30 years old are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes extensively readers' letters written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is going to drift."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but anyone who has the opportunities, and our country is a generation."
"The last to leave extinguished light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of Irish students, sees pointing a darker future because the government only throw dust in the eyes and offers no prospect of future for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to a practicum not paid to another.
It says that his greatest concerns is 50x50 itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However the men as Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue positively.
McLarnon holds a Act-doesn't Khoral "WorkingAbroadExpo" that offers full on the theme "working abroad."
"But the work abroad is new in the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the ranks of the hierarchy," said the responsible.
Its website shows the photos of Web surfers in Australia and the snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a boat, but it guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seàn O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for the engineer of 29 years, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector ème Germany.
A fashion house precisely fate of land to GELSENKIRCHEN.
In January, it will continue to work on other projects Hannovre or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan visit that rarely his native country, because it is involved in a position of extra work, in order to complete to repay the credit contracted to build a house at home.
"The situation is already a little bonkers," he says in crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I won money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live now."
He broke out of an embarrassed laugh crossing the coolers.
The small house is in a residential area with before cared for gardens, expensive cars of major brands are stationed on the access routes.
It was four years ago, O'Donovan has bought the house in common with her sister for a sum of 380,000 euros, funded 100% by the credit.
"It was moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Afraid to see all collapse because of the credit?
Jusque O'Donovan a moment, ressert hot tea and declared: "I don't have children to maintain and I am young; same goes by, I can scratch."
The engineer of the building does not like the Lamentations he hears often these days.
"Nobody should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what was once lived here in the island," he says.
"Work for a time abroad, this is not what can happen worse, perhaps it is this fact that we felt first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea please Cian does this Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his palmarès, It has a few years of work in London. This is the reason why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and for his girlfriend.
But there is still something that worries these days: a celebration to organise the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
It fears that it could turn into evening farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says over a long sip of beer.
"A Valedictory, it seems even disturbing."
"Call it instead an evening of goodbye, relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as the private company.
The crime has become a greater concern that unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest survey Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published in exclusivity by The Economist.
Given that the survey was conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two elements stand out the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the sunny enough mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy rose from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after having suffered a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents from the region were satisfied with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases, but in sharp increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
It was ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If it has held good during the financial crisis worldwide, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have not suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America has reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and has again fallen this year, to 32%).
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inàcio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see Table 5).
About 31 percent say they or a loved have been victim of a crime during the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase of support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents from the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for the development, against 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58 percent believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed countries, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their president left, Hugo Chávez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote tainted
No one expected to have the perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the "outsiders" who wanted to help the country devastated and plunged in fear.
It has presented polling boxes and a new ballot, the ballot papers scattered in the goutières, voting offices ransacked and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who have been displaced following the earthquake in January, instead roamed in the neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually abandon.
A dozen candidates for the presidential, including several suspected favourites, have denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "an election in many respects quite good."
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautiously "that they did not believe these irregularities, serious they are, had necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, the opponents are indebted to René Préval, President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude " Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round expected is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal that the vote be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr." Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In the case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 cédula, needed to vote, were not yet distributed little time before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, it is clear, Haitians do themselves.
The tippy feet to the centre
The weeks after being suddenly widow, Cristina Fernàndez, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, more than 50%; it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet, turn this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernàndez, visibly in mourning, according to which it would give up or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs are still confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has allowed the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
The government of Mrs Fernàndez has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissident members of the Malvinas movement to power rallied to Ms. Fernàndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentary struck in the face one of his peers and where others have accused the government of corruption), the Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to compete," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied the next year, leaving the president even greater flexibility to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9 per cent this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage demands of the unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of the growth and the reduction of poverty, rather than the control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, which was conducted in the falsification of statistics on the official inflation.
Ms. Fernàndez can now moderate these policies?
It has called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been fueled by high world prices for agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boosting growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps the reason why Mrs Fernàndez shows signs of wanting to restore financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring forced debt that Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernàndez seems to be edging towards year agreement with creditor government grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6. 7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could involve a surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But the last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; what looks like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernàndez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer on its side.
If it does so, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very resolutions8.
When the Argentinians will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will be dropped.
If it wants to win another election, it will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many policies of her husband.
Midhundreds Hurrah! For China
Taiwanese voters are geared towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What is Taiwan think of its big brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters are presented on 27 November, 70% of those eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in the context of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has itself become a substitute for the feelings from the continent, having developed innovative business ties, including a free-trade pact partial, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five rights5, it has failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead of this, the Democratic Party, Progressive (DPP), which has looked to the independence of Taiwan, has won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of vote of his party has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event has unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including the aggressive campaign to trucks and flags of mass rally with girls who danced in place minimum.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt has also been committed.
Seán Drafr, son of Lien Chan, honorary chair of the KMT, has made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, injuring and killing a passing.
Strangely, it has not been determined whether the gunman wanted to hurt Mr. Drafr or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing - wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had consequences on the election in leader suspicion on the DPP and shell-fishing voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how the issue of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead of this, the candidates have continued with the plans for the public housing and creating jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence and hate the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid parading its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP was also failing to stir up anti-China sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for his part, has claimed responsibility for confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
We can expect that the Beijing government continues to provide the commercial facilities, in line with its strategy that aims to lure Taiwan, homecoming.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Admittedly, it would like to see a political integration; but let us start at the beginning.
Better to wait after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
It was two years ago, he was going wrong: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, it was a provocative in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderate was unique-not under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is implemented to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng - chang, who has served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is in the process of doing its best to show that he also can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, on condition that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the public Taiwanese that his party has an "alternative worthy of trust" in relation to the hasty approach of Mr. Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He has even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will find it hard to choose between its potential candidates.
It is important that the KMT should make introspection yourself.
The assessments of Mr. Ma have been low, despite a dramatic economic growth, the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his cabinet as well as its local offices will be revised.
The good results of the HRP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the approximation is limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
To make the request of a chairman, and people are required to read.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassiste and singer of 26 years harvested in the hand by President Obama to occur during the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a major appointment in the category of "best new artist."
Considering that Spalding is a known very figure on the jazz scene since his album of 2008, "Esperanza," the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards in which an artist must not go out more than three albums before the registration, which establishes the public identity of that artist. "
Its ambitious album of 2010," Chamber Music Society, was certainly a step forward and, given its slightly Kirchberg28 vocal style, his skillful hands of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line dotted Spalding from President Norah Jones storming success in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards taking into account the jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album," a drive on a chilling revigorant of a registration was one of the favorites paramount last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" claviériste John Beasley will be in competition.
Shorty trombone, favourite to the husky voice of the New Orleans and invited frequent "Treme" for HBO, has been honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; who tend strongly towards some merger with albums Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognition in the general together; in competition with the rich chamber - jazz Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose album "Pathways" of its live octet's was an example of the democratic hand of this bassiste as group leader.

The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in the running for a reward.
Traditional appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year featuring five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Fost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.

The project of the mosque of Temecula won the approval of the planning commission.
A project to mosque Temecula has received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics have taken to the project by claiming that it was the promotion of terrorism that the traffic jams.
But the commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new centre religious complied with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of people came to support: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you say," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, taking the floor Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a US citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," said.
"They were just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6pm and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people voting for or against the centre, about evenly divided speaking time, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate has continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is more of America," wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the attacks of 11 September 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of the order of 135 families Co-Senior exists without incident in the County of Riverside for years but wanted more space and better than the coldstore it has leased on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque in 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would be a 4.32 site on the road Nicolas hectares two miles to the east of the Lycee Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the bacteria unusual here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life really" foreign ," said Paul Davies C. W. of the State University of Arizona, coauthor of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been seen as essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after having replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report.
The discovery is important in research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize the life, what what life, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss the details of the discovery, has generated, which has not disclosed widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extra-terrestrial life.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organizations may be able to use other elements for 26/97 biochemistry and that the whole" standard "elements, that we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Scientific Research decrease998-1003 and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of a fundamental to another in biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe - Simon of the Institute of Astrologie of NASA, who led the study, has chosen the lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances may be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behaviour really is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the organizations have trouble distinguishing these components separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different that it does not exactly as the phosphorus-based; he got inside and, in some way, the work of our biochemical machine," said Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacterium known under the name of GFAJ -1 and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorus-based, but the fact that it can live with arsenic raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, or elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus-based, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that this could walk.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, the researchers have hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used.
This suggests that there may be other ways to train the life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the research team from Wolfe - Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two exhibition stolen dogs have been recovered in Compton
The two other dogs exhibit on four stolen outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, county sheriffs in Los Angeles announced Thursday.
The four dogs exposure - two akitas and two corgis pembroke Welsh - have disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the truck Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others were found in the late evening Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the Sheriff's Department of Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are good," said Whitmore.
"They are in good form."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what Reyenga and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say" he Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, have not been able to be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They have been met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
The Sheriff's deputies found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a male of 3 years, and Didi, a female 10 months - were safe and sound, announced by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter corgis, Rickard and Peek had planned to show the regional competitions this week, for the account of Japanese dog owners were likely disappeared until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Reding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the national "akc/Eukanuba" championat of Long Beach, where they deliver-and present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions other events planned in the days before the exhibition "akc/Eukanuba," said Peek Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the judgments of the canine exposure tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They often remain in the motels and garent their truck outside, right beside the window of their room.
They have taken three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a terrier Parson Russell and a épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they have left the Akitas and the corgis, the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be more costs.
They have a little opened the windows, so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the truck to 6 hours Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to CBLC again, the restructuring of MGM no longer expects green-lighted final court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM has finally received the go-ahead for anew.
A federal judge in New York bankruptcy, officially praised Thursday the "prepackaged" plan by the creditors that approximately $5 billion in debt would be erased, paving the way to the business of entertainment, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision on Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to refloat under the tutelage of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General of what will be a studio eased.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 to 400 at the outset.
MGM will not emerge really Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not concluded a $500 million credit facility, planned to fund the new operations and MGM productions.
She is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which meets itself to $75 million, and should be funded to mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. has been committed to advise management on how to put its finances since she had no means to pay the interest amounting to 300 million dollars per year.
In the month of August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in re-erection known for his work in Krispy Doughnuts Kreme.
Moelis and itself.30 attempts to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and meet the studio more than 140 creditors have taken much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties have agreed to put the company in sales.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders including none of them was prepared to pay the sum of 2 billion more that creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, he had to 2001.10 while the team of MGM had started work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, has finally been approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fate of bankruptcy in the following weeks, the companies Moelis and itself.30 receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Businesses of Cooper, who had collected 375,000 per month for their services to management of the company, will receive a $4 million " success premium.
Barber and Birnbaum relaunch the production of MGM, who pulled out a single film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that come from 2012.
They also intend to co-financing two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to conclude a separate loan between 265,000,000 and $47,467 $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which holds about 18 percent of MGM debt, has tried to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Toymakers Tech to maintain your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the video game system from Microsoft, Kinect, the two can make a significant dent in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX bicycles to $99 and that a game Kinect cost the same price as 10 cord-wood to skip traditional beads, or about 48 boxes of Play - Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" us and BJ Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more force; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, although there are generally fewer new toys associated with Web sites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more offers.
And toys to button cells are increasing, as well as toys rechargeable batteries.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" us, unless otherwise indicated.
The Sing - - my - jigging (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys of the size of a cochon of India who sing when you 0.13-0.14 a note on the stomach.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows us to deal a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you cannot stop.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by the OMLT Live technology last year, the 14 inches animatronic doll plays rotational games such as Simon Says and can dance lunar thanks to its feet articulated innovative with blocking the wheels.
Children who have essyaé the toy Mickey uses as an instructor of dance while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a backpack filled with maps of quiz designed to transform a ride car correction a car and a filing cabinet in a session with gates.
If you are suspicious when your child takes your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL Fisher-Price ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses a type iTunes system to provide electronic games and books and is equipped with a DS entry for card which allows to post pictures of families.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to train the words in placing online blocks before the time lag, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.

Make a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait of the city as an urban sergeant training in inspecting severely nerve-like expenses, in whispers issuing orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - responsible large public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Keep right!"
"Soyez perçantes!"
Show them, he said, "what beautiful girls!"
Four girls barely past adolescence in white gloves identical, dressed in jackets and pants color olive, stiffened up at attention.
Four pairs of shoes black heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly! Hair attached to the summit by a node removed in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have a functionconscious average," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city has required that all new recruits have a higher degree of study.
Guangdong province has exchanged the grey - green uniforms against a blue supposedly more movement-promoting.
Wuhan, Central China, has replaced the Arlije them - eyes by heavy-fisted:: in 2009, a report has noted that 50 officers surrounded a cart fondness uncontrollable with black eyes, strongly for half an hour, until the colporteur is packing up his business and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation of image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its police in urban street 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police dégrossie a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to attract the eye on this underground urban brigade of China
And because the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these agents are allowed to enforce municipal orders imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the new a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of central Hubei have beaten to death after an observer that he used his mobile phone to film the process to disperse a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for the Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how defeat effectively offenders without issue of blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastèques colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available online by Napster's, shows Chinese inspectors trained to the onslaught of street vendors.
"Chengguan was the government," said last year China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a real cleaning."
Skeptics say that the approach is far.
After the district has spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had real duties or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer appears to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district required of female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must have a size more than the average of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The 26 years is compulsory retirement.
Officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"It is their image that is important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a website quasi government.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, the facial features, etc"
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
The women of Chengguan are as flower vases he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the management office of the district of the city, not endorse this description.
But he noted that the requirements for the loftiness were the common standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the exigeance on the order of facial features.
This means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Admittedly, the disabled or reflected should not apply.
"We cannot allow a person who box or a bossu here serve," said Mr. Zheng.
"It would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrol on the Baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and cheeks pommelées with a finely incurvées mouth.
It does not consider the value of its appearance as sexist, d'Addario said.
"Do you think I air sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a audience.
Xu Yang, his colleague fossettes aged 21 years, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose that their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed major career ambitions than simply hunting vendors in alleyways where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen hawkers who move quickly on foot or bike, trying to sell the most possible rolls or bowls of Tofu prior to the leak.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We have already said several times!," said Ms. Xu while a seller has fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle cart noodles.
The officers describe their functions rather monotonous that difficult.
"This is roughly the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that the female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They may threaten to report violators to their male superiors.
This tends to protect public exhibitions sudden animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens to Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spreading of false rumours that the chengguan officers had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were wounded, 14 vehicles of government has been overthrown or firearms.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of homes in the evening Baoguang, where the female officers patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers seized a motorbike that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the imposing regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was yelling to the scandal.
An iron arm 15 minutes followed before the police, face grim, have found a way to elbow blows to their vehicle and are parties to the motor-cycle and its owner speed.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, remained behind, his badge White returned to hide its name.
As the female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain a cirée image.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of the time, it is the public starts."
Senator Ensign inculperont not prosecutors
Prosecutors of the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case linked to an assistant of a former campaign and its efforts to obtain lobbying work for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday of Senator lawyers.
The decision ended the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was seen as a possible candidate Republican in the presidential election in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case is the big national titles last year and undermine his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign said he was "very pleased" by the decision, result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Counsel for Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the inquiry and that he did not intend to maintain some kind of accusation against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has declined to comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a criminal prohibition federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first disclosed in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer in a campaign to Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funding to find work for Mr. Hampton and, secondly, he defended their rights after they have committed Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law to lobby his former employer or the Senate in its entirety.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the case, seems in conflict with the so-called ban of the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there is a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violations of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the department has refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a certain number of high-level cashed setback by his section of the public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high ranking government officials can now assumes the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign main lawyer, said in an interview that he had received Monday a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice and followed the next day, saying that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
The team of lawyers to Mr. Ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a news release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that he had made to the public prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission has decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint independent by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of 96.000 per the parents of Mr. Ensign Hampton violated the federal election law.
The electoral commission has said that it was not enough evidence to prove that the money was everything except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An Email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company has welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff to Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelait" the Department of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign has also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer Nevada, Allegiant Air, and it has asked the Secretary of Transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after having committed Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case have surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he had the intention to seek a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped the Ethics Committee quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and would end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The appeal of Cheshire will expose to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the process of typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were consigning all minutes of testimony horrific reports via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the trial largely followed Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the family Cheshire, in Connecticut, should lead to a formal end where the judge would impose the death penalty, passed by the board.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already submit evidence to the court outlining appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years.
This is provocative, it is that the intense stories on the trial - as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists of Twitter - have created an "atmosphere of circus," if widespread and instant EMTNS with incendiary details that the board has been badly affected by the passions of the public.
The request could push the appellate judges to debate on the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"I have experience at this trial and I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, laconiquement rejected the claims last week in the judgment, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board would have been animated by the passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeal courts have recognized for decades that the media coverage of WellKnown case may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966 landmark, the Supreme Court of the United States quashed the conviction of a Cleveland osteopaths, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was an "atmosphere of carnival at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television and the film "the fugitive's."
Some lawyers have said that the appeal courts to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be required to manage the means of communication courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and has written a report according to which it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is one of many described by counsel for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years, which delays the execution.
The defence lawyers claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when the judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors showing grisly photos of criminal scenes at the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they had been horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke - Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years.
The defence lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge was unjustly expelled one juror, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual decision to bring the board to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They have maintained that the computer media to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily tweets scuffle media, cameras and journalists to the thecourthouse," wrote the lawyers, "looked like nothing of what was seen here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the cover of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists have said that the statement, according to which the new instant were more inflammatory challenge releases more slowly, was a luddiste that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trial.
But some lawyers have said that the appeal courts étaitent often attracted by the arguments that the technological and social change requires adaptation by the courts.
Counsel for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they are a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard due to media coverage of the trial and they indicated that they invoqueraient the need for new rules for the new media.
"This affair," wrote they ," represents Sheppard v.. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can bring the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and the negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory time before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no breakthrough on the key issues that must be dealt with during the "lame duck" session.
But obviously, there are at least had a polite discussion on the differences of the two parties as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points. Contentless rating supporter.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Committee on the deficit has been equally civilized president, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide, but which, however, still divides the members.
It is barely sufficient to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and test for signs of cooperation and compromise mutual, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent comments from participants have unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or the rights, the two parties remain miles of distance.
However, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now on the side of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are causing partisan passions, and then they estomptent.
This is good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, the Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is conceivable on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the wealthy, while denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, more optimism hangs on a possible agreement on the questions raised during the session on the "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But official William Galston put it, of the Brookings Institution, warns that a successful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "duck" session will lead not necessarily a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead of this, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be made will be, the psychology in the short term will be one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism widely shared that civility would lead to a genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow - boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electors present at the tea that have contributed to its development.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are now clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Committee of the deficit that include reforming the tax code and to increase certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reduce spending.
The co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, by themselves, imposed the issue of the deficit on the agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have had difficulty in achieving this number.
The greatest resistance are still among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that there is on tax issues, at least today, few grounds or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come the next year in the form of clashes supporters, given that the Republicans assail Obama in terms of budget, tax and health care; then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What is the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely shown that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, when the two parties will attentively observe public reaction.
Those who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But this would be an optimistic point of view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid 1990s and there seems to be more ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of the two parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find an accommodation on the issues that divide again.
American disclosed documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and put up to the Kremlin part of bribes and money that it collects, said the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service realize huge racketeering that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said that.
They collect the money not only legitimate businesses, but also of organized crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share as the money passes to the top of the scale.
The note of service, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was mailed Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The score is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there has since been few traces of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and it has won several defamation trial on these charges.
In September, he said that a Russian TV channel, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is to throw, it is anything."
The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in a record of Embassy; and it is incredible to conceive that this would be diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to name the "dysfunctional" and to say that the government functioned more as a kleptocratie that a government ," according to the note to the embassy.
"The criminals enjoy a" krysha " (the term used in the world criminal/the mafia which means literally" roof " protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, and throughout the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in the Moscow criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB and the MVD and militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminals fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB breaststroke money larger companies and that the police ciblent small.
A source, he said that, "explained that business owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime), because not only, they have more weapons, more resources and more power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"This is the reason why the application for protection by the criminal gangs is not as high."
The memo noted that, although the collection of the money is extended, protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to an arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business shut down under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned several times the fight against corruption but he admitted the little progress.
The note of the embassy sends reports showing men who bring suitcases, probably met money, up to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the think tank Indem " of Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it is not in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said that corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption, to the whole of Russia, to more than $300 billion per year.
The country has been ranked 154e in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked the least corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the US Embassy, which was carried out yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be faulted, to a certain extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN Larry King, Putin has hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and has reacted with anger to the remarks that US diplomats had disclosed to the appellant Batman and bringing Medvedev Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, important domestic policy in this country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly lit with decrepit decommissioned concrete walls of the secondary school of Anlong Veng non-quality, the Director has mentioned the man who had built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here likes Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader, and he was concerned about her people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42-years-old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge northwest of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally challenged Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled the victims to respond publicly to the people who had participated in the scheme.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of his former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court jointly run with the United Nations, made its first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known under the name "Duch."
Before this evolution of the situation, the anxiety has increased with veterans of the Khmer Rouge Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wishes to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurgency that has lasted until the last movements go in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary heading guerrilla base located in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN has led to the first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of combatants Khmer Rouge began defecting to the government, culminating with the capitulations Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most veterans Khmer Rouge have sunk in abject poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite officers Khmer Rouge kept their positions of local leader in exchange for having tabled the weapons, it is not qualified farmers low rank and file.
"These people have benefited little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for justice and reconciliation which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are saturated with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were reared in a context where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55 years old, who has joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving in 1998 as poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the judgment of Nuon Chea president Khieu Samphan Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The mandate of the tribunal is to judge the senior leaders and the main responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said if he continued beyond these four cases.
It alonger to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey in the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she said researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of workers forced would have found the death.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the grass parched, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court, she said, she had refused to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," d'Addario said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been defection of the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also warned repeatedly that instability would happen if the court continued several suspects, although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But confront the past is everything that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
"The Khmer under reconciliation is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "a history of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It has distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to textbooks history of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young Anlong Veng are only a few details on the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the complex and difficult process of reconciliation, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road, invaded by weeds and littered with plastic bags, led to a black soot rectangle, covered in a rusty tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Sothea Nuom, aged 31 years, mobile telephone saleswoman roadside, said she knew little about the man who has been cremated at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go to pray, she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she has planned to walk to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where it would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of the campaign of President Obama to secure the nuclear materials in the world
The agreement was disclosed in a news release spouse published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to convince the Belarus-EU to renounce the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials have said in the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate CDN$188 books of the weapons-grade uranium from a research centre of Belarus.
This has opened the way to an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the approximately 500 books, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, held at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it has been profitable VEEP invitation to the former Soviet republic in the wake of the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Summit of 2012 Nuclear Security Summit of security."
"This proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group of promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant, important" conducted by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all nuclear materials vulnerable across the world in the coming four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the summit on Obama's nuclear security, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, has said that the nation will never renounce its uranium.
"We kept of highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the weapons-grade uranium and the low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Lukashenko.
"It is our product... we will not produce dirty bombs, and we will not sell to anyone."
"We will use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus is closer to the United States a few months; however, Préspa of interest to reach an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus, in October, has been particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, said officials.
He has been charged on a special train has travelled more than 1,300 miles up to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organisation have been implemented in order to strengthen the trust," leading to the agreement signed by President Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Menace world.
According to the estimates of the James Martin Center of Nonprolifération Study, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and the development of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has no objection to the CIA flights
The government has no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantánamo direction means of Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (ZCCM's) by Wikileaks daily El País, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of the time, María Teresa Fernàndez de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive is advised to "pouvoir' show that they exercised proper vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain."
In June 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, held a meeting between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernàndez Vega.
The Vice-President has acknowledged that the report of the Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and stressed the fact that Spain had nothing to hide.
"The Vega said that Spain has no objection in relation to intelligence flights above the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "to them-you," excusez-moi Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Department of Externe this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, has reported to the Spanish ambassador that the Executive "wanted to give this matter the mindscape lowest-possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
In turn, in the month of January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González was sent to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any element denouncing any sensitive information," said the Embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States have shown even their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for INC's declassified information o the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigator will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between Governments," regret Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of Internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider adequate," he had given instructions to its staff "that they avoid the comments of an overheated rhetoric, trying to declined temperature."
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"In spite of its general orientation pro-American, our experience suggests that PP certainly will benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations are negative consequences for the US Government," noted.

The messages come from 2008.

But by the content of its communications, we hear that their idyll is fractured, they are separated.
In the month of March 2008 it is in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and offended for the fact that I've come to work."
"When I told him, this was a good thing, but of course, it is now account of what it means to be the day with the child and not have the freedom to do what it wants."

In the month of May, it speaks of the returned to his village: "This week I am going, but I'll only until 19, because the 20 I must submit to a position of work to do not lose."

In the month of July, there is another post-exhibition.

"Terror in the Galician (épigraphe) ."
The last man who has lived with it, ears, declares its regret to feel guilty.
He does not think that everything was past that she had not conté the fact that she was single mother.
Mónica came yesterday in the provincial prison Palma, from the centre of Minorca judicial detainees.
The lawyer of office, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not recall how the facts were past, "and she did not intend to do harm to the minor."
Before she confessed to drowning in the bathtub Césars and filed his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the SGP would lose 9
With the results of 18 - N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase of votes and Members recorded in the last elections autonomous Catalan PP has already referred the general because, even if there is progress or not, are more than positive prospects, because the number of votes that this training gets in these comices normally twice it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan received 610.473 votes in the general in 2008, while the autonomous, they had obtained 316.222 in 2006.
On Sunday, the CPP has received 384.091 votes.
If it maintains this upward trend, of a PP CSP voting diversion and retention of the electorate, analysts of this training have calculated the fact that, if there would be general elections, the CPP could from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress, while CiU would also benefit from four (now 10) and SGP would lose no more or less than 9 Members (25).
These calcules would see that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while LCI left a Member or would benefit.
But if the election agenda continues, the more next appointment would be held in May of 2011 for the municipal comices, where the popular may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations who manipulates the higher - 661 million budget for 2011 euros-.
Both nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that CSP could lose the Lérida rights5 Barcelona, Tarragona, Gerona, where the Socialists would most the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and LCI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would be fanciful that this training loses its representation in the town hall in Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Ballesteros Felix EPP-ED's.
In Lérida, the PP has registered only a difference of 500 votes from CSP, including the mayor, Ros Àngel, maintains very good relations with Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
The popular reported progress in other major municipes as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
The seven inmates in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian detained by agents of the Commissioner General of Police Information Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that led from Thailand, facilitated Al Qaeda passports to different groups, among which "the Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil earthshine (LTTE) and" Laskar e Taiba " (Let), the latter being the author of the Mumbai attacks which have caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave great importance to these investigations, to ensure the fact that with "Operation Kampai" had "been stupidity" the apparatus of falsification Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the unit, in the two years in which it has been active in Catalonia, has been sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the galaxy criminalstructure Al Qaeda for its "veterans" can move the European borders and other Western countries with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is only that the jihadist network was keen operative in Europe, it is for this reason that in the investigations have participated in the Thai services, other police units European, that is why in the territory of the European Union it could be days blows similar to that recorded the night of Tuesday happened in Barcelona.
In coordination with the Pakistani Junaid (was detained this operation Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand has conducted another, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Butt Ehsan and Thailand's Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was those heading for Bangkok the cell established in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part was hit in 2009 - the passports were mainly tourists who meet the conditions marked by the appointed "World Islamic Front."
That is, to say the documents should be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of estampées several years and without visas.
The investigators stress that until now it has found no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Mumbai, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it must remember the fact that a few days before that attack, Catalonia was sent through an agency transfers a few miles of dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that have been used by the integral from "commando" that killed 106 people.
The Police this--as literature.
PP ask Mas that it suspend the tax complicity
The leader of EIP, Alicia Sànchez - Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas its conditions to support his investiture as President of the Generalitat, identical to those outlined during the campaign and which boil down to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo adventures - separatists as economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to raise half of its mandate.
The Chair of the popular Catalan arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 MEPs in the elections on Sunday, more than enough to be love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training that will have opposition abstaining in the voting for the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are key Catalan.
And in relation to the president of the PP, to support a relevait "it should eliminate all secessionists and separatists speech," and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit to referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make thin the political apparatus autonomic administration very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will the PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors MONTSERRAT.
Mas met already with Joaquim Nadal (CSP) - which has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (LCI) and today it will with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says that the dead have not been due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their Ien night has killed more than 11 elderly
Officials of the geriatric The Caritat Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly which he was responsible in the meantime there has worked.
The Director of the residence, Joan Sala, came accompanied by the lawyer for the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the leaders processuelle situation."
And part of the social discredited that the entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the Ien night, the great threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation already calculated that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from this day has not ceased to kill.
The judge said in sentencing that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of Geriatric Care it suspected that in many cases outlined no doctor personally died but, given the age and the illness of patients, the Formalités was held by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, denied categorically yesterday this situation and noted that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there was only a reckless index of any person that is Neben."
The person already dubbed as "the Angel of Death" said Monday 11 murders and explained that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it has caused the death by injecting a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedatives 1..2..3.
The Director of The Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control access to the staff of the centre for medicine.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in its desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill.
But the laboratory analyses clarify if Vila not longerlived by saying that he has sought for its first victims less cruel death or otherwise it has burned inside laundry giving as it has already admitted that he has done with the three women that he killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night Ien, the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of greater than the number and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having committed with success eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available to the courts to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors are reacting sharply yesterday to the threat of yesterday Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
DIFFERENTIALS peripheral have closed in the strength and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of ECB yourself and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a timestretched signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it collapses, it will recover, but motivated by fencing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor takes to lose the fear.
There was a month ago, ECB was quoted today to withdraw liquidity measures and he will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the purchase plan because of its inefficiency of public debt and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity to term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that it extends the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the auction quarterly access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until the month of June.
We hope that we will continue with the program to purchase obligations and that it gives the signal to intensify.
If they do not globalization-triggered expectations, they will overturn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help!
During their meeting in the month of May in which they have said that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they have collapsed markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought much, by causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the auction of bankdrafts to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to $750 million to 1.49% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points in the curve, and clearly reflect a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland was published figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland the hole.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short term and 15,000 potential and they have a delay until February to secure private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not have detected the problem in July with the trial of stress, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government must obtain parliamentary approval for his new budget, and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in the home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to relax the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president has had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers approve Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment ring to the gills of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market has suffered the 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today there is an auction - key to a requirement to three years will be bénéficiée by Trichet, therefore we hope that it would solve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For a Plan Assistance of Spain would be a auto-immolation.
They would provide a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple compared to March, types very expensive and they cut access to markets indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be the wife of Césars, "to be, the Low-Inflation."
Courage, we can get out!
The president of Eulen dispute his son requested by the Board of Sicilia Vega
The storm does not stop in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, argue, as it considers "08036 law," the judicial council of El Enebro the 16th, requested by five of her seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take the management bodies of the incumbent Bodegas Vega Sicilia firm.
David Alvarez and his son Jesus David and María José give legal battery for the new chapter in their dispute for control of a share of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for the companies would not be willing to cede in their dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of her seven sons who were appointed administrators in the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year that the challenge is recorded in the Register of Trade and.
The judicial council of El Enebro, convened by the Commercial Magistrat for the next 16 Issue 2 of Madrid, has opened new tonnerres box in the family Álvarez.
The salt-tolerance judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate use career-seekers his five sons to try, processuelle pettifoggery through fraud clearly the Act and by abusing the law, validate and correct the assembly radically zero 18 January," according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting was held, be challenged in considering that it is "no right."
The same players, who maintain a discreet silence, have tried without success that the magistrate convenes a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a 1858-1942 company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services would like to ask the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the protocols familiar.
This case is the question of substance that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of challenge for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull treet entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of speed has been marked by the surprise and success.
In a first time, nobody has taken into account the options for a new stable who had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the final phase of the championship they have all backed the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without Arlije skill as a pilot of the champion, the German of goaltender Sebastian Vette, the capacity of the Renault engine which drives his car in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put the hands of Red Bull for Tran­sformin­g in a team winner.
It is actually a powerful software simulation process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far away from the high automobilistique competition.
Appointed, this powerful computer instrument was used to create the fabricantes assembly chains throughout the world, power stations, the instruments of high precision.
The goal is COUNCIL., accurately simulate the product or process prior to build a real way, avoiding -Defects and avoidable costs.
Has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or most famous vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this instrument computer in its plant in Formula1 led Red Bull to create and execute "in few hours, almost in real time," the amendments, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explained that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team work today 180 young professionals of high qualifications, equipped with powerful computers analyze and plan any changes to the cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that the software is able to analyse and improve all elements of the cars of Red Bull except for the engine, which is responsibility of Renault.
It amends the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes may move from the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and high-tech autoclaves.
As a single limitation of this madness of technology development there is the amount of $40 million that each team of Formula1 can spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has ADFSI high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality to 50 kilometres of London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty 580 people, presented herein two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula1 of Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the huge technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has places in the service of its participation in the channels-a, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero visibility.
Steve Nevey, the director of the plant technology, said that there was five years ago you could say that the progress of R + D in the case of cars racing brought the 50% of victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents the 85% of success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the value added.
Nevey says the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 stores own with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) was inaugurated in Barcelona its first store exclusive in collaboration with its associated Pont Reyes.
This will be the first network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for two years.
The company accounted for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand sales dealer centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, vice-president of HP Spain, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which it is 30 years that it works.
The American group has prepared a plan to implement 200 points of sale of brand in Europe in 2013, strategy which includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona is the third.
Herrero did not reveal the next possible stores, even if it has admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of MH personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the implementation of stores is always the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture stores (with products that can be touched an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of insti-tutional claims "improve service to clients and to SMEs in the purchase, assistance, the post sale and even the packaging."
The store Barcelona includes an area with a pilot pioneer at global level that solves the problems of HP's computer equipment as collateral.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"For example, in 10 minutes we can solve the problems that can often take two days."
"This system is designed specifically for the MPEs and users, as the major airlines have already technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell is betting on " voler' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, think 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse in margins of interests, that it will try to compensate partially with incréments committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expect strategized a million customers in three years, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit in the future three years and be able to survive in an economic environment very complicated.
The bank will march in 2011 a new management plan that will be going labilité to three years.
The objective, to survive without need to resort to FROB public subsidies, is to gain market rating by the capture of a million new customers - 700,000 if you deducted those who can break the bank - his great task to accomplish, because so far the bank had marred more SMEs and companies that the particular customer.
This year he picked up 250,000 customers and 50,000 companies.
His rating producer-specific market is 3.5%, while the companies it exceeds the 10%.
Another base of the 20112013 plan is a gamble on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the goal of cost reduction, including the provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks dare now to set goals and make public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise its plan this year Optima, establishes there was four years ago, although originally the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further year.
Clients who leave escape the coffers of savings will be its main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by FIPA, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be a year "difficult and overwhelming."
The executive, in fact, believe that the exit of the crisis in Spain " will be slow.
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted he says.
And even if he thinks that the war liabilities - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and funds pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity move already in the price of credit to offset the drop in margins.
"The liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We do not have tight the tap, but DIFFERENTIALS are highest," acknowledged Guardiola.
BANESTO has already given orders to its network of limiting the long-term credit and increase the price of differentials' - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The plan of Sabadell based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of achieving corporate operations.
This is not in vain that it ensures that Spain "will seek bigger size."
"Any move next year," said Danesh.
He said that the needs of capital "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the diversion of funds in the case of new recapitalization.
After having ensured that Sabadell can survive the closing time of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that few banking 5.2.48 already as a new liquidity crisis.
He noted that you cannot issue, but the opposite of what happened in June, the short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which lessens the crisis.
ECSC-funded rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among debtrelated
The Director General of ECSC-funded, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of aCan savings and insisted again on the speed with which implements the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings funds began, there have been several entities which have ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they are used for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Confederation Spaniard Caisses Épargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that the greater part of mergers has been conducted, we cannot say that the inclusion of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, the adjustments."
"Most was done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 so--should 13 or 14, but all major processes have been made already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who has worked a lot in this operation, too," said the leader.
In the statements Dirigeants and Exécutifs during a breakfast meeting of the Association of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is "the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way that it is in the time that was set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé says.
"The passage of 45 aCan with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% that they are much larger to comply with Basel," said Danesh.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of relatively happy about the slowness of the process" that shows "a lack of sérosité and meaning" because "what the Bank of Spain is to remind you that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of ECSC-funded, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world and it has allocated to the people who put into doubt a "lack of knowledge."
The leader said that given the current economic conditions, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and unions-from savings, a system which has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the highest speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector is well from stress tests that ECB was carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but he sets the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have caused a government response doble.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of the private placement or removal of 426 euros of aid to the unemployed professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of state Loteries.
Another, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president Felipe González, unites the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel in relation to its responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How are we to interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its policy communicative.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which angered with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
The European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible outflow of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the southern abandon the currency area.
The second, the recovery of Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines on countries which, possible suspension of payments violate them and extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and so long as it is, therefore, now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission technique deficits, the German Government has invented constitutional reform to prevent from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that we had to do (plans for fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and that its European partners, ci- includes France, practised.
The second centre-européen of the country kicked when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From this time she has been the subject of a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expressed again a clear position, in calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and force 28 private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly watered down, has been approved and, the following month, we should attend the process of reform of the EU to possible these measures from 2013.
Germany drew a red line that it does not cross.
And she said all that, even though now we must take measures with which it may not be too agree, from this date there former functioning of the euro would be finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries which contravene the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to said termination payments and, in this case, the private sector also bear a party costs.
Germany says that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and external balances.
An alternative based on the debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who has chaired the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The development is clear.
And it would be wrong to not hear.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what it must not do in these circumstances is to fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence leave happen to us greater peace.
And that we know to take the opportunity that we have been given until spring of 2013.
It appears that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large companies and the announcement yesterday of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it has opened the way for the thesis that there must be of the order in the home.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is there, and they do not seem to move.
And among the possibilities that considering, we cannot exclude that to abandon a monetary area loaded with too few serious countries.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that we had been warned.
Sport and the law fraud
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the desire to escape a sanction.
EVICTION played in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused much ink on the sports nature of such behaviour and if the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before finishing the game RARELY (that their team clearly), the two players have deliberately lost the time when they have committed mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will be leader of his group, the two players make regulatory enforcement during the next game of the dam match against Auxerre and can pass without paperboards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has punished the coach of the team with two games, José Mourinho and various are economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, otherwise rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is party of the ethos, written rules, but followed, this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case related to the fact that this has had a team of the entity as protagonist's Real Madrid (which in its anthem poster the nobility and honor and which in the past occasions was fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode of history inflated histrionique technician and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behaviour not specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if with these actions is a fraud law, because, in effect, they are respectful actions with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
A property that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, something that with these actions has not been endangers, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of those goods which refers to the proper game is avoid the team players offenders enjoys an unfair way contrary to the team, which is not the case.
However, the action of players from the Real Madrid paradox is that it does not accept what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has specifically tried to be the most obvious possible to receive the criminalization of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and they have accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that the offenders get errors well-intentioned examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that we are not in a situation of disadvantage to rival and does an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action involves the letting their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cardboards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of ambiguity, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and otherwise, with this action the players perform a match penalty and spend in the second round of paperboards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cardboards occurs with a less than in the first round.
So, climb the ladder, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of strategic decisions that promote the advantage of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the sanction (this would be a clear cases of fraud the law), m otherwise they have chosen the time in which they are subject to it.
They have taken a strategic decision without defeat the penalty or flee this.
Even if the border between engineering and fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think that there has been a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, seems due to two factors: because there were two self Deportations and because of the way to convey the Director for the cause.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
PK-based offensive to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in CIs'
The dictatorship of the timetable is concentrating this year a spate of bookings for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, when December sometimes come back dinner before the Christmas groups which continue to be the ball of oxygen for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive you adjusted prices in order to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros dinners or lunches, coincide businesspeople and interviewed sector associations.
To complete complicate the accounting, the timing of this year (such as the night of New Year's Eve falls Friday) has concentrated applications in the week of 13 December, as result so far an avalanche of dinners bookings days peak (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize paying their own pockets.
No matter what is the economic situation, they ask all price battle, confirms the president of Gremi of Barcelona, Gaietà Restauració Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, do not dare to predict how will the celebrations this month.
"People jusque much before booking."
"They want to get out but they pay much attention to the price," he says.
The matter will go well "for those who provide quality affordable and with a good service," he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to descend a level with the crisis, so that the tranche around EUR 25 became majority in the application.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre is noted the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boom in applications for the world--that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conditions, with complete forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of more powerful, Andilana, with 16 institutions in the city (Hostal Rita, Market, The Fonda and others), the timetable has assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of the month of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices in the past year, with menus for all tastes of $19.95 to 30 euros," detailing they.
Grup year, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local, remains optimistic after detected a billing growth since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for the Christmas.
Sources of group noted that the 18 will be a day - active in groups of friends who celebrate in advance of the holiday season.
In their six menuing group they have added to the noël, with 30 euros or more as famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demand more details, such as Catalan wines made according to the method 'Champagne-type' - ' cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite new employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
The share of employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Divertissement), its vice-president, Enric Gomà says in the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "lively," even if the "maximum" US$3.37 clients.
This is true, the hope as regards the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern to the United States
Islamabad product of atomic weapons to "a faster pace than any other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of United States filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
The details illuminating and flavorful that offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of diplomatic representatives North American accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "declined" and that the unstable Asiatic country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make it difficult destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The close proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials that the rumour and the vulnerability of the transportation of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs are considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, such as proliférant and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has staff with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; given the decline of cultural and educational levels, the extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who worked in the nuclear or missile programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Department of Russian Externes during a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is cooperation increasingly reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level Pakistani production of nuclear armas.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which has characterized as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for the Southern Asia, noted that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also request to Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, whether understand "very clearly" in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support for terrorist groups."
The head hunting Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to track the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it datte of 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with filtration last more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how contacted. Mr. Assange."
The 20 police international headquarters in Lyon (France) has driven the demand of Sweden, but it has not made public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received indication to identify or locate Assange "for provisionnelle arrest and extradition."
Although UN-organ may not give the order to arrest of a person affected by a red alert, many among the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a way for the arrest - that the national police corps must achieve, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where you think that Assange is.
The movement has outraged lawyers to Assange, who yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has shown by video conference to answer questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also remind us that Assange has sought and obtained the permit to get out of Sweden the prosecutor in his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world seeks - and Australia mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown location, but it is not silent.
On Monday he gave from an unknown location an interview with the Director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he demanded the resignation of the Secretary of the State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that it has been responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they épient to the UN by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" demand of resignation.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a guy with a Web page should look," said Danesh for CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a high responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The Spokespersons' test of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, Congressman from January will chair the National Security Committee in the House Lowertown has asked the Department of State that he is studying the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate its funds and continue to any person who provide contributions or assistance."
Went further Tom Flanagan, an advisor to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who was back on its statements after having said that Assange will "be murdered."
"Obama should transform the goal and use a plane without crew or something similar.
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone who is in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," said Danesh for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks at the HassleFree Carod
The Republican leader will give the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the system of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for resolving the internal revolt umpteenth inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware of the fact that the threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted that the liar and that it cannot give him headaches that he had with other common extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will win its new criticism with winks eye which allow it to shield municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
The ballot papers, not in your hand.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote of criminalising the president, they can do without any fear retaliation.
In fact, the head of is-done wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews that he would not consider ratified with half a vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that an outcome "to the Bulgarian" would not be right either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than put its position to provision of the militancy, a gesture that is not true when Puigcercós control body between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will accept with the executive a road map until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of re-sourcing strategic document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of it to plan the congress in the fall of 2011, what leaders see as a vicechair.
The leader of ERC admitted that "many" affects the stability and that its goal is that once and for all the organization is able to wash his laundry room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Huguet EPP-ED's has signed in his blog result is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if was done.
And it has listed five, including Hestresses two.
The first, "regeneration" executive for it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures come from the Carod sector.
The second may be the character of great new.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes allowing the achievement of delegates elected Congress through 18.3.2008.
Finish with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has fought already in this direction in the last two conventions.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 has charged the direction of revising the model assembly in a specific reform Congress statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of recent years recommended not address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good for the resume and the close forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of this country in the COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce up to 2020 between 40 and 45% of greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer of reduced between 40 and 45% of greenhouse gas emissions before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of this country to the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16è Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention of the United Nations on the Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and redeploy its industry.
In fact, explained to me, the last four years his country has inverti 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it has clearly stated that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity; construction of institutions and support for pilot programs.
It has recorded progress in all these areas, ci- includes the approval, the last year, a new Energy Act, which recognizes the 993-1351 objectives regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases, said Danesh.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with the government and local to achieve the objectives of saving energy, efficient use of energy and emission reduction.
In addition, said Danesh multi-year plans, there are various ongoing or completed, both funded by the Chinese government as by the governments of other countries.
For example, said Danesh, the Efficiente Program to Use of Energy, which has been implemented during the past five years and which has received investments of the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change incandescent lamps with energy-efficient lamps and another mitigation and adaptation, darstellen says.
At the same table, Martin Krol, advisor of the government of this country in relation to climate change, has ensured that China's efforts have been larger what we believe.
For example, has exposed says, the emission per capita of greenhouse gases in China is three tonnes per person, while the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historic contribution to the contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the past five years and expects to make another similar to 2020, said Danesh.

The national leader of Pilier paniste the former leader has detailed that the right to apply to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
The national Pilier leader, Césars Nava Vàzquez has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former leader paniste has the right to apply to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
In the interview prior to the protest Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Commission Order of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to apply, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Commission Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision in a competent body," noted Danesh.
On the other hand, he was informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vàzquez was convinced of the fact that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where we should elect a successor.
"It (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, this has been an approach for the local elections has been successful and has achieved its goal," said Danesh.
The paniste leader has mentioned that Pilier is supported by 71 years of dialogue, why we do not fear internal competition; on the contrary "we relish and is stronger," said Danesh.
He said that without doubt the board knew-and élégir/the best leader/e Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the notes "to the person determined by the Board."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five."
It is expected that the restimulating recorded by the party in the elections of July 4, will be jusque to the next dispute, even if "this is not the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is to accompany the governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there is "a lot of hopes, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of the expectations."
When asked about the criticism of PRI against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during its four years of government, Césars Nava asked priistes to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari administrations.
"If the PRI think that the governments of Zedillo Salinas were better than those of Fox Calderón; that they begin to defend; that they emerge from" crib, " he said.
He said that the owner of the federal executive can make expressions such as those he has done in his speech 40-49-year-olds in the audience, because there is no gag in the country, and less still of censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter legislation for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, is quiet senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté the US president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today to national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, is quiet senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains opened a poof link with a broader document that asks the public to contact immediately the senators, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that they hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after Republicans 42 senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation and if the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush government funding to continue.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the Republican Senators 42, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of New START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the Republican blocking the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confidant that once the tax problem is resolved we will be able to set a agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think that we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we need to solve this problem tax before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that it was going to request a "vote of closure of the debate" for the Dream Act, why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be passed from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be the next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or Act of Rêve American would legalise 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years, they remained in the country the past five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, why they require support from a large number of Republicans, in moments of partisan organizations project protagonists intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority which supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that it would vote against and only a Republican has expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the votes of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans there Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator exleast George Lemieux, of Florida, who has completed the mandate known Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they would not support another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported John McCain, has not defined its position until now.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the Dream Act are the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With the literature puts his finger on the wound
The second phase of the Plaisirs of the language has been a walk-about in which the participants flaunted the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? That hopes of me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second phase of the Plaisirs language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and who once used the subtitle of his question (for another show the roundtable was dedicated to the Sexe in the language, said she says).
The finger on the wound ..." we are in the embarrassment" slowly, launched the Argentine writer in public, the majority of young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderate Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa's in the first person as protagonist's seeking what is the "scourge," it is a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative line.
The infectious diseases it fate convinced: "Patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologue cut the breathe-you in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst complaining that reveals the mystery: "The wound is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist's soupirât relieved and concluded: "On the wound I only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with the two.
The Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a beautiful narrative that he titled Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not nombré but at a given moment is discovered.
With overtones of magical realism, it speaks of a famous ensorceleuse affecting clouds, was to return people who were gone far or réparait virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the great new which has had its own columnists from the outset and Laurie Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of the conquerors capitans narratives.
"Cervantes we invented all (the writers) was mocking false witnesses who were in the stories presented as real, but a aitre could never have conté the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the modesty."
Nevertheless, said says, "the crazies and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converge with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction reached its peak.
We call this the " tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that it is the story."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table The must on the wound.
The Cubaine - Puerto Rico puts the sien on the great scourge of social violence that his country is going through - and Latin America sharing- product of the trafique disputes and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, poetry good good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not obviously premeditated," said she says, after just reality and communication dimension of the commitment of the literature is between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero stressed "this is the scourge of the writer committed."
It considered that in a world that lives in high speed also concern the intellectual habits and control consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every assertion there was a small and behind every Denies there is a small yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and be the masters of the reality, we must qualify: and nuance means a lot of time to put the finger on the wound and disturb the people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in black and white, ideas established and without nuance and joy-riding also powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final he had in his career ups and downs, but it has managed to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna, Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles competing, marked by their technicians, who find a sharp contrast between them by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final, it has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine eventually console themselves with the medal of Deputy champion, he remained a step behind the winners and Notch-1 with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The strategist's santiste came to his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he was keen the reins of Morelia with which it has lost with an overall score of 4 - 2 against; later, in the 2003 Clôture also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3 - 1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 200th Anniversary Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered another setback, because his team has done an equal match 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he obtained an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to win the title and eventually three of its players have missed 11 metres and it has suffered the leapers result of 4 - 3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey-based, his rival in the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he tries to break the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I will get the title, but what I have mentioned before is more important," said the helmsman when asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers a lot of the final last, of which it ensures that he has learned a lot, "the single lesson can be learned is that until the arbitrator master whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which is not concerned, because it entrusts his players: "We never seeks to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we that we prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a wrong turn, sometimes are the emotions or anxiety to keep the title between our hands, hands we escaped, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that is not in this situation."
ROMANO now has the opportunity to be a technician deputy champion and taste the glory offered by the titles for the first time.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The space agency of the United States has cited the press tomorrow to make a discovery that will impact on research of living in space.
The National Aeronautics Administration and Space (NASA) of the United States will report tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologique discovery, which could proves the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.

The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in ambient hostile-and that was uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, who lives in an ambient that was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsénique.
In any form, the creature uses the arsénique as a way of living and the ability we believe that a similar life could exist on other planets that are not our atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologistes, if these organizations use the arsénique in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate the géobiologie Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), under the prospect of that chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.

14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in economy.?, Wednesday, in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, predominantly in places that would have been used in the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two leaders alleged, two men from Sherbrooke this network.
Those arrested had to appear in court on Sherbrooke in the hours after their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place in the wake of a lengthy investigation, which lasted nearly a year.
"This is the information received from the public which enabled us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the regional survey module of the economy.? of the Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and police Régie's Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration will continue without any problem
The bill of conservatives who, according to the government, should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will clearly be beaten while the three opposition parties have indicated Wednesday that they could not support.
"I am strongly supports on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the holding of the caucus meeting.
The liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to a year any person from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we shall see what the government will," said Mr. Duceppe.
The immigration NDP critic, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism of the other side of the hand that his party is not sufficiently strong for illegal immigrants.
"The NDP agree to take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, Bill 35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill because it takes the Conservatives to refugees and imprisoning the children for at least a year," said Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and who treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect that Canada take firm measures," responded the Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which would have been able to lead the country to elections if its rejection.
A Conservative told the QMI Agency, however, that the government would ask for a vote so that every Member who will then explain to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York in this matter as soon as January.
The city has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Tuesday has surprised many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police from Quebec, on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
No need for the péquiste criticism in public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, describes as this-on "rabbit stepped out of a hat" and "bricolée solution on the corner of a table."
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the result when we will announce, merely says to say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public inquiry.
"Mr Charest insists on not wanting to create this committee of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a committee of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, it suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," 16-17-year-olds says.
It believes that Quebec could give the Auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing it to force people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent squad is not the only project in the government's Charest paperboards.
Quebec would seek also to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would be the prosecutor Marteau of the operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson, is working on some amendments relating to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit the motorcycle groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently passed the Act on the gangsterism.

These eco-sponsor should be added to the melting of the snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is concern the overflow of several rivers.
Flood alert warnings have been issued Wednesday evening by the civil Quebec Shépaghé studies for the rivers and the Achigan, Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentians, and Chêne in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has caused the overflow of some lakes, Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as Rawdon.
Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was swept away because of heavy rain.
Ten homes had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Ottawa, the overflow of lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil safety remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Annik découvert, advisor in security.
The Centre for flood of Quebec has issued warnings Wednesday of heavy flooding in several rivers, including Départment, L'Assomption, studies, the Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamé
The radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards (SNAB) for controversial remarks on social assistance and the Haitians and rude language on-air.
The SNAB judge that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI FM 98.1 had the right to express their opinions, but that some words contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, Act,41 stereotypes of Haitians and the foul language that is not to broadcast during the day."
The Council has also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the release of the names of two people who were suicide, have not breached the codes on broadcasting.
The SNAB had received several complaints about comments made during in-advance emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front policy13 social people of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding the suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had felt that suicide is a gesture of cowardly.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the events in question" Dupont lunch "have touched on a sensitive topic of fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was selected in his place.
The latest dispute focused on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a showdown media which had attracted a lot of reactions.
The facilitator CHOI said that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is a representation unduly negative Haitians.
"I've already served my suspension three days on this."
"My file is blank for a year and a half," said the facilitator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM worked "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station that will, among others, announce these decisions once during prime time within a period of three days.
A king of the kung-fu Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), Thai kickboxing and boxing rises on the tatamis and the rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts, such as the kung-fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the city since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I am seeking fighting everywhere, as for those who do not like the game on the ground now mixed martial arts competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, who works as a security officer and as committed to the company UPS has rightly issued bad news for its rivals, winning two gold medals at the world amateur championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and boxing Thai he explained."
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the World Cup of san shou."
"The fighters who have finished among the top four at the last World Championships in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I have concluded the tournament ranked fifth, while Llegué third in Toronto in 2009, said."
"What is interesting is that I have made progress in each competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or the next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where kicked and punched, and projections to the soil, are allowed.
Greenspan originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most entschieden pugiliste from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung The, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal was to retain a single event in his career, he will answer certainly his presence at the super-premium tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This is the most relieved and most prestigious competition in China, said the nice big."
"It is a little the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stage of Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in the semi-finals of its class (80 kilograms), before losing in the final.
"I was defeated was a true pro he analyzed."
"There are four veterans by category (80 kilograms, 85 kilograms, 90 kilograms and 90 kilograms)."
"The semi-final winners competing in the final of their category."
"Then, the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted OTC $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain engineering firms - A- Sarcelle - Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms OPI, firm, SMs Group and Axor who has obtained the most important, the stewardship of the project, for a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium called Energyand stewarship was established in 2004 to co-existing in the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private its responsibility to manage this important hydro project $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Energyand stewarship here won the lucrative contract without that there has been a public tender.
For the Parti Quebecois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
"This is the new way of making the collusion and break down the competition."
"That the people, instead of making secret that now are open," said yesterday the Member péquiste Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard has raised the issue at the National Assembly because he said difficult to see how the public interest can be used this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there has been collusion for this contract.
"I began to have my trip," she pesté, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "failed to rigour."
She said that "this would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to consolidate their respective expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The project includes a high level of complexity given the scope of work.
The site is underway and properly until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition should act; there have been negotiations.
Also, the formula is more an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As the revealed last week Le Devoir, the formula consortia in the area of engineering consultant is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the business register of Québec permits counting more than 200 consortia, including some seem permanent.
Thus, the firm firm works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNCLavalin and other Roche and Tecsult's.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single corporation, is firm.
In terms of the consortium Energyand stewarship, Minister Normandeau stressed that " the territory of James Bay meets specific dynamic workforce and that Hydro-Québec responds differently since the 1970s.
The big boss of the project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Corporation of James Bay (SEBJ), has given an explanation which has frowned on the fact that the draft stewarship contract was awarded OTC.
"If you go in tender and that there was little bidders, assured. prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either that you take people who are in the world--that market and that you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Energyand stewarship is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec/SEBJ for the project Eastmain 1 - A- Sarcelle - Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir scored 109 engineering consulting contracts between 2002 and March 2010 firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNCLavalin took 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult's 14 and firm 10, not counting its participation in Energyand stewarship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They account for 449,783,344 dollars, including the contract to Energyand stewarship 295 Y.,131 564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, firm, SMs Group and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that the "-fund," prior to clarify that it was rather of its leaders.
Baromètre responsible consumption - the label "green" does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer QUEBECOIS very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also the fair marks and écologisantes certifications to guide its choice.
Worse, even if it basks in a media universe where the messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, it regretted a lack of credible information, carence that it describes as a brake on its commitment, shows the Eurobarometer showed responsible consumption, with the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they have increased the use of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies like green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre of responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official qualifications placed on the so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of products and brands C$0.647-a as eco-friendly, shows the Eurobarometer showed.
In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
The information in the field of responsible consumption appears paramount to stimulate this part of the consumption currently Member-State-driven nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second dis-incentive identified by the Eurobarometer showed higher, after the price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of alleged performance green products or services that are seeking to put their hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed brand or several products to meet their conviction.
Up to 61%, they have also promoted purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and privileged the purchase of food grown in their region, shows the Eurobarometer showed.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 this year - Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint in concern for the protection of animals.
But its ecological and social consciousness seems, however, remain outside of his car, shows the Eurobarometer showed: in 2010, only 28% of farming-forestry reported using public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their interests green.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first cliched.
A loan from the state for the redemption of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who was asked to commit themselves financially in the redemption of the complex of cinema eXcentris Angus' by the Corporation and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but up to a loan only.
The Angus' Development Corporation and the Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to Daniel Langlois Drapor complex film eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent restore its full cinéphilique vocation, do not get what they wanted.
The Government agrees to be involved in the case, but to its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of Quebec proposes a loan that the amount would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to the recommendations2, at least in the view of the sources from the headquarters of the state.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan have been sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society of development of cultural undertakings (SODEC), Francois Macerola's, who pilot the record of eXcentris.
It sent a final report there are a dozen days.
But the cabinet counter-bill came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus' have until 31 December to respond.
It appears, however, that the hypothesis of donation of the State should really be ruled out.
Let us remember that the Association of Quebec cinemas and cinéparcs owners opposed to a direct investment of the state to support the redemption of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance real estate projects, what it has not done for other movie theatres.
But several players in the community demanded instead a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, has for 10 years to end arms copyright film in its premises of the complex after having financed itself its construction, which could justify a derogation of the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is acute in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to loyal customers.
The Angus' Society and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, lead, for their part, the private fundraising campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallèle, continues to distribute films to eXcentris.
The purpose of future 5.2.2.b. is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February projecting the beautiful film Xavier Beauvois of men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think the downward proposals that are made.
The veil lifted on a complexé...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States consider the complex Oyarregui of officiallanguages Americans, but they are also the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats wonder that every Canadian elector was not the Canada-U.S. to mind in voting and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to get its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, over the public yesterday, offer more details croustillants that substantial content to put the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in full federal election campaign, recounts how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the amazement of the US ambassador stationed in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"A complex of Canadian Oyarregui inherent almost a prerequisite for perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of daily rather than to focus this election on the United States (as in the campaign on the free trade in 1988)," he wrote.
The United States are therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk."
Ambassador understands even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
Another expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, offence.409 President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence early February on the federal budget, by which Canada posted its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being toppled by the coalition and the opposition parties made suvival conditional on the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington from the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC refer the United States.
Ambassador s'inquiète emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No Fly List" or the abduction for interrogation to the CIA.
Another cable excusez-moi that, at their first meeting bilateral, Hillary Clinton has asked its counterpart French Bernard Kouchner if Europe was prepared to welcome some prisoners of Guantànamo.
Mr. Kouchner has answered yes, but on the basis of the "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, written in, "he submitted a paper to the Secretary of State in respect of Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
We note finally that sometimes became emotional on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the head of this mass flight should be "murdered."
It has been echoed by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN has proposed yesterday in Cancún a renovation domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which corresponds almost one-third of the additional reduction the need to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the large concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs still take 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by lighting Learn or, better, bulbs to light-emitting diodes (LED or "LED" in English), the bulk of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GHG issued on the planet to inform humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of global car park.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to pass the overall GHG emissions of 53 gigatonnes 49 gigatonnes.
From this review, but it will still be 5 gigatonnes to stabilise 2020 climate rising to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid it becomes out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With lighting Learn, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new lamps to LED, reduces the need for energy of two again.
Fluorescent lightbulbs last for an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new lamps to LED, such as those that launched the non-export Philips this week - the company has participated in the study of the UN-the, have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a smouldering bulb, which gives an idea of the economy as possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All new bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to emit very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have shown reservations against lighting Learn because they contain mercury, and that it must eliminate as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except if manufacturers implement instructions.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the light bulb indicated, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would be 2.5 billion.
The Côte d'Ivoire expected in the nervousness the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, called "without delay" the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of deadlines.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the IECOM to complete its work and without more time to announce the interim results, said a spokesman of the head of the UN."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to abstain from any initiative up to the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing results, three days after the election on Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the Chairman of the CIS had said on television that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS proclaimed the winner of the second round between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council votes "fraudulent" in the north, held by the former rebel New Forces (FN) since the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, has said that intimidation practised by the FN voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president to go vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are deducted by the Constitutional Council.
Yet opponents of Gbagbo felt that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, North man denies any link with the former rebels, was deemed "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it is not INCB's to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and complain to the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, Sunday, was supposed to top the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country remained split into two for years.
The UN warned Wednesday the political class ivoirienne that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had topped the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% with the overseas departments), show the data corrected for seasonal variations (CVS) interim published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed stood at 2,631 million in city.
The data from the second quarter have been confirmed to 9.3% of the workforce in metropolis and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
A year ago, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available in the two weeks to work and that they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, brought to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 point in three months, 0.5 point on a year) and 25% by including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
Senior citizens have been a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolis (+ 0.2 points on three months and a year), or US$482 000 people 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter, to 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 percentage point in three months, a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE no longer releases monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues in contrast and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexander Guérini indicted and detained
Alexander Guérini, 53 years, leader of waste treatment companies and brother of criminalistics president of the General Council Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and in imprisonment to the house arrest of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexander Guérini was indicted for abuse of social goods, misappropriation of public funds and property, concealment, bribery, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini was combative and takes to explain all the questions that the judge will ask, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to continue for a multitude of concerned.32 leaders, it is another thing to prove," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the criminalistics strong man in the department, 1980s Guérini, through its lawyers, has held to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been indicted Wednesday evening and in imprisonment.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never been anything other than to operate the 2-Be that he had to manage.
Regarding the allocation of markets or to the destination of funds related to their operation, he never had knowledge, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of l'agglomération services g n, was indicted Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with ban to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client was able to provide explanations to the facts that he is accused."
"The investigator has taken into account not depriving them of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann's Arnoux.
Four other people had been placed in review and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, General co-conductor slime-free of Marseille Provence (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence peddling and corruption."
Two officials of the town of g n, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "evasion and misappropriation of public property by a person to a public service mission," the other for "complicity of misappropriation of public funds."
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been in "-approach abuse of social goods" review.
Among those who have been facing Guérini Stéphane Brunengo - Girard is in imprisonment recently in a parallel case of fraudulent procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect companies used to launder money from the gangsters.
The survey is conducted in the framework of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 in the wake of anonymous letters, for the alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, especially in the filiere waste.
Source close to the investigation, investigations focus in particular on the award and operating conditions of The Ciotat landfills.?, which collects waste g n as well as some cities of the urban community in Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: l'Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young researcher French arrested in Iran for "spying," was held in breath-testing opinion in France, being alert diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how l'Elysée explained his strategy for the Americans, up to their advice for the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had to return the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by US justice for trafficking of materials to the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a bright light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
Diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostages."
The advisor to the Elysée Palace for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interviewing the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their nationals selected force in Iran.
"Made of noise," they say, ' martelez constantly "in the media the words" fundamental rights of man, "innocence.," "immediate release."
It must in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Let all the more that the Iranians ask you to do so."
Because past attempts to discussions by discrete channels, "the silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics."
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Canadian-Iranian tactic: the hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, when she sought refuge at the Embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians a large sum of money" (230,000 euros bail).
And he said that l'Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon which "will escalate."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another some 1,800 citizens French living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the United States are demanding extradition for an illegal trafficking of electronic sensitive material to Iran, is released in Paris, on decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, as many observers questioned this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks downs Iran's acquisition of material clandestine networks for nuclear program, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France she accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
L'Elysée, he said, has not only been completely taken by surprise by the decision of the judge," but sought to oppose it.
"There has been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the custody of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the government cannot go back on the decision" judicial, says.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the " monitoring the French intelligence services.
The advisor to the Elysée composed a telephone number, docks, and informed the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, l'Elysée did not mince his efforts, through releases and "leaks" held in the media, to suggest that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity without irony, and find the manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles depreciation-indeed the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the "blitz' media official French."
On what is based "gratitude" expressed to Assad, wondered the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then examines the reasons that led l'Elysée to pay in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "seeks to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," analysis says.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeservedly criminalised."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to demonstrate to Syria what praise it can draw in playing a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US Embassy knows good source.
On 11 August, François Richier gave him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked even."
"This should at least confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received at the Élysée Palace.
In a news release, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for the young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cinderella" law which will ban adolescents to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, reported government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask the online game companies to block access to these games after midnight, youth aged less than 16 years, have said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play in these games all night and then difficult to study and to have a normal life at the school during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said BSFO Jo Rin, the departmental in charge of the bill.
Online gambling will again be available to 6 hours of the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law is clarified.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time for daily access to these games for young people whose parents so request, added the responsible.
It will also provide people who are calling for free software that allow us to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the newspapers regularly about various facts related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizers countries
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of FIFA designates Thursday organizers countries World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying are likely to take on the technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 competition Queen FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands - Belgium).
2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities part of delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the political and economic issues of the World Cup.
The scenes' informationwas are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of FIFA, the English records, Latin, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations are not very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that have led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, cradle of football that has hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC has submitted a layer, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary that health-security three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What upset FIFA and embarrassment English officials, who have embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of the government hopes reissue the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005, the organisation of the Games for London 2012.
This intense activity be enough to rebadge " of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain - Portugal does not lack of assets with its stages ready, his expertise (Mondial - 82 in Spain, OJ -92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the sombres financial and economic prospects of the two countries could a good sailor their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are only increasing the rating of Russia, become an outsider weight despite the shortcomings of his record (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to not make the trip to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a reference to thinly veiled accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"It covers mud, we try to compromise," Mr. Putin was launched.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favourites.
First global economic power, seat of the major sponsors of FIFA, the country appears to be a firstmover advantage over Japan and South Korea, who have built separately a wonderful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries having co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of Mondial - 2026 to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would make obsolete Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, who broke the adesso in proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new lands, but these two countries pose greater risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights excise-duty-paid (jetlag) by the European countries, the sinews of war to FIFA.
Second mandate: l'évidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand did believe that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than them.
A mandate to the Elysée Palace is another.
Therefore the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then it must be as if the doubt still existed.
In a sense, as in the other.
In 2006, even without suggests, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that it would take its decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011."
He men-tioned in front of parliamentary Pluriel, Tuesday night at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" therefore caused a bit of currency-exposed.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far.
The president did that remind you that the constitutional revision of 2008 restricted to two the number of quinquennats.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that it refers to the presidential election, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you have again for seven years and a half with me," he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: ' Do not believe that I do not think about the stage after."
His comments the day before yesterday not more candidate than the day before; they do not make it less.
If they are causing comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination to criminalistics a share.
But it is not the entry in contention Ségolène Royal leads Sarkozy to unveil.
It is the opposite because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many criminalistics are calling for an earlier than planned in order of battle.
The bad polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the nomination of François Fillon to that of French President Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA - the Express).
"We have a candidate and there was no discussion at the Pluriel on this," immediately and cautiously reacted the entourage of Prime Minister.
"If it believes the defeat possible, it will not be candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned Selfevidently.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of securities to state
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year should be the opportunity to clarify the exit procedures, or at least, to announce the arrest of many unconventional operations of monetary policy which must be achèver at the end of the year.
Crisis in European sovereign debt requires, the Frankfurt d'Émission institute can not afford to be as compelling subject to aggravate a tense situation today on the bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, and welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the crisis of the debts of the states in Europe.
It did not say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, increasing its sovereign bond purchasing program.
"I reserve my thinking to my European partners (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the ECB's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown more disert about his intentions, merely to indicate that the program to purchase of state securities on the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB have doubled the last week, to nearly US$1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Portuguese and Irish debt, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, expectations of further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a significant change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter still conducts unlimited allocations of cash under generous conditions and to varying 1931-1976 a week to three months.
Economists now expect that this device is extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it amends significantly its program."
"Otherwise this would take the risk of provoking new tensions in short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter 2011 seems more likely," " anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist for Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the market of the public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to facilitate a sluggish market," Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the d'Émission Institute has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"He must at all costs to replace the lack of investors on the market and act so as to prevent a runaway yields paid by the most fragile states," reflected an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are soaring, the states will be even more embarrassed to reduce debt, otherwise the stabilize.
The preservation of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is riding
After an early week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little relaxed, yesterday, with the decline in long-term bond rates to 10 years.
A return to calm precarious.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of region said they had heard Giulio Tremonti described as the situation "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable," which he then denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of contracts cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in a certain panic in Rome.
Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was above 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "strong concern" by " the market turbulence and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and weak tax revenues that goes with, putting the state the risk of no longer being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget review in the Senate table on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will represent still 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9 per cent forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new collective budget that could be put in place after the holiday season, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, nor in the short or the long term, because in spite of its large debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, acknowledged Chancellor Schüssel's notion), the stabilisation efforts requested to Italy are lower than those requested to other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the House of Deputies, after which elections could be held late March.
Then would open a period little conducive to the decisionmaking in cases of serious crisis.
The Europeans are considering building anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde stressed again yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that it has demonstrated Sunday in the day and into the night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currencies and their monetary zone."
Although relative, relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European state bonds has provided grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the more C1045 target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and visibility policy, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," believe economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more that "the political time is much slower than the time of the markets."
Aware of this gap and the dangers that it contains, the European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers from the G20 are going well.
And in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro area in the firing line markets (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors extrême-orientaux developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly is preparing the ground.
The first emissions of EFSF titles are planned next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilised by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
The countries that are in the front line, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, is preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that add to the greenhouse closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path to those of Greece and Ireland.
One and the other take at any price to avoid request international assistance before putting in place their own MSLA budget and decide the necessary structural reforms to sustainably confidence.
European funding, finally, talk on the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
Mark in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced the idea that if the?750 billion countries12 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the EU would not hesitate to call the hand to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a key player in the market for European sovereign debt, saw an increase of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle is: it is the European Stabilization Mechanism financial fully-resourced, to this day, 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being examined closely in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions empiraient.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still engender-make traffic problems, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and ice.
The d'Eure-et-Loir, the Les Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, Eure were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
In France, the soutenues snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and low snow on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente region, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finisterre, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of Lower Normandy region, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowy episodes are sufficiently Briceni to create traffic problems and disrupt certain economic activities, warns France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several départementales have been banned to lorries over 7.5 tonnes, the axes Guingamp - Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult in the Mounties who recommend not take his vehicle in case of necessity and the movement of certain coaches TER has been suspended for the day.
School transport has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
There was no specific measure Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urge all motorists to caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights on Paris airport Roissy and 10% to Orly because of snow to come.
The DGAC advises passengers to contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Paris: first Grand métro financial sketches
Since the time that the debate around the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the government billion.
In the discussion of the less.
In particular, P23B is men-tioned for the métro Grand Paris to build the Greater Paris Society.
To start this bbiiity, the state has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical, it is this sum which then will allow the bbiiity to borrow on the markets a share of the funding of his double loop.
Now, finally, it comes to the first add-backs.
The law on finances 2010, under Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains devices to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the establishment of a special tax equipment and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, says in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public Society of Greater Paris institution."
It is C$20-million: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a GCHRMS of a tax on offices that is already "in order to modernise, increase the product and to allocate the increase in the Greater Paris Society."
This would yield how?
Mystery.
This is not quantified in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources complement the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation will be mobilized by the state and made to the Society of Greater Paris as the project," reads the explanatory statement.
The bbiiity, we do not find this shocking system.
"From the moment we created (the two taxes, revenue growth), we can cover the studies on three years and then typing in the 4 billion after, explains do we."
"This will be included in the budget and fired as."
The bbiiity believes that the 4-billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still subscribers, risks provoking a parliamentary discussion a little flustered.
First public session on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and spies diligence
The case Wikileaks has a dual value.
One hand, it is an apparent scandal, one that is as scandal before the hypocrisy which governs the relationship between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other, it announces changes at international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression.
But £15,000 order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is confirmation of the fact that each file by a secret service (of whatever nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" gratae.13 US on sexual habits of Berlusconi only on Science-driven who for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the profile eerily caricature of Gaddafi was long for the artists cabaret skit.
The rule according to which the secret files should be composed of new already known is essential to the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a bookshop on esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeat (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templiers or Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And not only because the author of dark texts do not like to unpublished research (and does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those involved in the alchemy does not believe that what they know already, and that confirm what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The content-provider's is lazy, lazy (or spirit limited) the head of the secret services (otherwise it could be, whatever, editor of Libération), which is as true that what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to the Department of State were the same as those that Newsweek magazine ran the week before.
So why the revelations on these issues have so much noise?
For one, they say that any person cultivated is already known, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, except for some small exercises of representation, turned into centres of espionage.
Any investigative film viewer knows this, and it is only by hypocrisy that are pretending to ignore.
However, the repeat publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country deals a significant blow to the prestige of the Department of State.
The scandal does not crisis victims that the "5401B."
But let us move on to the nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of Orwell, you could design power as a Big Brother, which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely stage6 since, that can monitor each movement through the phone, every transaction, the hotel visited, Highway borrowed and following the citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when it shows, as it happens now, that even the cryptes of the secrets of power cannot escape the control ceases to be a hacker one-way and becomes circular.
The control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as vengeful citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the opportunity to maintain its own secret can take?
It is true, Georg Simmel said already, that a true secret is a secret vacuum (and secret vacuum will never be disclosed); it is true, too, that all know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret empty of secrecy, because falling within the public domain; but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means remove any power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but in fact a too large to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful?
In the future, it is clear that states can no longer be in line no information - this would be tantamount to publish on a poster hung at the corner of the street.
But it is also obvious that with the current technologies, it is pointless to hope to be able to maintain the confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state has moved aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future the reserved and private reports?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast therefore is science fiction and novels, but I am obliged to conceive of government agents who move quietly in coaches uncontrollable routes, as did growthgenerating that messages learned by heart, or at most, by hiding the few written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copy in drawers locked: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now advance in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has restored a telegraph on son (telephone).
The L'énergie (analog) had allowed researchers film to explore a film not going forward and backwards and in discovering all the secrets of the assembly, whereas now CDs (digital) do that to jump to chapter, i.e. macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we are going to Rome to Milan in three hours, then that plane, and travel that it includes, it takes three hours and a half.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the political and the technical communications from horseback cars.
A final observation.
Once, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secrecy of embassies.
Now, this is the embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France bidouille its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the respect of the promises of funding quickly released (Aeranautical fast start or early funding) made by the developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries are committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU took the adesso to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment regarding the funding fast start: report detailing the activities of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of leaflets...
The operation transparency is appreciable and appreciated at its right value: developing countries and civil society would like that all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announcement have reached in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which puts on the right path for the respect of his commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money should be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states including France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that is best.
The European Commission has for example seen as reference year 2009: the international funding are maintained, and she adds $150 million over three years under funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of the support of France for developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding..."
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 lent equivalent to 1.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that we will recover as equivalent to a euro that it gives... at most, should be counted in respect of its commitments that the cost of the loan for the country lender (or the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the document of the EU to check yourself.
It is the only country in the European Union to use if massively the loan.
Germany requires to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other) respect their commitments with 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 to meet its commitment, France does that 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice sleight of hand!
In summary, in its funding fast start, France operates a double anti-rackets: one on the evolution of the action in the time and on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it happens to make believe that spends $420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Department of Finance (because it appears that it is Bercy who has made arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is a small matter, on short term, compared to the whole discussion on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the conflict.35.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Regardless, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently discussed): you will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues that it is on others.
The hope is based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary to make progress in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years interfering in different81 chemicals a day, according to a study published Wednesday in the association Generations Futures (ex-public Movement for Rights and the respect of future generations).
The association, which warned that its results "were not significant statistical value in the light of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," has purchased between July and September foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child, in the Oise Vangyard a dozen years and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three dairy and 1.5 litre of water per day - as well as sweets, have been examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet of the base is overwhelming: 81 chemicals which 42 are probable or possible carcinogens and five substances are carcinogenic some and 37 likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we can see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and/or EP is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as some 2000xxiv and nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, presents traces of six chemicals that PKPB1 still banned in France.
Same thing for the green beans from Kenya, included in the luncheon, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak chopped, canned tuna, and even the loaves of bread and chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
