Black box in your car?
While the saga of the American educational body Road, the highway system to improve from the shortage of funds, many of which they are the solution in the small black box which is in your car, see on the dashboard is fit from cleaning.
This device, which is run by mōṭara-cālaka track every vehicle miles for your information is transmitted and, as I say, is America's main vitata-pōṣaṇa of roads have become outdated system to the restoration of Washington and to the state Office of Planning is a controversial effort to become an issue.
The highway is usually a sudden as boring planning is also a deep and lively debate has become the issue of coalition.
You have to have drive by miles, and perhaps there has been a drive to keep details of place - and then use this information for tax bill - the government is ready to use the black box to allow for support in favour of libarēṭēriyana with environmental groups.
Bhaucakakī tea party.
The American Civil Liberties Union also again.and different types of privacy issues is really worried.
While Congress could not agree on the fact that further action is necessary or not, many state shouldn't be waiting.
It is that they're looking for in the next decade, how they can be in any system, in which every driver on the road, a fixed payment for miles.
Test drive for thousands of mōṭara-cālakōṁ has already taken the black box, which is in some mōnīṭariṅga jī.pī.ēsa..
It is essential for our country in fact object.
"This is for us to be selected or not is not merely says:" It's the government of South California ikharātā Hassan, who as executive director of the Union, expressed in California by the year mōṭara-cālakōṁ decide to track every miles to the beginning of the planning.
We can be in the pay of the changes is going to be.
The technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund, which is nearly bankrupt, vitata-pōṣaṇa by American citizens to be on pump gas from the payment of taxes.
The American people will not purchase gas as it was before.
Now more than before in less than a gas car goes miles.
No federal tax increase in the last 20 years, which is not less than 18.4 cents.
Due to the high price of gas makes a penny in tax revenue from growth.
University of Minnesota expert in transport policy, "says Lee munikha gas tax is not quite sanvahanīya".
He has to test the system of payments parati-mīla recently invested in 500 cars tracking device.
In the longer term, "he says that is the most half-allegorical alternative work".
It says vōṅkasa mā'ilēja-ādhārita user fees.
It is not surprising that it is the urban liberals, trying, as, for example, to operate the car to change one's ways of taxes in jams, which can be less than three years and can help to reduce greenhouse gases.
California's planner on this system, but they are interested in the state's global warming law laid down in the pretentious for goal to finish things are being developed.
But the Ministry of Transport, chairman of the Committee on the black box also śusaṭara Ripa (ā.-pī.ē.). Bill long-term options as the most viable.
Independent vendor - is also in the foundation by the driver are in favour of pay per mile.
In the vice president's policy - is ēḍariyana Moor, he said, "it's not just that it is being well in blind".
The thing that people are getting more explicitly, that it can pay for.
It is as if by two former U.S. transportation secretaries, who also support is given in its report in 2011 from Congress to move forward in the direction of paid parati-mīla's favour.
Last year, the U.S. Senate had approved $90-miliyana test of the project, which would have become involved 10,000 cars.
But worries of rural antiquity tried at the representative of the people, which was in the city that day, or to go to work but they are much more miles to go, under the leadership of the House has to have her on the proposal.
However, many state and city are flying to increase further in this direction.
Get the most out of Oregon, which is more willing to use the country's largest listed in the 5,000 drivers.
These drivers can soon mā'ilēja state instead of 60% of the gas will pay.
Nevada has already made initial testing is complete.
New York City is moving even further in this direction.
To cope with the trucks on the narrow base of Illinois.
And with the coalition of the Eastern Seaboard ā'ī-95 17 of the state transport department, including humans (mērīlaiṇḍa pēnasilavēniyā, Virginia and Florida, it " s that they are studying how can the implementation of this change.
Support on this idea at that location could not be found.
In Nevada, where more than 50 voluntary car drivers before this device on your car, the driver was calling for this very impatient thinking that the government can monitor their every step.
Nevada member in the Department of Transport and the strategic management, directed the ala-ud-din Khan says "big brother and in the same kind of worry about the other things that had major problems".
It is not something, that people wanted.
At the same time, the test ahead of Nevada's ē.sī.ēla.yū. warning on his website: "They are in full tracking device into the device, much of it will be easier".
Aparabandhanīya ḍhān̄cā-sanracanā technology, there is no need to develop, which is not a record of every day of every person to keep from spreading as it was inevitable.
Nevada is from those in many states, item and technology, which has been trying to get the can, with the help of the state which could details of how many miles the car every day that there has been and where it is, but it is not what is going on.
Khan said that if you can do that, then people can feel more intuitive.
The quest for this technology has made some small agencies in the state of California, called the true mā'ilēja saṭāraṭa-apa have transported.
It's essentially a firm to help drivers can state was not in business.
It's a growing market of auto insurance has been trying to enter, in which drivers had to pay on the basis of his mā'ilēja.
But it was the test of the device, which he, as well as the highway jī.pī.ēsa. yōjanākārōṁ, of a very limited and not used, which provides information on the time lag is uploaded by the modem.
True mā'ilēja main adhiśāsī rayon Morrison said, "If you people do not track their speed and location, they will be more willing to take on in such a way".
Some of these early in the functions of the state are large errors.
There are many ways to intervene and less lavish.
The planner in Oregon, using different options.
With or without the device of jī.pī.ēsa. jī.pī.ēsa. they can choose.
Or can choose not to take any of the device, are determined by the residents of the state to be fixed on the basis of average mileage can choose to pay.
Other places in the hope that the device instead of less is more concerned by citizens and facilities in the determination it can be sold.
In New York City, transport officials to develop such ṭaikasiṅga device are still having to pay the parking meters, of which 60% of his service, "drive" insurance will be paid according to and from other operators of real time speed mōṭara-cālaka collection of data will be made, which was used to avoid traffic.
City planning has been referred to in the document, "because of the benefits it received mōṭara-cālaka participation will be attracted to it".
However, some transport, one wonders, that probably is the yōjanākārōṁ miles all discussion on big distractions, according to the settlement.
In the Bay of San pharainsisakō Metropolitan Transport Commission in Congress, said the gas tax by bankruptcy of the highway trust fund can deal with the problem is very easily.
Operators of other hybrid cars or on extra annual fee of ēka-samaya or can be used as the vehicle, which also is much more gas, so that they do not use proper part of his pay.
The Commission's director of legislative and public affairs, Randy rēṇṭaśēlara from aspirin "when he can be good do you have of āmūlacūla for surgery".
If we do so, then his millions of car drivers and other privacy will be concerned for a lot of these things.

Scientists have already made on the subject and that the dog's tail with his antics and mood of what's in between.
The last reported that according to the dog's tail is happy with his point of view on the right are more than via (kutatē if you talk about his dog's tail, while the more you shake mainly on the left side.
But now, scientists say that this subtle distinction in his dog's tail can recognize and can express its response.
The study has been published in the current journal bāyalōjī.
Neuroscientist, professor at the University of Georgia ṭarēṇṭō vēlalaraṭigarā from Steven reported: "Men are very well known and this is all in the mind of the part of left and right are different from that in the excitement, which include generating positive or negative emotions".
Here we see it also in other species is attempted.
Dogs, like humans, said that even in the right part of the brain and the antics of his left hand he was responsible for the opposite order, and two different roles in gōlāradadhōṁ has feelings.
To learn more about this by other dogs for the single that dog react with each other on how to move the tail, would see films of dogs has on other animals.
He measured the heart of itall of domestic dogs and analysis of their behaviour.
We understand their tail is probably not more than ever why the shaking on the one hand at other times.
Professor Steven reported: "The dogs we vēlalaraṭigarā films of dogs, presented with the realistic - in uljhan version or to deal with other issues affecting chāyā-citara, and we could see the action of the tail and the tail can be more in the left or right".
When the animals are caused by the dog's stolid (kutatē (in terms of their tail as a right, they have seen you shake so freely.
But when he changed direction to the tail (mainly on the left side looked like a dog (in terms of their rate of heart beat and they talk about is increased.
According to Professor vēlalaraṭigarā they didn't think through the antics of these dogs are not to communicate with each other.
Instead, they think that dog has learnt this from my own experience, which is that he should be concerned about the action and not on how.
He said: "If you go to other dogs, and there are many times when they're on their tail as if you are one of the good far more, with less, and is related to the right part offers good behaviour, you react with each other on the basis of the same experience".
Researchers say that these conclusions, the team of animal owners and trainers about the feelings of animals can provide better information.
The University of Bristol's School of vēṭaranērī fellow guest of the Sciences, a specialist on the behaviour of dogs, John barēḍaśō said that this is the first study to check that the dog is not important part for the left or the right or not.
Last year at the University of Lincoln's team found was that when they see a dog's aggressive dog left his head like a dog and are happy to see his head on the right are like.
Other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, in contrast to the study a-mitalian batāyā: he "- This robot dog's tail hilā'ī than right on the left side of the dog, but instead of getting close to the mark was more likely to get".
He said that the differences in the studies was so different from his animals in films or not fully understand श्वान dog robot.
He explained that the reaction of a real dog by dogs it's methods can help study.
"There is enough evidence from different mammals are the two parts of the brain that's used for different purposes, to get more details and is also yet to come - and in this case, the dog is no exception", he said.
However, easily the behavior which can be recorded, and we have to understand that their tail is probably not more than ever why the shaking on the one hand at other times.

In the end, the new vaccine is ēṇṭī-nikōṭīna can enjoy smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine is ēṇṭī-nikōṭīna of fats, such as smoking, that can put an end to the pleasures.
One dose of vaccine, for the whole life of the mice nīkōṭīna was able to protect yourself from addiction.
Before the trial started on the man from the front and the need for testing, which may take many years in New York, but is a professor of vīla Cornell Medical College in Ronald Crystal said that the earlier positive signal.
Professor at Cornell, said that "we have a lot of hope that this type of vaccine strategy will eventually be able to help millions of people smoking in the market today, who has a presence in all of the systems attempted to use to give up, but he found that nicotine addiction from their current systems, is much more powerful".
The new vaccine, which is in a harmless virus, with the aim of creating ēṇṭībōḍīja ēṇṭī-nikōṭīna genetic information has been prepared for.
This is the virus to infect cells, as well as the liver, which is a permanent stream of ēṇṭībōḍīja after that and make.
Any nicotine hits ēṇṭībōḍīja in search of blood, and before they do not remain in mind by ineffectual dhūmarapānakaratā to nicotine will see of him from within.
The test of the vaccine, the mice are given nicotine, which they later his normal activity.
Researchers say that the vaccine is not rats, but it was nice to have him, "" nicotine, it is a signal that his mind was known.
This experiment, described in a magazine called mēḍisina ṭarānsalēśanala science.
The demand for tobacco, of the vaccine, because they were so failed ēṇṭībōḍīja.
It was to be, in part, at regular intervals, so that the level of ēṇṭībōḍīja and expensive, but it's been proven avayavahārika.
But the new vaccine's hope of being rather, because of the liver cell ēṇṭībōḍī factory will create.
Professor Crystal said that if the full protection of the future human vaccine so that it's been the greed of children, before trying a cigarette is a bad, so that they can be protected from of nicotine addiction.
But perhaps this is used by the people who give up smoking will be used for.
He said that "they know that if they do so they start smoking again of nicotine vaccine is no fun of them from smoking, which is his wont, will be able to help in the rescue.
British scientists said the results are interesting, but many of the need for more research to be warned.

Howling of disappointment of Obama's voters.
I change in than Obama did vote twice
He says that the policy of intercepting jī.ō.pī. Obama's been great for obstructing effort
The website of the whole policy of ōbāmākēyara ḍarōna takalīphēṁ, they can not excuse of attacks.
Obama's 2008 memoir of kaimapēna reminds them that was what is likely to happen.
Naithēniyala P. Morris in the second year student at Harvard Medical School.
Today I'm very tragic reading books.
It's such a book, which I think it's during the second year of medical school will boost my sorrow and I expected in kirron jagāyēgī.
It's called "the courage of the Iraqi resistance", and it is the president of Barack Obama's election campaign in the year 2008 of sansamarikā.
Any mention of his patients in the night, when I was in my phurasatā from me on the bed and give me a book at a time so it will take in millions of people, which was inspired by politics, and the speech of your breath and put it right.
Election news ēkatarapha speakers have proved to be at that time, and for representing the historical importance of punctuation.
In the eyes of my classmates behind, tears of joy and my parents can save each receive news letter said.
A group of young people to be visionary and the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
In 2008, Obama's approval rating when they had 82 per cent.
And then I closed his book.
The hard truth is the truth of the current one, for example, to come back from the world of dreams.
Remember those days of hope it is difficult - they seem to have a memory of a distant, a tragic memory of opportunities lost.
The first time I voted was in fact after the change to innovate.
It was as easy to put from in any can't even imagine.
I Obama, let me give you a lot of credit for achievements, ranging from aphōraḍēbala care act for the return of our troops from Iraq, "not" what not to ask about the end of Osama bin Laden to be killed.
Apart from that, I believe that our policy of something else to protest against the country's efforts to move forward with its many health service reform, including immigrant: public option, to close the airport on gavāntānāmō Bay, apart from the other.
But co-inmates-of asaṅkhayā time which I myself and colleagues before the Obama administration over the north side of the tracks I had it that I can give them.
I was on the point of political disappointment.
The leaders of the opposition of the Republican foreign policy is not the answer, nor jasoosi abroad ḍarōna attacks on innocent children in the north.
This is the common American citizens by the National Security Agency's personal data about to save the life of the state government can not answer wrong not to unravel the antics of the prosecution of people who can answer.
This is without any trial of American citizens of Anwar al Awlaki's death, nor can't tell the president during kaimapēna fewer boundaries and expenditure of public funds.
It's not the answer to the findings of the report, which is to say that, by the White House to silence mīḍiyō nikasana attempt to get "the most aggressive since administration".
And it's only the most recent aphōraḍēbala Care Act signed into law, have to be in three years, even after the failure of a simple to design a website is not pretending.
I don't know what I expected it only.
If, at the age of 18, I ought to have that system of government to bring forward, it can, who denies political campaign.
A predictably direct that elected office is not the way political parties and, as opposed to random events such as the massacre nyūṭā'una, shape our public discussion will provide.
However, as I found most of the above example, they seem to have chosen by the administration of itself.
Do you talk about it is the maximum.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was very excited from his opponent.
A) Mitt Romney and an option to do so, or that his policies as to determine his position does not appear to be.
I thought that a second term for President Obama, who will be under pressure from the elections will be free of them, full of hope we will hear from which, for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's rating anumēādana is less than 45 per cent this week, the book was in return for the year 2008 through became very difficult.
I like the disappeared is reminded of promises.
This week, reading a book in part, which was described in his primary pēnasilavēniyā is how Obama nahu'ā so great was the loss of Clinton.
In a meeting with his kaimapēna pōsaṭa-māraṭama subordinate state employees to get them back on track, said that there is a need to satayaniṣaṭha on his motives, and of the people.
He said: "I want to get back his mojo".
We should remember who we are. "
Today, five years later, and I would ask you Mr President could not agree more.
There have been ideas expressed in this comment naithēniyala Morris's.

Aircraft from the passenger gate into the gate, to work, to read from her long game, the movie, but for your electronic device will be able to use - but will not be able to talk to your cell phone) it issued by Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday, under new atayadhika-pūravānumānita coordinates.
But the passengers of these changes should not be expected immediately.
In a news conference the administrator Michael hu'araṭā ēpha.ē.ē. said that the implementation of these changes is how sharply, it will be different in each airline.
Airlines must show the ēpha.ē.ē. it under their new, how is the one with the coordinates, and members of his party to demonstrate the driver training booklets of collection device and how to update the rules.
It is said that Vimanas ēpha.ē.ē. portable electronic device on the use of extended to some airlines already have acquired from the plans.
And those jēṭabalū Delta Airlines, who are already in plans turned out to be presented.
Ēpha.ē.ē. has said in a statement, "is a programme on the basis of the position of the very early in life, we voted to expand the use of electronic device.
At present, the passengers on the door closed, his smartphone, tablet and other device is needed to close.
They are supposed to arrive at a height of 10,000 feet of Vimanas by captain has been granted, and so on until they turn on them.
They are expected to use the aircraft's ever again take time off his device, and airplanes until they fully keep him from getting it running.
Under the new ēpha.ē.ē. said such Airlines aircraft which under electronic are safe from that, they lose their passengers by the flight took off at the time of time and place, ever so Vimanas ṭaikasī'iṅga device can be allowed to use.
Most of the new companies, airlines and other aircraft which are modified in a way that the passengers on the altitude of WiFi can use them to meet these standards are expected.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight aṭēṇḍēṇṭa galēḍiṅga laurā, has welcomed these changes.
Galēḍiṅga has said in a statement, "when there will be safe way of policy implementation - and we have to do that airlines will be working with companies - so it will be for the two sides to win more".
When it comes to this issue, we are apt to see mōnīṭarasa Hall as "bored".
But the agency said that less than 10,000 feet by connecting to the Internet at a height sarapha exchange, email, or send a message to get or data will also now have to be downloaded.
Passengers in your smartphone, tablet and other devices will be asked to keep ēyarapalēna mode.

Phone call of the Federal Communication Commission related to regulatory authority, have no ēpha.ē.ē..
When one of the aircraft flying and ēpha.ē.ē. during restrictions have been lifted on some electronic device.
Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board's mark of news which rōjēṅkana sī.bī.ēsa. national security specialist, said that the cell phone is considered still at risk.
Rōjēṅkara said, "are really serious about cell phone issue, not because they are more of a target from nēvigēśana-sambandhī device can generate, but also because this is in the air when the cell phone tower can generate more of a target.
For this issue to check ēpha.ē.ē. constituted by the industry advisory last month of personal electronic device, the government should be allowed to use more.
They are banned from use to reduce the pressure grows on ēpha.ē.ē. in recent years.
Sen., ḍī-mō maikakaisakilaka kalēyara said critics would like that prohibition is not a valid reason for security.
Enforcement of these restrictions has also been able to do and because we do not use the device is becoming as ubiquitous.
Some studies also suggest that your device is almost third passenger's directive to close are forgotten or ignored.
Ēpha.ē.ē. has the use of electronic device by people for years in 1996, when the passengers started to ban ēpha.ēma. by radio and the high technology of the time leading up to the gadget with navigation and communication equipment because of an interruption in the report was received.
New airlines, aircraft companies as compared to the previous generation of the electrical system, but they are also more dependent on ēpha.ē.ē. of resistance by electronic interference in order to be design and has been accepted.
Airlines from many years of passengers use WiFi at a height karūjiṅga been proposed.
Wi-Fi system has been modified for more of the investment bank is also a target.
Most airlines comanpanies hu'araṭā said that under the new guidelines, the electronic device for use in more should get up on the qualifying standards.
At the time of today's electronic device, as compared to the previous generation of electronic device is very low in power are emitted ṭarānsamiśana of radio.
For example, Page is ī-rīḍarasa palaṭanē, during the course of the nominal ṭarānsamiśana.
But while sending --block-device ṭarānsamiśana or by downloading the data are strong.
By passengers to use the device, had been banned from Amazon.com is also in favour of people who.
Officials of the company in 2011 in all his airlines ī-rīḍarasa Kindle and load it to the test procedures for the problems but never made any such a problem.
The risk from the use of the device in about why ēpha.ē.ē. advisory committee has to express feelings.

Seat width of the larger dispute for jet manufacturers ōraḍarasa at stake.
This month's Dubai airaśō dispute for a race to set up for the rhythm is there was a long parayaṭaka-kalāsa for flights of the width of the seats of the leading aircraft manufacturers for between
The dispute in Southern-style Vimanas īkōnōmī long flights of the width of the seat of the class has always focused on, such as which ēralā'insa but not be given by the allocation of places such as the SAS ērabasa lēṭēsaṭa jet and Boeing's efficiency by the company of any key..
This cabin ērabasa īkōnōmī this week at least 18 inch seat (46 cm) give detailed is expected of such industry standard but it should be set by his mukhayā-paratidavandavī ēralā'insa Boeing says.
The dispute between manufacturers Vimanas 17-21 comes when the events of 9 in the order after possible were recorded at a distance from the larger of the twin engine of ērakarēphaṭa varasana competition to sell.
How the department's previous Vimanas ,dwaparyugand specifically what has been created that is equal to 9 or 10 sīṭiṅga dāvō more capacity in meditation of the design of the Jets, considering the mini jambō agency?
Boeing 777 says this is "X" which made 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 in a row will ēkanāmika people in the department.
Airbus says A350 of the competition with this 18 inch left 350 people, will take the seat kept in equal 9.
Often high-profile Vimanas trade through advertising in the press prahaar do trade on technical matters.
Now, Airbus 777 SizeX airaśō Dubai with more than 100 in order to triumph over the front of the public, it is expected to appeal.
This is the war of vigiyāpana phinansērō irrespective of it started showing it all together in a restaurant you agree with one is it going to do?
Airbus sales chief John lēhī saṅkarīsīṭōṁ "Boeing also from regional turbo and presents in the flight of the long has been".
But even if the change, as people have been getting larger, but have not been changed the way kutapa Vimanas.
According to the U.S. Department of Health's data in the 1970s, when between Boeing 747 has long been the journey of the modern ne jambō had earlier been ant of the century, and the country has an average weight of 40 - to me American male, 49, is 10 per cent.
According to American health statistics in the 21st century, the average American is 39.7 inches, of the man.
Airbus says the concept of a seat of its rival the scalp from the 1950s when the new name is "jet set" was narrow, with an average of the periphery.
Airbus says he has set up a commission of the research which is an extra inch in seat width of 53 per cent of the improvement in the quality of sleep and suggestions.
Boeing said Airbus's seat, and the dispute on the measuring of āṅkaḍō said it is not on the decision of the manufacturers of how airlines fares and make for balance between suvidhā'ō..
It is also called, is reflected by the research of one seat more than the width of the depends on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing has said that the cabin expert Kent karāvēra. "It is, in fact, to solving lacīlāpana jinhēviśavāsa on those things and in order to succeed they need to do it".
"They wanted to show us what it is that they are not taking advantage of".
They know their business is better than that of any other.
The elbow room for phalā'iyarasa this supplier is about, but it's fast for this is an issue that can affect.
Behind this dispute at least 700 billion dollars of the order of business is difficult to Vimanas contestant-gone-unlucky US and European exports to tip the balance in the coming decade, enough.
For the first time in July ripōraṭanē rāyaṭara told of what the layout of the seat, in fact between the new jet Vimanas laḍā'īkā issue.
Airbus and Boeing claimed kārayadakaśatā per seat is 20 per cent of their section of the design of the new leader of the twin ēn̄jina 365-sīṭa Boeing 777-300, than that of the Council.
Boeing's display with claims it is up to 10 777 with 9 x one than with the original design on the 777.
Unit cost now equal to 10 in comparison with the use of.
Kevin kēnisaṭana, from the head of Airbus, the European passenger facility says it was his "Boeing aircraft of our products, and with more and more competitive seats to make is to take over".
On the other hand, analysts say the whole cabin 10-sīṭa-parati line is that the current 777 s suggestions for many of the passengers, which is in the hands of ḍēnasara layout as well as with cheap fares can be.
The interior cabin expert ranavē commenced, founder and editor of my girl network said: "Passengers seat width of 18 inches for a really great idea, but the reality is that the resolution of this trade point of Airbus 777 operated by death threats".
Airbus and Boeing do not supply of seats but airlines to choose from for a list of supplier are provided.
The vendor of the jet around the world on this competition is also lē'ā'uṭasa measures to check it carefully.
Also, more than all the rest of the jet bilaḍarasa Vimanas low cost regional airline and travel with high density for allowing lē'ā'uṭasa sschace.
The Airbus A350 has an equal 10 but says it is not yet sold.
Recent cabin, as long as the Airbus has more than of the facility for some of the jet has a vast Vimanas insisted on him.
Other manufacturers of modern jet planes without the support of flying on a new industry standard, but it is not likely to be of 777 X from the wave of sales.

Time may be large yauvana: before quickly
Research suggests that Hispanics and African-American girls her age than girls leucasis of youth are getting in at a young age.
This is not to say that the physical changes of puberty is near
There is no evidence that any other chemical or hōramōna can be blamed
Experts believe that in this age of puberty, or might be a reason.
In the case of the boys from the time before the youth is not as effective
Pat sī.ēna.ēna. ītharija kolaba correspondent of the health of children and family issues are in specialist journalist.
Whether the mother should be concerned if his daughter, 7 or 8 years of age, and the growth of breasts in the hair of the sex organs start to go?
In Orlando, Florida, this week, the annual conference of the American Children's Medical Academy Bal medical kaipalōviṭaja ēṇḍōkarā'inōlōjisaṭa Dr. Paul clearly told that these early physical change is a common sight in American girls, these are new.
The VIPs kaipalōviṭaja says, "I am convinced they had spent time in the middle - that I have, and most of the time it is complete from the rapid progress in the direction of youth are not needed".
The typical symptoms of such as development of the breast and armpit hair pollinate themselves, sex organs and body smell before you see time in girls.
But in the past four decades, in the age of rajōdaraśana māsika-dharama) reblyon (nominal change.
The average age in the United States, which is 12.5 years, in 1970, the year was 12.75.
"When it starts to develop into breast rajōdaraśana are in the first three from at least two years are" Girls, "says kaipalōviṭaja yauvana: samaya-pūrava in this common problem to deal with the author of the guide are also necessary".
Youth development is typical of the test of time.
Youth in the start of an argument about what he is, but when the breast before the age of 8 with the development of the two is the "it" bāla-parauḍha says.
In most cases, it will be a slow process - which will be stopped or hair from close to inspect the physician.
In the case of a more rapid progress by ēṇḍōkarā'inōlōjisaṭa ṭayūmarasa may need so that the prospects of serious problems or sisaṭa away as they could be.
If the māsika-dharama samaya-pūrava and other reasons for treatment to āyu-vr̥dadhi samaya-pūrava, which are the property of any stature and adult nāṭā as can be.
The drug, treatment or hōramōna sansatutiyāṁ for child's age, the rate of growth, growth rate, and depends on getting emotional.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaipalōviṭaja are cautious about drugs, "but accepted the youth, and to increase the vayavahārātamaka pressing issues from different girls feel they can".
The second major problem can be understood: that their parents do not want to just under the māsika-dharama's daughter.
Kaipalōviṭaja said, "they worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how it is made from sanitation rakhēṅgī".
The woman, who had a daughter of ten years was started in umarē such as, "it's the memory, was set back".
Even though there were signs of māsika-dharama and we had to talk about, but he was not emotionally prepared from.
He was so scared from his school and in his gajrani saheliyon her first menstrual cycle was started.
The causes of premature puberty in many suparacalita about principle.
However, there is no evidence that are certainly not of milk, or other chemicals in the environment, or in khādaya-padārathōṁ hōramōna yaunōmmukhī messages in the media could be accused of.
Even the boy - the same kind of girls - are getting samaya-pūrava youth.
This law is kaipalōviṭaja are the main reason for that is determined by the longest of this outbreak.
From 6 to 9 per cent in 2001; he has years to run on top of the girls in the study, which was to help the body fat is associates with the time of youth.
Other results support this decision to contribute, but there are also many of the other factors.
In this country, Hispanics and African-American girls leucasis aged in his youth before the tendency to get girls.
There are many explanations.
On a global scale, samaya-pūrava model of youth, ranging from economic conditions, weather and jeans, all things seem to have been influenced by.
Other pahēlī: though the boy's age, the face and hair of sex organs are getting in, but as well as the youth movements of the girls from them is not.
Ē.ē.pī. attending the conference of the subject other physicians jaṭilatāō̔ēṁ has endorsed.
Even in babies and young children are also to be seen muhānsē sex organs and hair is common.
George Jochnowitz Staten Island ēṇḍōkarā'inōlōjisaṭa cilaḍarēnsa gōrayēba in hospital in children's physician, Dr. Lawrence silavaramaina, says: "We are about it, is that we need to be careful in the youth living in the actual identity of the early years from how it was".
The parents for taking the opinion about this in my hair to take guidance from the physician must not be reluctant to talk about that from your children.
"It means kaipalōviṭaja suggested, before the expected time may be able to talk".
If your child is generally calm you will continue to respond properly.
Before the development of girls to be dilā'ē convinced that even if it is happening before time but it is part of normal life.

"with their child's parents of kids iṇṭarasēkasa aniradhārita sex can choose".
Germany became the first European Union country, which is unclear with sex organs for children in recognition of the third for sex.
Now the new man's or woman's rūḍhigata way children will not be specified.
According to the new law, parents of such children to sex, there is no need for them, the law is on the child's birth certificate "sex" or "unspecified" aniradhārita replies.
The aim of the new law to reduce the pressure on top of those parents who are related to the new liṅga-niradiṣaṭīkaraṇa surgery for children can take the decision hastily, and to fight against the discrimination of children from iṇṭarasēkasa.
According to BBC iṇṭarasēkasa after years of a man, who said, "I am neither man nor woman".
It was built by any of the doctors I also stained, be made.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year, according to this child, which is neither boy nor girl.
They are iṇṭarasēkasa, is part of a group of about 60 cases of sexual development disorders, which comes under an investigation which is unusual, it is the collective word vr̥ṣaṇa), (aṇḍāśaya jananagaranthi chromosome, or from regular use or used for sex.
It may be that we're iṇṭarasēkasa simapasana Wallis.
The gender identity is still believed to be from the United States, but most of the experts believe that when sex is so liṅga-niradhāraṇa may not have the best information available to specified to use surgery and, if it is, it is better to come into the child's psychological and physical development before you inspect.
In New York City, which Dr. Jack liṅga-pahacāna ḍarēśara a psychological expert in matters of security, he said that Germany's new law "is a great thing".
Children are iṇṭarasēkasa produce moral dilemmas.
He said, "Some people are in a position like parāṇa-saṅkaṭa for which require surgery, but most of it doesn't happen with children".
You can specify the same sex without surgery, and then see how that identity is growing.
No sex in a child will develop, to know how much of the science is not accurate.
No individual right about it may not answer why this happens.
It's a bit of a puzzle of why it is that people are gay.
In 2011 the European Commission's report has been filed before iṇṭarasēkasa ṭarānsajēṇḍara ṭarānsasēkasu'ala or people are described as different from the rest, because their case is related to sex but it is not related to the genetic, so long as it is clearly the man or woman, but so is jointly with both or neither is not clearly defined.
These features can display themselves are secondary sexual traits, such as the distribution of the muscles, breast, hair, weight of the primary characters, such as sexual and reproductive organs and lamabā'ī; jananāṅga; or in chromosomal structure and hōramōna.
The report by ṭarānsajēṇḍara iṇṭarasēkasa and jobs in the field to be faced with discrimination, harassment, and violence, and at the same time a bunch of offences which also gives him.
Now the linga-pitha gaira-anurūpa are special camp for the boys.
The people of Australia and Nepal has responded to his official documents, men, women or "third sex" has already allowed to mark.
In June, 52, Australian jīvana-parayanta mē-vēlabī nōrī, "unspecified" legal status and sex appeal has been to keep after winning the world's first "liṅgahīna mānyatā-parāpata" became the man.
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport in addition to iṇṭarasēkasa F-M89 or for X niradiṣaṭīkaraṇa as the third will be also.
France 24, according to the news report on the neighbouring country in France are still controversial issues associated with sex.
In 2011, as well as the strict Catholic from the country's books by dozens of French Sex from Antiquity tried "principle" signed on for back to the petition.
The website of US Catholic Online this Germany also opposed the law saying, "when the world is in a stage where the sex itself, the option chosen, but not sexual activity and two of the pillars of civilization, we are going in the opposite direction".
Also in mērīlaiṇḍa mom of the new-born baby children born from John said that he has to be specified at the time of sex will prefer to see.
He said about bringing on the website, "only without the additional limits parvarish is very stressful, especially if you do not even know what the sex of your child".
Children need stability and with certainty.
Historically, men and women who was born with two sex organs (ubhayaliṅgī) haramaipharōḍā'iṭasa children, which was called "the beautiful a-mgreek was bisexual in the name of God.
Less than a decade ago, and about, the slate in the sex medicine was considered as could be written, and then deleted.
But now there's a lot of people trying to challenge the moral of the surgery, they understand that it is a complex liṅga-pahacāna work, and sometimes even from doctors, who's not, they know that their children will do better than niradiṣaṭīkaraṇa about sex.
Ḍarēśara says "in the middle of the 20th century, it was called" "Emergency Psychiatry.
When these children were born, you called the psychiatrist, you don't invite the śalaya-cikitasaka.
The treatment of children with sex organs; the current theory about John haipakinsa University's Dr. John Money, which was presented by the sex suniramāṇanīya paradoxically-he.
He has created the word "gender identity" and argued that the social and environmental signal - parents of children - how do they do bring up the child's interactions with genes and hormones are determined by that it should be recognized as a man or as a woman.
In one case of the year, 1966, in which John / is known as "Joanne, their policies have become more controversial.
He's a child's (sarakamasiśana) liṅgāgaracarama-ucachēdana duraghaṭanāvaśa during sex, which was the sex of the child's parents that he complete his testicle for refusing the sterile and brought him like a girl.
Ḍarēśara money, said, "the case that in the case of avasathāntara successful people, but as he did so, he will not".
At the age of 15, as the man's child back in you and changed his marriage with a woman.
But, at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Some doctors still ḍarēśara said that "" follow the same model.
But in the year after year in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people with these sex through surgery has started to appear before "not happy" with the results.
The author of the same case mōnaṭānā 36, Jim Bruce, who was with the chromosome ēkasa.vā'ī. was born with male sex organs, but it was ambiguous.
As the doctors clear about whether or not it was a little sex, or he was great at bhagaśēpha, but was sure he was never going to be satisfied with life even as the man's "can't live".
So for some time of his birth in 1976 after surgery, Bruce and part of the testicle and given out by parvarish like girl.
At the age of 12, given hōramōna woman.
He was from ABCNews.com said, "I know that I'm not the girl".
I was not happy, but it is very difficult to question.
In the age of 18, vaijā'inōpalāsaṭī was with him.
But unhappy and feel something wrong, he of the demand for medical records.
It turns out, it kind of reality.
The sterile at the time of birth I was - and never told me.
Bruce has ḍī.ēsa.ḍī., who was born with a sufficient amount of testosterone in his body, which would have prevented him from making the sex organs could not be developed from.
After knowing the truth, to return the doses of testosterone, he has become the man and given a democratically your breast.
Due to the surgery he became bān̄jha.
Today, he called Project organization interface iṇṭarasēkasa people in his perception about people in general to make explains.
But, the legal group kailīphōraniyā-ādhārita adhiśāsī cavā'isa ēḍavōkēṭasa for director of Annie ṭaimara-maiṭisa imphōramaḍa does concern that Germany was invited to mark and the law of "cipapī".
"Many people think that Germany ēkaṭivisaṭa law of the parents and child" aniradhārita speedy decisions "will inspire to specify".
We fear that this will encourage the intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, man's or woman's sex is better to specify the process.
But we don't know what kind of law that its role, so we can only guess nibhā'ēgā.
Australian ṭaimara-maiṭisa said that their organization is so as to support the law because "it's the adults go to recognize in the third sex".
He said, "legal adults about the sex of his own decision to be able to see in".
It is the law of Germany at the time of birth is related to specify.
This time it was to be fought by the new war on children is not.
On growing up, with his body can take the decision they are related.
But Dr. bārāṭaja rēḍiyōlōjisaṭa ēralīna of Pittsburgh breast which is the daughter of sexual development disorder, and hundreds of others in the group which helps support, said that Germany was both parents and children of law "will power".
Katy bārāṭajī's daughter was born with male chromosomes, but it was full ḍī.ēsa.ḍī. called asanvēdanaśīlatā ēṇḍarōjana syndrome.
Since the recipient was at fault in his ēṇḍarōjana, Katy developed female traits.
In his body, but life is so ḍimbagaranthi cervical or not.
And now, he married Katy pēnasilavainiyā; in the department of developmental psychology at the university.
Though he is, but he's taking bān̄jha godmein through sarōgēsī gēsaṭēśanala or expected to become a mother.
Bārāṭaja said, "it is the law of the parents that they would not make a decision on its own in haste".
"This man", they write, "or" women from by some test before and understand the time.
This kind of, you know, live - child parvarish love child.
You have and that is a particularly enjoy.
Hastily, we do not need not have such surgery which could not be back.
He said, "in the process of taking this decision brings children and parents free from anxiety disorder is inspired to do that because they do not believe that they are OK".
Eventually, the child will determine how she is more comfortable with sex -- and this is a really good thing.
This is a decision for the children in their own enables.

This time we have been warned that ī.yū. as a condition of membership of the European free travel in the region to join as an independent Scotland would need.
At passport control and haiḍariyana baravika pitched on the walls of the string of stories about the border.
The truth is that the rest of Europe has saṭaraithakalā'iḍa departs with the papers of the Independent described about possible economic benefits, though - as well as to predict - not in hēḍalā'insa to describe it.
Nor have any member ī.yū. explains that most of their time was spent in the formal rules need to change.
Scotland is not with the Schengen area, also from Scotland in Brussels who really wants to do it, in return for cheap will be concessions in Brussels gaira-anupālana continued.
So, then, a-kahānī.
And so many of the things that fell from a long time, he will be the first of those I was. "" meaning of freedom is passport control bēbuniyāda had listened to the news about 40 years ago.
Yet again, the story of this interesting story with has been lost in the price.
Also, independent Scotland to Europe than biḍiṅga of why there should be?
Why do yōka Brussels of London to be domestic, especially now?
Here is the real European news: Europe's great yudadha-paśacāta, plan to eventually stopped.
With the euro crisis, Europe project has officially dead.
In the whole ī.yū. ī.yū. to oppose or to close down the euro currency as dedicated to getting more than party.
Even in Germany, the party alaṭaranēṭiva yūrōsakēpaṭila for Germany - which has been the same this year - coming back in September federal election generated about fifty million votes, and this is how the Free Democrats of the their (hamārē libaas samatulaya) ḍēmasa buṇḍēsaṭaiga out from effectively.
The plan to create a federal Europe is always of the same domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis has proved the radical parivaratanakāraka.
Berlin and the European Central Bank followed by strict rules, with the currency through the practice of national economies because of obstacles has been installed on many people, is also to think that the European project is a distant place.
That's too much national governments in the budget of the bureau, was not part of the crisis was much more - in the case of Greece, only the truth.
The bureau, but the system has its members in favour of German exporters, the currency exchange rate has been stable - which is something you want to keep German politician.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe than in Germany you can minimize damage to the underlying position of the productivity which finds himself in.
Is the only way the salaries and reducing public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
On budget and currency problems is further than from deep European productivity points.
Consumers at the expense of French and German energy allows firms to provide - has been installed by Brussels "green" energy policy as a result, European industry compared to the United Nations for electricity and gas to four times for double payments.
It's going to do damage to punjab-hamstrung quantum. garaiṅgēmā'utha people, in which we have already seen.
Everyone in the world, also froze wages be pēṭarōkēmikalasa European industry from cheap US gas to be affected by the Shell can't save.
The result has been a sense of people come in, particularly in France, which was the main ī.yū. fans.
After France's top politicians yūdadha has to regulate the ī.yū. Germany, and Paris in the world to provide equal vānśigaṭana billing was seen as a solution.
But now the political legitimacy of Berlin as the Passport to Paris, and there is no need for it's own economic policies on Europe, of which apply ḍagamagā France's economy.
Result: the right wing in the opposite of Marine Le Pen, the National Front has recently ī.yū. upacunāva in third place in the ruling Socialist dhakēlatē victory on Nov.
In front of this by France with 24 percent of the votes of the British Labour Party - this is the most popular yathāsamaya for warning that they can't do this as they are left to right, the disruption for hēāgā advantage only for automatically.
Lee Penn a-mfrench white, working class in the middle of what to do with his new found fame?
The next year, the party has used ī.yū. ī.yū. elections in the European Parliament wants to create a common currency, rival groups.
Even if, as is possible in this election, opposition ī.yū. do so well this type of group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: 'common opponent and soon in Europe ī.yū. confluence of hatred towards the euro currency will.
The Bureau will not be completely (samparabhu) retail ", but it is of a Europe of Nations", which will reach back as General de Gaulle would support.
Germany and some of which can assist the bureau arathavayavasathā'ēṁ to France and southern Europe, coins, but will start again.
I expect that in the U.S. with the hope of an entitlement najadīkiyāṁ himself away from the project.
However, the increasing of interest in the Pacific vānśigaṭana indicate that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen after these most of Scotland?
We made little (āvaśayaka) in the region of England can choose to live.
Or we can protect its own economic interests - including the Brussels and Berlin are at the right time to tell for separation is included.
I think that's a better Scotland as a member in the European system is loose, provided that we can keep their own currency.
The same thinking gaira-saṅghīya of other countries in Europe with the United Nations will make it easier for work.
Otherwise we are walking on the road of Norway to maintain its economic independence when they should.
Ulalēkhananīya ēsa.ēna.pī. government in Scotland - in Europe - as well as the most successful mitavayayitā-virōdhī political campaign, which has been proposed by Labour's Chancellor Darling ēlisaṭēyara kariyānvita) -lrb- and to oppose the cuts, and then on the basis of ḍēma ṭōrī-liba alliance won a majority in 2011 was a surprise.
This time for Scotland to vote for independence in the making, because in that case it will be imposed by Berlin and Brussels will have to accept the rules of parsimony.

What's the upper classes of Europe for Britain is ready to do business with?
In April, the business for the Britain launch.steve and a business and it was determined that of the entitlement to employment and prosperity of our relations with the manufacturer ī.yū. also want to see what changes have been made.
We made him Britain's business is the largest and most detailed survey of nētr̥tavakaratā'ōṁ held ī.yū. asked him how to do business with their lists of what.
The idea has 1000 nētr̥tavakaratā'ōṁ yū-gōva business for commercial size of Britain, which, by the way, are representative of areas and places.
This survey's conclusion can be surprising to many people.
We found that a big part of businessmen now wants to export out of Europe, and wants to concentrate on those countries, which are modern and growth, while static ī.yū. by member countries.
They want the government of countries like China, India and Brazil to give priority to relations with the new business, not the long-term reform of the chamber ī.yū. institutions ulajhī confused and in the process.
When the product is regulated by monopoly, ranging from specific policy areas, such as law, they ask about the most crucial of these was of the opinion that the business of nētr̥tavakaratā'ōṁ qualifications should have come back under the control of Westminster.
A single market with common discontent was very quickly, as can be seen from the businessmen in Brussels says that the value of the regulation of Europe's trade benefits to be made of the former is by far the highest - who even large European companies that are traditionally, 40 percent were in favor of it.
And in the end, the most commercial nētr̥tavakaratā'ōṁ as our survey found that a big part of it, as is clear from Britain with ī.yū. instead of politics, business and treaty relations based on the way of change.
Of course, the main conclusion that we saw in the levels of groups, has shown that a businessman, "inspired by" meaningful change in the direction of the entitlement, which lost its power back.
It is a high price for Britain - treaty changes and to get a better deal in the referendum issue, ī.yū. existential expediency in 16 percent of the vote in favour of change.
The prime minister must be not in doubt in this survey is of significance that the British businessman, on the terms of the membership of Britain ī.yū. talks of his plan to support.
Of course, it also shows that the balance of power in favour of the current entitlement to a meaningful and to change the expectation of punaḥvāratā.
A better deal for British business is possible, and it is very fast, because the euro economy, supported by fiscal and step out in the direction of the Union.
Surely the priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as our survey's conclusion for vayavasāyiyō show that this means a new focus on meditation and the business of fundamental change in kārayapadadhati regulated by Brussels.
