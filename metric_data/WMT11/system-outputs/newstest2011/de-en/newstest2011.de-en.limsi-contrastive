What should they do the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei."
The new Ratsherrs of capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously have to overcome some language barriers, with their alt-neu colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and city representation at all able to understand.
The newspaper Aktuáln.Cz members of the new Council of SSD times a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious slang that has become common practice in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague have been at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, it became clear that the new councils in relation to these new terms somewhat in the dark.
They say that, at least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Luká Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes."
But it is also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
As an example to the term "golf hole."
"This is the only expression of which you are presenting me here, I occasionally use."
"Otherwise, I do not think a lot of slang."
From the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuáln.Cz in this year's June before the electoral congress of the ODS was published, the editors pickte six concepts, it turned out, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague government.
The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole," "go in the Konditorei," " nacken ," " betrayal of the capital " and " verblechen " define.
Three Prague Ratsherrs agreed the test on the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the meeting, then less than the listeners.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, the test was rejected from the outset.
"These things have given me no matter how the Civic Democrats and chatting with each other about it, I am not passing judgement."
"I think it is important, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, would have been Luká Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly not recognized by the influential businessman and friend of the Ex-Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janouek of the speech.
The term "Voldemort," Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word he was erriet correct on the test, "the main Prague golf hole."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, to safety but added: "But the more I know from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I am probably a language course requirement."
The "golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the Environment Luká Plachý right as a Blanka tunnel through the entziffert.
Both Social Democrats but also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luká Plachý idea even where to find this character, and thereby also what it means, "to go in the Konditorei."
"I think that is to say, to go into any Prague catering industry" is pretty Plachý close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the seat of Janoueks firms.
However, in line with Březina but he claimed that this knowledge is more likely to have accessed from the newspaper, than for him this vocabulary would own.
According to the Testteilnehmern judging by, it seems really under the Social Democrats have no similar popular slang.
"I asked my colleagues as well, but obviously there is something we are really not."
"We call upon us by name, occasionally even using words or colorful names," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínský - of his party peers loosely "Hulda."
"I was in school Bíza (Birke) called, but I do not know whether my colleagues also called" Karel Březina tells us his nickname of.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.Cz has tried out the name and behold - he works.
Weinert councillor for the party allies and friendly "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "old" Representative Miroslav Poche before the elections by activity in the party sponsorship drew attention from some colleagues "Igráek" (renowned Czech do figure) mentioned.
Colorful names as the only the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance permit.
Hulínský, it may not be alleged if it "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.Cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname of "doctor Gummiknüppel-Rechte" was supposed to do that Petr Hulínský its title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants the use of torture " witches have ' stop and gave a brochure, it turned out
Women in Burkina Faso are being branded witches, usually some common social characteristics.
They include more of the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women is becoming a witch ," they will be strictly isolated, so that the rest of the village cannot be dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Remains too young and healthy women have been spared this, because they help the work and bear children," an investiture nurse describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim care for more than 100 women who were expelled from their communities.
Now, the local government decided against these abnormal "social action" to crack down.
And it was for this reason, a brochure, it became clear that the "persecution" should stop.
But the issue was a snag.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read" instructed the newspaper "derStandard" towards the dilemma of the written enlightenment.
The witchcraft to be accused but also in other African countries commonplace.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, was the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men were tortured to death - they fanned them with kerosene and burned them.
Reported this incident, including the server BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed the matter would only have been a coincidence unfortunate circumstances.
Your version says that oil is inflamed, which will be used to ritual Salbungen.
And, after the group tried, "an evil spirit" of the woman "good health."
The isolation of "witches have" support the people here without any regard for their education.
"The Standard quoted in this regard, a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso:" fresser the inside of human souls in the past, as they are today a threat, " he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso, at least to efforts to defuse the witch hunt, the gambia president in the past year, the President himself properly mitgemischt.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt, since these alleged share of their death had and would now try to also kill the President himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called Schamane to help the Middle Guinea, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard indiscriminately arrested women and men forcibly kidnapped from gambia villages and brought to the farm of the President in Kanilai," led the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink a Absud with halluzinogener effect from plants, but also your gut and Nierenprobleme reaction.
Two of the arretiert people survived the stay on the farm is not.
It was only because of international pressure were almost a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: it fuels in the stove - still pays higher rent
An elderly untersetzter man leaves just the client center of the society RPG Byty the 'Kohlebarons' Zdenk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm of a commemorative envelope with three new leases on three houses: on their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who has just served a prison sentence.
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" has just increased the rent.
So, instead of 3 500 kronor monthly miete is the son next year on a 2 room home with kitchen fork out £3.3bn 4100 kronor in the second category.
"There are less than fluid in the house hot water and heat must be in a simple carbon," he angrily tippt a finger at the new lease of the son, whose signature he a power.
"But what - signed and I," he explains half and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.Cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts are not easy to sign up and until 7 December to wait, in which it intends to publish a guidebook, as it fights against such contracts.
But the man only is dismissive.
"One says that the others," he makes a grim face.
The region of Ostrava as the great "deregulation laboratory."
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants pay no rent market.
Aktuáln.Cz therefore decided that this "laboratory" on a personal visit.
The RPG-Warteraum Havíov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning packed on this Tuesday.
The Bodyguards are right beside the door of a security agency and an aufruf machine.
"Rent 2011," stands as a special Tastfeld on the touch screen.
In a nutshell touched upon by and already spuckt the device with a numerical list.
We hardly have the number "157" entziffert and already piepst them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting period.
Half a minute later in the series.
A little later, an older couple walks into the waiting area, in order to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting area apparently does not apply at all the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - Reparaturanträge, Versicherungsangelegenheiten and similar.
From the middle of November fly over the region Ostrava Kuverts with the new leases most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty beats them in the letter, a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent.
The specific date for the new rent in the client centre is opened for the 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, which is to say, that is only the beginning" to answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former Bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections was the parliamentary Vice-President originating from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek SSD quite loudly taken up this issue, no wonder, then, that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years, I want a new bed from them."
"It is not even look at besch. WC-Brille they could change" makes the aforementioned man air.
Until now, according to the staff are all pensioners on the counter in order to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenants' moderation, which promises them RPG if they have the specific requirement to sign in time.
In the enjoyment of a half reduced February miete should also get the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December to sign.
Until now, "deregulation" in Havíov but everything else, as an overloaded of enquiries.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here" appreciate the schalter beamtins.
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual rental agreements where necessary.
If the parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as the information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," RPG said on its website.
"Nobody here goes to court," says a staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her, at least partly right.
"I have 13 (Sweden kronors) pension, of which I left for dinner 5, where I should get the money for a legal dispute," he says.
Then the employee is uncertain.
"Time to see."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people prefer to wait and see," it must be borne in mind.
The regulated rent ends in the main part of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day of 2011 and RPG Byty, according to the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not enough times to the maintenance of the housing funds from" argues Pavel Klime, the director of the society Wohnungs-Portfolios RPG Byty and - just to criticize the neglect of the angry tenants of the Housing Fund, according to the homeowners of the main reason for the rent hike.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from one's rent four billion could be invested in the houses in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
In the broadsheet LCD-Display on the ceiling over the polster sessels in the waiting area of Havíov in the meantime, there are always a few red shining information.
"The rent increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"This means that whenever a maximum 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD-Monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases is the increase of extreme lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
In 2600 housing remains the rent on the same level in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation of the rent is not erratic in pushing up but staged within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposed an additional duty: all revenue from the rent increase (see graph) wants to keep putting the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation.
But - and this should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent hike.
The architects saw a - for the office includes a kindergarten
The office buildings in Brno Avriopoint Arch is the new headquarters of the company. The design.
But who would have expected a mini nursery, with all it entails: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground at the foreign terrasse.
This nursery is the staff of Arch since last year. Design available.
The Projektierungs and architectural office Arch. Design, which Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner works come from the first drafts of the new buildings Avriopoint with the premises for his Firmen-Minikindergarten.
In example, foresight, because most of its 90 employees (the inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is keen to ensure that the project of counterterrorism offices and both men and women to return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Along with the opportunity to work shorter, the nursery is another bonus, the Arch. Design to its employees in the concept of their social programme has to offer.
The Bauingenieurins and architects' internally, so it is easier to her demanding career and child care to reconcile.
The mini nursery is an original idea of the staff (the inside) of Arch. Design and with the support of the management succeeded grants from the European Union and the ministry for work and social affairs to win for her project.
The professional mini nursery through the operational programme of human resources and employment policy through the European Social Fund and financed from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to 2.8 million CZK) could be obtained the necessary facilities and equipment, and for the duration of 2 years for qualified staff and provided for the operation.
According to the absorption of funds (2 years), the society Arch. Design obliged the mini nursery 3 more years will continue to operate at their own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year in right, with the society economy rating of actively aiding the application procedures.
In order to look after the children act qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the nursery school children can visit without age excessive restrictions, although most of them are more than three years old.
And because it is a mini kindergarten, at the same time must be present only 5 children, but the day alternate each other on several children.
The nursery business is flexible in tune with the needs of parents, children of all staff in relation to the use of the kindergarten the same rights - without any regard for the corporate hierarchy and their respective position.
Although there are individual education and care, the content in the mini kindergarten is comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children are not only that they will be particularly excellent teaching offered - from basic discoveries to pre-school education, by the way they still learn English.
The classroom is not just with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer available to the children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can at any moment, a look at the children and so accounts for the stress on the late collection of children from a remote kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working hours more productive.
Small wonder, then, that is also, of course, and loyal labour relations are emerging.
Arch. Design included as among the Czech companies a in the recruitment of new staff clearly benefits " offer family-friendly and through such programmes encourage their staff.
A bone chamber fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof looks like a prehistoric Echse, the back stairs, such as the vertebral column of dinosaurs and behind Fischmäuler.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local residents got the house with its organic forms the nickname of "bone house."
Organ forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and Mosaiks, which covered facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with fantastically lines lack paints and Texturen out to nature and living things.
It was only on closer inspection, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and conceptual order.
In the night still works against the whole facade of plastic, dramatic and specific Anleuchtung stepped up the glamour of the paint still.
The same buoyant lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave type of shaped wood frames, support Zierelemente by doors, even Gucklöcher and.
The Batlló house in the district Eixample in the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia 43 arose from the renovation of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said.
The Americans took two years on the right and finished 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists, Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he ultimately voted Gaudís to the idea of converting to an unusual and even cheaper.
The rental house, Casa Batlló was an architect, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect, Josep Maria Jujol together.
The Dekorations have been created for the ceremonial home to some of the Realitätenbesitzers and even the use of Mosaiks in the facade was his idea.
At the design of the facade but also many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
This Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House, Casa Milá in Güell Park, in which other works also located by Antoni Gaudí.
Not long after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames for "bone house."
Others called it the specific window opening mechanism for the "yawning home."
It also says that on top of the building was the sword in the holy Georg, presented by the Patron of Catalonia.
But also other bildhauer elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí was an architect of the House a unique central heating system for the time with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kamins.
It is a little bizarre is its 45 degrees inclination already.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all former building codes and in no way anyone could be discouraged by this.
Before start, he was one of the relevant permission from the city but the information presented by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers in the completion of two years later were so appalled by the outcome that they change the situation demanded.
The Ratsherrs were also among other things, that the building with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk.
Among the changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the relevant request of the district asked Josep Batlló a request for approval of the property of the two highest situated floors of the House - and it has given him promptly.
The homeowners themselves pulled into the lower floors one.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company showroom, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor has been leased to a juwelier business.
The entire sechsstöckig building is going through a set of stairs up to the dachte race.
The basic elements of the reorganization were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by bent and waved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to the mutual connection between rooms.
The social part is quite connect through the opening of the Salontüren and so could comfortably chatting, without a major society in vertraulich more talks will have to give up on a certain intimacy.
The House received by Gaudís restructuring, apart from a new facade is also an unusual roof and two other floors.
It is also a formidable Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasiert Kachels with which the courtyard is dressed and Lichthofs.
The game of those two colours gives all the floors of the House a maximum amount of light.
In doing so he became simply the principle that white light reflects better than dark colors, the sunlight on the contrary absorb.
The house, Casa Batlló, the 2005 was included in the welterbe list of Unesco, everyone can now visit.
In the first floor is the apartment made available to the public geräumigste and prächtigste.
The homeowners chosen first in the year to this step, and the cause of the 150 birth day of famous writers.
When we found out that this is a fairly lucrative business reserved the inspections, so they also extended to other common and Dachgeschossräume, including the dachte race.
The price for the inspection of the monument is not a small thing, he stands at 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 per cent reduction.
This figure surpasses the entry price to other gaudí estates in the city.
Who the real atmosphere of the House, with its drache door mchen would like to know, should seek friendship with one of the domestic residents to close and put him on a visit home.
The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other aspirations than men
It is not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface - mattress and make a good bed.
However, this must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things in the choice to play a role - the weight, size, health, and last but not least, the sex of the Schläfer.
Equally important is the Interieur mattress and subordinate.
A typical example?
In a weekend house, which is not heated on a regular basis, Latexmatratzen are not good, because they need a lot longer, "hot."
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen.
And - they should be turned on a regular basis.
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the heart, and still to lie on a solid record humidity, the movement: it is not excluded that is emerging from its mold.
In the election, of course, also plays a role in which it is used.
Anyone who wants a longer period of time was abroad, where very high Matratzes with soft layer are normal, hard on a low mattress with hard surfaces can get.
"Benefit all ice-hockey player who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep very well here."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, Fersen and Hüften they simply need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)."
"I would recommend this including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that the" information "from the joints and the skin can receive bad," said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in polster möbel.
That is why I have a few years ago many ice-hockey players, but also other customers these Matratzes with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam) concerned.
"Today, this is not a problem any more, because those Matratzes offers, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And we should not necessarily be a famous ice-hockey player, in order to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaums.
This "miracle" works really quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert its severity and type in accordance with the absorbed heat, or in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body.
There's nowhere else in the night shifts go around like after a heavy battle.
It simply sleeping a lot better.
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against Dekubitus (fire).
With the election of the matratze size to body size, we should still include the length of the sohles, then approximately 21 to 34 inches.
Men like Mrs of the 180 cm wide, so need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the Schläfer should be at least 90 cm of width available together so 180 cm.
In single beds, for example in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
Furthermore, a comfort and, for the sake even for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following thumb for the ideal bed band: "If it is on the back, should still have enough room for the easy angewinkelt to be poor," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the zunft model of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, who for many years the issue of healthy sleep and devotes the ergonomics of furniture and this issue also presented at technical schools.
In a double bed needs every one of his own and his own bed, but be careful with the purchase, so that the Matratzes are equally high.
Other than that, nothing else other than the Rosts to assembling in differing degrees, and that is not long on each bed frame possible.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 inches high, mattresses with stroke skelett 15 inches of it should be at least three centimetres accounted for formal classes and fine cushion.
"With the hand or in the Hinsetzen you can feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a special Rosttyp.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together increased Siamzwillinge in the bedroom to find nothing.
These Matratzes are not strip and you can't wash, which is already commonplace.
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0,75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why experts reject Werbeslogans Matratzes a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promise.
Each thing has its if and buts.
So a practical advice from the dealers: when Matratzes of 120 or 140 cm diameter should be the hygiene of the waschbar, abziehbaren salary will not be afraid, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, you can wash and drain slightly.
Even if today the rule Matratzenbezüge made with Rundumreißverschluss, so that you get two sides after the opening (immensely important for the washing process, and the waschmaschine size!) is the manipulation with larger Matratzes, especially alone exported, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They have to sleep on, rather than a solid record of a Rostes?
Order!
Or, at most for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should be labelled the record would rather Lüftungslöchern (if already are not included) and mattresses with stroke skelett and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pocket stroke nucleus and fine cushion use.
Polyurethan-Matratzen belong to such a document is not.
For not verstellbar latte rosts with 14 to 18 stroke play (Lamellen) Latex or sand emphasis mattresses suitable (possibly even combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a major latte number, then 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in the lende area and the ability to regulate the latte härte.
At verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include Matratzes with relevant skelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts.
In addition to the suspension of the Steife stroke play will be offered particularly flexible modules.
This is a particular stroke play, enabling the stroke play einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they allow the occasional Einsinken from the back of the Schläfer.
For men with wide shoulders an important matter.
There are even matratze makers, which started with "Beatles' mattresses" soft zones to use for the shoulder area.
I also thought about the ladies - they might be this soft zones in the Hüftgegend.
For demanding customers are scoring load large guidance systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with scoring burden Kontakt-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung certain.
The pressure will be distributed on several points, which reduces tension.
But - if you're on the right mattress and correct a bad (too big and fülliges) head bed used to get the most benefits will be lost.
Here too a thumb: a bed should be based on the head, its leaders should only go to the shoulders, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax.
The ideal seems a 50 x 60 cm wide cushion, as for example the Scandinavians might.
In the situation should head bed (along with the discharge zone in or the soft zone in the bed) to compensate for the shoulder height.
Something our modern Matratzes with the former (with hay filled) Strohsäcken but common.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Even Matratzes is the new magic word "bio."
Instead of Erdölrohstoffen used for the manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturell oils - for example Rizinus and soya oil.
Soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers.
"Bio says in Matratzes, her heart is pure natural materials," said Petr Vaíek of the company Tropico Plus.
Naturstoffe are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - was one of the first Aloe Vera.
You can also kapseln the spread of fresh wood or Lavendelduft in sleep, Mr. President.
Here too it makes a difference between man and woman.
While the men a "cooling in the existing" plant extract from birke sheets will be used, so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "current mend" impact.
Extracts from Red Paprikaschotes stimulate the blood circulation to the weaker sex is wohlig hot during the sleep, Mr. President.
And the current favorites?
Mattresses of foam may (he has more Pores with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than normal Polyurethan and also much more flexible).
The combination of the various Steife (toughness) arise from Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen who know exactly where head, hip and Fersen are located.
For a quality mattress, however, has 7 000 kroner and more to fork out £3.3bn.
Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower value-added tax, because they are considered to be medical assistance.
As the first Czech companies this advantage Gumotex has been given.
You can see on the bed and on to save is not so easy.
Every now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses on the price of an offer.
For example, the trademark offers the mattress Duofreeze Magniflex in verstepptem Visco-Schaum Memory 11 990 CZK.
The second you get for free.
It was the material Tempur the era of the viskoelastischen foam with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed.
Small wonder, then, they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are subjected to enormous excess loads on the landing.
Tempur is a soft warmth, entrenched in a cool environment again.
For example, it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimum manner the physical pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of printing brandy, but generally increased the sleeping comfort.
Viskoelastische foam but not only Matratzes but also for other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and will provide the equipment relief.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to Menschen-Überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control
The fear for one's children is growing more and more parents, so consider them via GPS to monitor.
The system, originally invented on the tracing of cars is equally good people, which would also be helpful in such cases, such as recently in the mysterious disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
The device is about as big as a cigarette packet but soon it should be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people in the case of the missing Anika in fear and funk, and so do the ways to better protect their children.
Even for the price of a deterioration of their privacy.
"We try to tell everybody that this is by no means be overlooked is spying on, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes on top of the tragedy," leads Petr Pilin of the society Macro because one of the suppliers of GPS-Ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I admit that it is in the unique to the abuse of such devices will be able to come, for example, when someone it is steeped in the pocket, without that it knows, but we have had no such cases have been recorded."
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," adds Pilin to add.
In his opinion, the child but always know what the purpose of the "box" and how they are being used in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologin Dana Boková, however, suggests that a child, if such a thing may not wear his simple emptied.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately lose certain things, if they do not want to be controlled."
"Even from the mobile phones set initially great expectations with the parents, but they are just as easy as this new surveillance equipment," says Ms. Boková.
In your opinion, is also a contentious issue, whether such a body would help in the event of an actual attack.
"The kidnappers on planned kidnappings controlled virtually always, whether the child any electronics, with which it could be located."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"If such monitoring devices wider use, they would also seek them, because their sales would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
But she acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile may be helpful.
Roberta ech of the society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services both for automobiles, as well as for people offering, can the existence of this kind of equipment to help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The machine is really stop the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least, is the last position of the person at your disposal."
"When we integrated more expensive equipment is actually a neigung knife, which is to say, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos breaks, the device instantly sends a warning under indication of the position," claimed Mr. ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also smart mobile phones with navigation perform, you need only a einzuspielen special software.
The problem with the current positioning tools is that either it is equipment in streichholzschachtel size, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones.
As always there is the risk that they will lose.
Mr. Pilin of the Macro because, according to test it in the present devices look like normal Digitaluhrs.
"This has the advantage that the possible aggressor must realise that not even a surveillance or radar gear.
"Or he can see the first after a certain period of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter what direction the development - towards tags or trailers, still using the same technology as the vehicle tracking.
So the combination of radar function with the help of the GPS-Systems (as in Ms. in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which operates the current position.
The army has so many Zündschnurs that the whole of the Czech Republic umwickeln, you might consider but only for two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometers Zündschnüre bought with weapons.
In the year before, the Defense Ministry had 224 kilometers Zündschnur delivered to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years.
The problem is just the durability of the Zündschnur - two, at most, but four years.
The army bought the Zündschnur company STV Group, others for paltry 40 million kronor.
In his explanatory memorandum for the purchase of these huge amount Zündschnur said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually consume about 60 kilometres Zündschnur.
According to the research by Armeepyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES to show for this indication that the whole army annually should undertake an intensive pyrotechnics training - by all the generals and officers of the army command, right up to the Sekretärins and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could be considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length corresponds 25 000 Detonationen.
But even this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
But if even the old rule of experts that every new professional soldier for training two metres Zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by those Neueinkaufs - also under the point of view of the increased needs of pioneer and special teams - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned created 225 years.
It complained soldiers of the Rapid Border Intervention Brigade recently in the Defence Minister Vondra, they had almost no look for hand-held weapons more so that Schießübungen the lack of resources are limited due to strong.
From the same shortage demure.
"I am also not a why it from us to buy those legions of Zündschnüre."
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, we, as traders want concessions to as much as possible," says the marketing manager of the STV Group, Jan Dcký.
Jan Pejek, the spokesman of the Defense Ministry justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur, so that the army would have been at least ten years with this "ammunition" acknowledges the covers.
Jan Dcký of the STV Group, but only talks about a four-year span of the Zündschnur and the police and Armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago.
"In a perfect storage is also possible the four mentioned a number of years," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, as a soldier not accused the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the period of any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not in vain, but costs further money.
Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantitative rebate for 445 kilometers Zündschnur.
"It cost us 60 per cent less than any year supply of 244 miles," Pejek spokesman us shares with the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
It is only by way of comparison: the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Army, liquidate exceeds some years barely 1 500 metres.
And the police are always ordered such quantities of these weapons, which they still can use before the end of the term of use.
It is wonderful for the safety of the Pyrotechniker, so it also considers the possibility of flexible procurement of more modern and hence reliable Zündschnurs open.
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak People's Army on their campaign was on the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES of the Czech armed forces, expected in a few years ago, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnurs, which they now as "favourable."
To this day I get situated the contacts I have gained thanks to competition
The victorious placement in the competition, "small businessman of the year," Luká Pytloun helped his hotel in the sale of the franchise.
The winner of the last year of the competition, "small businessman of the year," Luká Pytloun was carried out by Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luká Pytloun like to travel.
He was aware only abroad, that it carried out by Liberec lacks good excess accommodation at reasonable prices.
For the savings from his vacation to work abroad, and with the help of a bank loan, he erstand a dilapidated house with five homes.
Bearing in mind that he then university student in the sixth term was, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The former price quality ratio angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luká Pytloun.
The first home he vermietete foreign workers.
According to the whole asset he immediately reinvested back into the house, which he then step for step towards retirement with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then, it managed in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity carried out by Liberec four pensions, two fair restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds in all housing categories to open.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the four star Hotel " Pytloun design hotel. '
This year was another first-class hotel added on.
"It is, we have a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé signed, we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties have already reported on the Pytloun-Hotels franchise," says the entrepreneur Number One last year.
"A large proportion of the licence for the operation of the hotels had just the victory in the competition" entrepreneur of the year ," Mr. Pytloun adds.
The victory has given him greater fame, popularity tabled in carried out by Liberec and environment.
"The people saw me on the street, even at this late stage, they often congratulated me and I must say, that was good," he remembers.
I commend all those who really want to create something to participate in this competition.
It does not equal to gain any visible is good.
He says that he is so far from the contacts and acquaintances benefits, which otherwise would not come at all.
"With some of the people I met, thanks to the competition, I think until now regular business relations."
The fame associated with the success is his opinion, a little at each of its staff in which they live.
And since he has 70.
"I notice them more loyalty and pride that they are a little part of the general recognition."
I see this actually not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of good work for all of us."
"My name is just something in the forefront," says Luká Pytloun modest.
Do I wish an easier year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his single-mindedness has Farmet the worst is behind.
According to the price of the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year over the past year, Karel árský, Farmet, contrary to the company's owner.
The jury then commemorated the effort with which he eská Skalice from the small Werkzeugbau stampfte a company from the ground, hundreds of millions of sales power.
"I can say that this appreciation not only myself but also encouraged all my staff and our self-confidence has been reinforced in the battle with the competition," says the previous winners.
The starting point of the corporate history of Farmet the effort to do something useful.
And when his father, Karel, then the state árský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists offered a small garage to rent, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company, in which he was employed until then free-fall and with a few friends of his father, a separate company for the manufacture of plastic wannes.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic Presses across central Europe.
But only by the success in this competition and its median idealization, she happened into the consciousness of the non fachöffentlichkeit.
"Not only for our customers to the brand Farmet is now clearly more intense exercise, including our foreign partners began the fact of being able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in her country to attach greater value," says Karel árský.
Last year, when Farmet was not only in the sign of the euphoria.
The celebration was preceded by the economic results of the company in 2008 and a portion of 2009.
Indeed, 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of raw bauprodukten.
The crisis, which was then less people, but above all enterprises, just reached its climax - many firms have been forced to suspend their investment projects and the purchase of new facilities and technologies to limit.
"This situation, of course, we could not escape as well."
"The turnover went about 40% back, we had to limit the production and even resort to layoffs," said Karel árský
A viable businesses must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it was impossible to get a grip on the situation and to keep the company in the black, albeit with lower profits than before the crisis.
When the company was not prepared to make cuts - for investment in research and development.
"For the grant, we entered a research and training centre, we bestärkten our presentation at international trade fairs and procured main prices for domestic exhibitions," says árský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again, and with them the number of new employees.
"According to the new winner, I wish you much joy of victory - but more calm" leaves Karel árský gear.
An opinion poll, removing the nonsensical rules
The poll by the "absurdity of the year" for the fourth time part of the business competition.
Some unreasonable rules already managed to create from the world.
On the dubious winner of the next year of the poll "absurdity of the Year" has the duty to provide documents to authorities available online.
Thus decided more than a third of not quite four thousand voting abgebe built by the entrepreneurs.
For example, the social insurance administration demanded a paper auszug from the trade register, even if it had been the official can be accessed by two click of a mouse.
Thanks to the poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech social insurance administration will in future control of Sozialversicherungszahlern no longer require extracts from the register," led the SSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraová.
Sense and purpose of the poll "absurdity of the year," it is under the microscope all rules and orders to comply with the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and lift the unreasonable.
This is the year for the fourth time part of a business competition, by the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) will be held and enjoys a growing popularity in the eyes of the public.
If in the last year of three thousand people took part in the vote this year, there were already four thousand.
Small wonder, then, because there is still a lot of statutory obligations, the only and only serve to hamper business activity.
"What, for example, the number of Einkommenssteuerformulare are concerned, we are taking a front rank in the world, a" noted Karel Havlíek of the association of small and medium-size companies and sectors driving the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business in recent years, the stated aim of all governments.
Compared to the world the situation has hardly improved in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank will take in the Czech Republic in relation to the rank of a business conditions, as compared to a worse place for eight seats.
The competition of the year has been declared for the first time in the year, and plays each year for the same scenario.
Everyone can from April to the print of the competition at the end of September, notify administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
As regards the inscription serves the website address is invited. Firmaroku.cz. after that seeks the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "anti-pornography price" and leaves the public online on the website www.europa.eu.int. firmaroku.cz/ absurdita and www.europa.eu.int. ihned.cz vote.
It takes the one absurdity, which receives the most votes.
In order to this year's poll were already more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders registered.
The tips come not only from employers but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "via a list" of the competition are also a number of provisions, for instance, that maintenance vehicles on highways and rapid road tolls to pay or that employers with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets must vorrichten every two years.
The list of the year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The announcement of the competition each time at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a Happenings, which also regular people participate in the political and public life.
This year was, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-size companies and sectors driving the Tsch. Republic, and Petr Kuel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game.
"Where the state raises the employers stick between the legs, there can be no true economic recovery, so it is my goal every year for at least thirty paragraphs to lift the now entrepreneurs still unnecessarily complicate their operations," stated Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade.
The effort to create unreasonable orders from the rest of the world, to show effect.
In 2007 rankled people most entrepreneurs imposed duty, the Gewerbeamt in the place of its permanent company three days in advance will have to notify the intention with an exhibition subject to an exhibition or Kirmes drive to want.
This obligation has been lifted the force of a Gewerbegesetzes series.
The duty, which in 2007 received the second-largest number of votes - the duty, the Labour Office missions of employees amounting to 30 days of reporting, and it was through the law on them so-called "green card" abolished.
And - of all good things are three:
With regard to the absurdity of the 2009 regulation was elected, the physical therapists in the empty room with a mirror, a refrigerator and two Personenwaagen.
The health ministry, this regulation has been somewhat alleviated this year - fell on refrigerators requirement.
A new category validates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature in this year's already fifth year of the competition in the economic newspaper (HN) is the category ," responsible company by the year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sound and fair operation.
"We want to support these firms, which are the consequences of your business activities on the environment are aware and socially responsible initiatives to support," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, in the same way, as well as the "rebel of the Year" competition.
For the year's first vintage of this particular underclass in the main competition Vodafon company of the year firms signed up for the success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is very inspirativ and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they are in relation to the subject to distinguish their work, their efforts have yet a common denominator - support and respect.
What is at stake here, for example by gehandicapte people, since about personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the 14 year lists from the Czech Republic appeared so, for example, there the Prague software company Netera, which the emergence not formally promotes sports teams among their staff, who then participate in many tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo society, which has already spent seventeen years main sponsor of a trust fund for gehandicapte children.
Even a paper factory from Podbrady exemplary cares about their health disabled workers, which make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which they entitled ," responsible company in the region, Central Bohemia" acknowledged; Vodafone company in the competition of the year, they finished the third rank in the context of this region.
The victory in the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which, among other things, a fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week reduced working hours and that without a proportionate salary reduction.
The jury in the front ceremony also honorierte the fact that the company goes mainly in Czech manufacturers, citizens' groups supported in their surroundings and operates on green principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible about the consequences of our business and the administration to keep as low as possible for the environment," says its CEO Milue Ryznarová.
According to the Enlogit sound IT companies from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is located on the health of its staff and therefore they all books purchased ergonomische and Tastaturen, it also encourages its employees teleworking and corporate actions, they used Cartering-Dienstleistungen, which will be offered by a local sheltered workshop.
"We also support the foundation" people in distress ," the local Roma-Kommunität concrete aid," says Ondej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least is the activity of cleaning company 'Praní A itní' from the Karlsbad region worth noting their employees in the form of Extra-Bonussen will contribute to their pensions.
"We provide our employees contributions to the restaurant for the distances, in order to increase their skills and for the holidays," says Joseph Strapá of the construction company Czasch Bruntál, the winner in the mährisch Silesian region.
With regard to the category of the year, responsible company were automatically all the competition Vodafon district via a company registered in the year, the issues of the beantwortetet of the inscription showed questionnaire and by no later than the organisers until 15 August zuschickten.
Wrong or incomplete filled in the questionnaire responses were excluded from the organisers of the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing firms the unanswered questions, they were from the competition" in the year, responsible company "out of the question, in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, they were so but not disqualifying."
"A separate application only this competition is not possible, because he merely an underclass in the main competition company of the year," said Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Soil Fund - arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the land fund took in Pilsen anti-corruption police in recent days arrests.
It was the European media entrepreneur and property dealer Lubo G. Detektivs in handcuffs.
This was allegedly attempted a just underway public competition on the handling of ways claims to manipulate so that the land offered in the competition zufielen a concrete model.
This is Lubo G. paid half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police force, a person convicted of the offence of indecent activities pursued in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," other details in relation to the ongoing investigations, they could not provide.
Twenty-four hours later, the 46 year-old businessman has been released by the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can only speculate, given the paucity of official information.
The spokeswoman of the land fund Lubomír erná led to the matter of Právo, the police have in the Pilsner subsidiary body of the land fund actually arrests made and that during a public competition.
"It was a client and not one of our staff," she konkretisierte.
Had the public competition, according to Mrs erná, the correct term "call for tenders from demands for the transfer of land under the land law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants interest in the offered land bezeigen.
"These persons offer within the framework of the call for a higher value of their by transferring awaiting disbursement ways rights than the land value."
"In accordance with the offered claims will set the order in which the potential acquirer, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo G. were obvious information available to anyone who had registered on the invitation, and because he himself had the right person was because he had bought a number of ways claims, he offered a property interest that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance package.
It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his arrest such a large sum was.
Lubo G. was already in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund.
For example, he also played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Vaclav Sankota, a role which was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which already location decisions had been taken to construction.
At the time, Lubo G. from the land fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, more specifically, to the point where the construction of the magistrale pole Borské to the industrial area was planned.
He later exchanged this very favourable directly with the government against a house in the historic centre of the city that far exceeded the value of the land.
The town hall had to reluctantly small works not to endanger through the blocking of the land.
The households' housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January, the budgets must not only count with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with higher water and sewage charges and for district heating and rent in some places are also set to grow.
Families are so January several hundred kronor a month must learn from the wallet than in the past.
Electricity is expensive by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent or more in some cities, it will be up to a tenth more to pay for water supplies and in some places the district heating supplies too expensive.
The mere electricity costs housing budgets annually some 100 kronor.
The electricity prices were from all main suppliers reduced debt is therefore the clear support of the electricity production from renewable sources, notably for photographic voltaik plants.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this is accurate, then, if people have to heat up the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, again, with a few hundred kronor per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas across the Czech Republic will be more expensive, the prices for district heating different from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price rises.
This means that, for example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové on a monthly basis from January for district heating up to 50 kronor to pay more than 1 000 kronor per year to pay families in carried out by Liberec.
According to the residents of Prague, in turn, threaten 9% higher water and sewage charges and this in the event that the city increased infrastructure miete.
When the rent does not change, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price includes in Prague in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic, however, continues to be the lowest.
In the northern böhme, where prices already are among the highest, water and sewage charges will rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases for example in 140 000 Mietwohnungen expected in January, the so-called rent regulation.
Plans for example, the housing companies CPI Byty Ústí nad Labem owns 2 500 apartments, the rent from January to increase equal to 100%.
Anyone who disagrees with this rent hike, which the company wants to court.
The regulated rents are still paying nearly 300 000 homes, next year should rise by more than 10 percent.
Czech children appreciate with Fernet and rum, beer is out - simply has to slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for example, sometimes a good whisky, the father has stolen from the Hausbar.
These are the drinks, according to which enjoyed drunken Czech teenagers under 15 must be the most notbehandelt.
No exceptions are children, their hangovers repeatedly have ausschlafen in the hospital.
This emerges from the experience of the doctors facing similar cases in the opening of Kinderabteilungen clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it simply takes too long to be drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludk Pelikán, the chief surgeon of the paediatric department at the Central Bohemian clinic Hoovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle from the Hausbar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can be blended with Juice, then he smells not so strong," said the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the Fakultätskrankenhauses Motol Eva Jurinová him right.
"Usually we are talking about Fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trends, notably on basic education."
"Occasionally, there was slivovice one walks from home," Mrs Jurinová.
Pelikán chief surgeon, thirteen or fourteen years of drinkers in the hospital photograph long no anomaly.
Before the clinic in Hoovice, in which he has been working since this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie department of the hospital Motol by profession, where ambulances angetrunken students from public transport and contribute produced.
"A girl had to be four times are."
"Your career, they began 12 years ago, when it is the first time with 3.5 mg of alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" Extase "was the crunch provides," the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"It was in the exhibition site in Holeovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that not even their mother, it was odd that her daughter 48 hours was not home," wonders why the chief surgeon.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in use with one's offspring is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism from children.
In order to have a genuine addiction in the true sense of the word experts say, children do not.
"Under alcoholism is a longtime chronic dependence on alcohol, together with all the related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children."
In those who enjoy repeated alcohol is mostly a negative familiär of social background characteristic," explains Pelikán chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, according to Ms. Jurinová, until the middle of November approximately 40 drunken children hospitalised in the local department of children and youth medicine.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which required a hospital, go in the statistics a.
Drunk children for ambulatory care of parents or possibly by the police to be brought home, will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children just like that, a bottle of spirits in the school bank austrinken, in the view of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal Amplitudes, on the 100%: Walpurgisnacht New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of bad testimony or joy at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnacht, I have also been seven drunken children experienced in the reception," stresses Dr Pelikán.
A drunken child spends the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off as a child in the next day only has to contend with a nasty hangover.
The headaches in the morning, then the may and the glucose deficiency can be in the hospital - with a liquid donation built by the Infusion with glucose and nährst open the organism lack drive.
"You are clearly better off, because after the" fabulous "experience in the evening, inspire them with good humour, without somewhere hurts."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán concedes, referring the patients sometimes, at least by the good humour to perish by giving them the costs are listed, it will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the ambulances and the night in an emergency bed well and like to come to a few tens of thousands of kronor.
"Every now and again I was used as an educational resources, if I direct the children was calculated on the trip, which has cost their drunkenness, and that it can happen that they only read the whole holiday on to work for the money for a single such Fete deserve," Dr Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies are not taking effect after Regressverfahren, which costs necessary to cure the intoxicated children demand from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
There are two easy fighter aircraft L-159 from a total of five, the Czech Defense Ministry has exchanged against the Casa aircraft carrier C-295M on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sets.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only for exercises or air shows to see.
It is the airline capable two-seats version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three planes are einsitzige L-159.
These are still einkonserviert in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - they last week accepted.
When they expediert the aircraft physical Vodochody, Jan Pejek, according to the spokesman of the Defense Department is still not known.
The einsitzigen fighter plane L-159, in turn, have been singled out for long-term stored aircraft, and that without further deposits and investments on the part of the department of the ministry.
"The double seats L-159T1 were exchanged in the current situation and appearance," said Pejek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army will not have to live without zweisitzige fighter aircraft as the Defense Department in May 2009, with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 on two-seats version signed.
A new aircraft, the army took over in July, the second if it wants to play until the end of this year.
According to Pejek EADS has committed warplanes in the equipment of the NATO countries to impose.
"The treaty is clearly pointed out that the company EADS aircraft L-159 customers and that those on the training of pilots of the NATO countries are supposed to serve.
"It is therefore up to the buyer, in what way he realised the matter," Pejek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 against a Casa aircraft carrier and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was in the past year by the government of Mirek Topolánek has been approved.
The Defense Ministry had tendered for purchase any bidding process, but spoke EADS directly.
The former Defence Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, which they used only 24, they wanted to sell the rest.
The acquisition of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial sting.
The European Commission sued the Czech Defense Ministry: at the European Court of Justice. The reason? it would have been the aircraft on the basis of a European call for tenders to choose and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already adopted three planes, the final is within 14 days at the Airport Kbely land.
A long finger as a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose finger long than the ring finger is obviously a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising result of a study on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer, was published.
This is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone are linked.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers as a simple test can be used for the risk of prostate cancer and this roll-call in men by 60," said the coauthor of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University in Warwick.
The finger may help to determine what men absolutely must undergo a prostatakrebs test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors are in place, such as family health burden, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period between 1994 and 2009, they sat with their counterparts in Britain, more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3 000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than the ring finger.
For these men was seen the same probability of prostate cancer, such as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and finger were the same for a long time.
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger, but this risk was reduced by 33 percent in men by 60 even at 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingers, which are already forming in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of Geschlechtshormonen, whom the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Vaclav Paes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, TK said, he was this study fugitive known, yet he consider the relationship between the length and the cancer has not so far been "completely proven."
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 blocked
Just as the main part of Europe is also the Czech Republic on Thursday morning under a snow cover.
On the roads and Gehwegen is mostly frozen snow, were Winterdienstler in many places the whole night on axis.
The motorway D5 between miles 89 and 90 in Rozvadov direction is some accidents about trucks and cars blocked and also the D1 Brno towards Prague "is."
It said the Novinky.CZ Dispatcher of the central Auto-Moto-Klubs (ÚAMK).
At mile 91 from a truck at kilometre 93 came two lorries together, there are those who were injured in the accident.
Even a few cars are on the road in jeopardy.
Problems also exist in kilometres of 185 of the highway toward Prague D1.
Also here are two lorries collision.
The driver should equal behind Brno kilometers 190 or drive about Brno and kilometres 182 learnt at the Kývalka site.
It is there that is forming interminable traffic jams.
Another accident happened on the D11 and the same arrived after Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolonnen, for example, in Stadteil Prosek, also trboholská the road is totally blocked.
There is the safest form of transport in any case, the Metro.
The tramways travel delays, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
In order to eight o'clock in the morning meets the Prague crisis unit.
Even with the railways and the airport there are problems.
The Czech government had to because Schneeverwehungs seven schnellzug compounds.
Problems arise, for example, on the line Prague - Kralupy or even Prague - Beroun.
It is urgent that the travellers should be informed about the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyn since Wednesday 11 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning closed.
Most roads in southern mähres are navigable only with increased caution.
In order to Vykov three secondary roads completely unbefahrbar in the vicinity of Brno, sometimes Schneeverwehungen and in the vicinity of Blansko it is forced on some higher location for Schneefräsen to use roads.
One of the hardest-hit areas is Výkov.
That is where three roads still closed off completely: Rousínov - Slavkov Bohdalice - Kuerov and also aratice - Mileovice.
Here too there will Schneefräsen for snow clearance must use.
When they will again be navigable, is yet to estimate.
In the Hodonín region is in the field of White karpaten caution.
On the streets of conservation reasons only with inerten cluster products must be distributed is an up to five centimetres thick snow cover, TK.
In the Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimeters Neuschnee, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes by 18 centimetres.
In the mährisch Silesian region fell up to 15 centimeters Neuschnee.
In the Czech Republic but it listens to slow to schneien.
American soldiers have a new "smart gun."
The American troops in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, which has not been known under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that these new automatic weapon influenced the local conflict with the Taliban and the balance of power shifts to their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super identify gun.
Your Projektils will indeed by lasers with a soundness of just a few meters guided into the goal.
The particular shells of calibre 25 mm, which have been developed for the rifle and hochexplosiven explosives contained, practical work, such as small shells.
The shells can be programmed so that it is not just at the moment of impact on the goal, but at any point of their ballistic trajectories can explode.
In other words, you can use them against an enemy, behind an obstacle - a wall or hidden in the front.
From above, it is usually not protected, the murderous steel cluster rains from the top so it can easily set apart from battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle the first infantry weapon, the "smart" technologies to harness.
"The soldier is basically so: he seeking the goal and sends a laser beam from a certain distance, so he wins a precise visier point, after which he corrected; corner, then he needs only abzudrücken.
"Let us say, it has measured 543 metres."
"If you abdrückt the weapon and know the distance 543 meters, plus or minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be relocated
The company Fujitsu relocated its branch in Bad Homburg after Frankfurt.
In July of next year will be 400 employees their jobs from the existing office buildings at the Marie bader place in Bad Homburg move in the Astro park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its branch in Bad Homburg after Frankfurt.
As the computer and its maintenance specialist in the industry giant announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men their jobs of the existing office buildings at the Marie bader place in Bad Homburg move in the Astro park, which is a large office complex at the Lyons street in Frankfurt Borough of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu said, in the medium term there should further 100 jobs will be housed in the company, which previously were distributed in the region.
This rental offer was very attractive, also could include the open-plan offices in the Astro Park operation is better, in violation of the staff.
Even in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only tenants.
The competent director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent links with the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu of great importance.
The latest move by a major company within the region yesterday called the joy at the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Funk (CDU) said, so that a "global player" was again won.
It was a "fantastic location creed."
Fujitsu bring to the city, the location was an important boost for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city was soon informed about the intention of the management.
"We have offered our help, of course, the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts had nothing to do with the difficulty of the computer manufacturers with the landlord of the property at the Marie bader place can change.
In the end, economics would have made the difference.
The challenge now is to prevent a long short subject in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building cooperative."
The Fujitsu has so far used house in the centre and the nearby "small vertical" were with the other buildings at the Marie bader place ten years ago on the controversial construction of the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project entwicklers has created a new urban entree between station and the town, both because of the massive development of previously largely land used as a parking lot, as well as for criticism was the size of the building.
In 2001, trade-related investment consultancy and credit rating company Feri, the software makers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and then computer manufacturers still associated with Siemens, Fujitsu houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu was in 2006 by the German Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish of Falcon Real Estate Investments SA sold in Madrid.
The Fujitsu-Konuzern agency in Tokyo described themselves as the third largest IT-Provider in the world.
It represents companies, for example, computers and servers willing and is also making the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine Main region is one of the largest in Germany, much more, however, Fujitsu is one of the staff in Munich.
From Bad Homburg prefers the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad a further subsidiaries at this site is intended to Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
To this end were in the Astro Park office buildings rented 7 000 square metres.
In the 20 years old set - the name plays on his sternförmig basic plan - including the Central Association electrical engineering and electronics industry for his seat.
Amazon servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks gear increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service providers has banished the investigative platform from its servers.
Perhaps that is behind this political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret Diplomaten-Depeschen.
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange is supposedly in England.
The investigative platform Wikileaks machine in the United States is increasingly under fire.
The track down lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet heimat in Europe.
The senior US Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange, who is on the wanted list of Interpol, will stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks supplanted by amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," told the Enthüllungs-Aktivisten via short messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
In short, the Internet companies had previously banned the Wikileaks-Dokumente from its servers.
Had the track down to the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) returned to the high level of access to pay to be able to cope with the documents.
Wikileaks said by Twitter to step further: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon have such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books."
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by WikiLeaks, after staff members of Senator Joe Lieberman any investigation would have told the television station CNN, citing the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened with a boycott, told the British Guardian.
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure previously classified information by WikiLeaks in the face of previous publications," said the senator.
Avigdor Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform also to deny the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks ' illegal, outrageous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangered around the globe lives," was in a communication from the parteilos senator.
"No responsible businesses - whether American or foreign - WikiLeaks should help in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange, because rape suspects sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent " follows the 39 year-old Australians in Britain at the exact place Scotland Yard is known.
The Internet activist investigations in Sweden has always been described as the set-up of his opponents.
Kristinn Wikileaks-Sprecher Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why I fear Assange labeled for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks-Gründer will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, was the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks-Enthüllungen should be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, said an aide of leader Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
And Assange arose between the White House to start a tennis match.
The spokesman of the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked if they recently leaked Spionage-Aufforderungen is responsible for diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we look at the opinion of a types with a website" as Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its a website."
The US government is now fully the protection of their databases to the test.
As a special envoy is the deputy director of the Centre for antiterrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House.
Travers is responsible for "the necessary structural reforms" to develop after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks have become necessary.
The White House also wants to examine the ways, as the entire government information and protects.
The US government also announced, to ensure the safety of dissidents and most active in trying to let them through the Wikileaks-Veröffentlichung in jeopardy.
"We have done everything we can to come into contact with them," said außenamt spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it becomes necessary."
The Eis-Universität
At the 'Gelato University' in Bologna Eiskonditoren be prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world.
What is really the whole ice?
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere German somewhat archaic Eiskonditor after all the rules, is the cream of the Italian Eisma royal art ago.
The Gelataio old with a Spachtel ice cream from the freezer counter that it is cutting into the Waffel and then sold them.
In order to know that we must not after Anzola dell'Emilia drive in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the "gelato university" by the Italian firm Carpigiani over.
The Eis-Universität manufacturer of Eismaschines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines in every corner of the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also started Spezialkurss around lost Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele.
Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, other cars simply backing the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the food movement and wants to be in the country of industrial Ice-Cream a European quality product to offer in the future.
Anke from Berlin, business adviser and wants after years in a nerve-racking job a bit eintüten.
Two young Egyptians dream to open an Eisdiele in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Yulia comes as Italian ice cream to love their children.
Luciano Maestro-Gelatiere Ferrari, the participants initially said the ideal characteristics for the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also the seidig fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen superstructure: ' By Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step towards the manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cooler.
Then he turns on the machine turning off a tap in and out of this mess is a white base cream, foundation for all the milk eiss.
As the teacher bestürmt with questions: can you ice cream only produce with natural substances without agent?
How can you own experimental free course?
Luciano warns the Zeitgeist mislead.
Who of ice cream "only" speech from natural ingredients, has possibly yet stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from Guarbohne.
Of course you can ice also produce without agent, it should only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt together, and the client bites in loud Eiskörnchen.
Some variations on the basic chips are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit department or to buy the sweets from the supermarket.
In addition there are bullets and Pasten.
"The suppliers are all trying to get dozens of aromatic ingredients you try to foist on."
"But you should simply experimenting."
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just on the ice cream from the white primary chips with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis of all possible Schokoladen-Verführungen.
Now we can change players in the Eismaschines.
Luciano leaves them each four different types of vanille, chocolate, produce Mokka and Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less whatsoever aroma or other natural additives.
According to the same experiment will be subjected to the eiss assembly.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-Eis is not necessarily palatable nut palm, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group, and used more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a Gelato correctly points out Luciano says.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: if used peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For Zitroneneis, an extra oats sugar is needed.
Luciano prefers a device is to be resolved, with which he the sugar content of fruit varieties certain (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately facilitate calculation tables.
Ice to make no longer requires as much physical use as in the past.
It is not just the device for the automatic production of basic material helps.
There is also a device in which the finished Eis-Mischung at the same time cremig beaten and chilled to freezing temperatures.
All automation in defiance not remain small mishaps.
The Brazilians Gustavo late and its stock price colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree than him outsized hand blenders control.
"In every course," says Luciano Maestro, "it is only a matter of time before something happens."
Controllers in the Zwielicht
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa is from the experimental industry infiltrated with Genpflanzen.
Thus, this accusation has now formulated the test biotech expert group, which turned out to be an independent institute to understand the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said Christoph Testbiotech-Chef Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expertengruppe for genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and for years a further EFSA expert are also in the Ilsi lobby organization under contract.
The corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper was involved in a major way to the Efsa-Prüfvorschriften for Genpflanzen and am so that in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticized.
The EFSA rules are marketing methods of viewing the same with the Ilsi position papers and make a contribution so that the imprint of the industry, the real authority in the Italian Parma should be controlled.
It is already the second time that a representative of the test biotech bemängle.
This is a senior EFSA managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and thus have switched sides.
Even the Central German radio (MDR) had recently unveiled personnel links between EU authority and industrial lobby, which the Environmental Office, as well as EU policymakers made sympathetic.
However, the Efsa can see no conflict of interest.
We refer you back to all the serious data, even in this industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement.
From the experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
You would have to disclose but this.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States a.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - partly on the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying mission.
In the matter have criticised independent experts such as Then that genetically modified crops currently without any feeding experiments on animals are allowed, and the reaction of Genpflanzen will not be tested on environmental influences.
"We want to know, for example, genetically modified corn makes on the field," says Then.
Derzeitige practice is merely isolated proteins, but not to test the whole Genpflanze, what am no reliable results.
"If the risks are not looking, how is it possible to find them?" asks Then accusatory.
It also provides Angelika Hilbeck so.
The scientist in the engineering since 1994 and is currently at the technical university of Zurich are active.
The industry experiments in this area as in the United States is now also in Europe are increasingly critical scientists to influence or to discredit.
There were so few researchers who were not intertwined with corporations.
For business critical studies were not published in the rule.
"The industry controls the security research," Hilbeck claimed.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell which has also become concerned, a total of approximately 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening from Stuttgart station he stood Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It snowed heavily.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators were angerückt and had started to cut a big slice of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: hundreds of thousands marched against S21, the station's multi-billion low erlegung.
When it came to a settlement freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins.
Zerbrochen 6 000, 7 000 pieces.
Crailsheimer mussel shell, a soft rough stone between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has a couple of scraps guaranteed.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"You should not go away."
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor ball, simple and detention."
When he is a aufsägte, was the rat for cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the headache, they still do not know.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen in a former munitions deposits of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire.
The 44 year-old person with old stones.
He has bought all fell in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would Schotter or disappear in the hole," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a young häuschen.
Beschimpft and they have threatened him, he told me, as in September in the newspapers that it bought the remnants of the northern wing of the demolition contractors have.
But he talked with the S-21-Gegnern for days.
And he told them that he can seize anything for the demolition).
And if it is now, then it is surely the right thing when the stones were reused.
About 200 S-21-Gegner then took an average of 80 kilos of heavy Quader with unit prices 6,50 up to 14 million.
As the memory, some but also in the hope that it will be able to return to a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had purchased Rongen 25 major Lkw-Ladungs.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
They come from wherever they are and have been weggeschleppt, which could bear boot space and supporters.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If no political component."
He is rising in his SUV makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura, he has studied and discontinued later biology, then he is interested in computers and, finally, dealers have become.
And Stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones he eclipses.
For Germany, completely karrt his treasures together.
He says he is the biggest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He slows down.
In the snow are skillful fitting sand stones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marie Bridge," he told me.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he schwärmt.
"My favorite stone."
It is the way high through the forest.
It shows a bunch: red sand stone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station.
She then.
"Schöner Travertin."
The Quader once belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadien.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin of the Stuttgart police headquarters, rötlich stone is complemented with from the cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what efforts which sweat.
If Rongen remembers how the stones in the past by hand and with a simple Flaschenzugs and karren were moved, it will be very reverential.
"It would be a scandal if we were a bit schreddern."
Reich is he not become immensely rich even less.
But 14 people discussing the stone dealers also have the top in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and a horticulturalists settled.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the residual those who exploit.
He must shortly after Cologne.
Similarly, there are obstacles to save.
Have cleverly campaign at High-Potentials
There is a brisk run at the buffet.
Sixteen students push for salmon something, tomato soup and trick.
The Technical University brown schweig and the car manufacturers Volkswagen have the engineering and Designstudenten invited to a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they should together with VW-Entwicklern fachsimpeln on the car of the future - and incidentally Volkswagen acquaintance.
In the scramble for the brightest minds go now many companies in the Nahkampf and, as VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: the smartest graduates to recruit as early as possible in the hearing rooms, before they come on the labour market and are being courted by others.
And because the university does not publish data on the performance of their students, an attempt is being made to the Ausnahmetalente in practical projects and to tie.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU brown schweig car company with the talent.
A young woman from the personnel department distributed ballpoint pen, rubber gum and Mappen with VW-Logo.
She told the hopeful Jungtalenten of training programmes and student jobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico Selle of the TU brown schweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW cannot at the same time, students learn interesting candidates more closely and consider who would come as a staff member in question."
Such cooperation, as Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that gebuhlt will be so offensive about the students.
"Otherwise, the emphasis was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, the companies can't their employees more to choose from a large flock of candidates.
But they need to advertise themselves and especially high skilled workforce balzen.
Above all graduates from the Ingenieurdisziplinen are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October about 40 000 engineering put vacant.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI-Prognosen.
For the accountancy field and consulting firm, and KPMG Dykta story have cleverly hunting.
It organized elaborate Recruiting-events such as the kpmg race, a kind of modern do with trails, in which the participants on the basis of GPS-Koordinaten must find their way.
Eight promising students, the company will next year send across the United States.
Incidentally, can look at the participants kpmg subsidiaries and to learn about the company.
Those of us who must decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flying into the United States.
At the cut and sting at the High Potentials of universities are growing every day, according to Dykta.
"We want to support us with the Race for the masses."
"It was only a simple Segeltörn us with little."
For have cleverly Dykta the bill seems to be working.
"We have to date with all the participants of a similar action last year contact."
"Some are nearing completion and will soon want to compete with us," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhle to go on campus, especially small and medium-sized businesses are also quite classic in professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We are trying to be graduates on specialist messes to achieve."
"Some of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary solar," reported Sitha Stübe Staff head in solar technology manufacturer of solar world.
The company employs approximately 500 staff in Germany.
Stübe knows about the recruitment problems.
There are currently on the corporate website for 35 posts advertised.
"It is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the Uni-Professors.
Solar world is cooperating with various universities, such as the university in free mountain.
"The professors giving indications that it will make us work experience, or can write his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not needed in the solar specialists.
To this end, the company is attempting with other benefits to promote: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can often do not offer a big company," says Staff head Stübe.
Money plays in the longer the main role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solar world came in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of German employers.
They interviewed staff as satisfied with their work and their Jobumfeld they are and look at the conditions for the workers.
Personnel head Stübe expects the placement is also used in the Jobsuchendes.
"I think that candidates particularly look for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler branding of the German Employer Academy advises companies with a long-term strategy to build a good reputation as employers want.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer, on their own staff," he says.
In industry jargon is the internal Employer branding, so employers brand education within their own workforce.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you do good for his people, and they identify with the company, then they would quite alone with friends and acquaintances for their employers to advertise.
"This is like a game with band," says Kriegler.
Obama would stop new oil drilling
Before the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the next few years.
The government in Washington has enacted a ban - and thus their previous plans finally revoked.
There are also new drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for the time being.
This told Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the ban, at least for the next five years to apply is the explosion of the Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, the 11 workers dead and to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama was due to pressure from the opposition and the industry for his willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico should be permitted.
Advocates want to ensure that the US dependency on oil from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is still not finalised.
In the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions in claims.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its findings during the month of December.
In October, Ministry of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
In the end had various oil companies immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a fresh disaster.
At the moment the competent supervisory authority, which after numerous accusations of corruption have been brought into disrepute, fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced lucrative tax schlupflochs to close for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry now publicly warns that the output in the Gulf by a tighter regulation would be significantly lower than in the past.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle for the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm BDO - even before the Bohrverbot on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly is with the regulation will change."
Investment in new projects would until further notice postponed - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is destroyed by fire
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like the petrol station: billion litres of spillage of crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The people live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari, it feels good.
"Plagt not away" reassured the green activist journalists: "You are still enough oil slicks from the lens wars."
The 37-year-old Nigerians have followed the attempt, one by watenden boy on the chest in the water with him around Schlieres abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen water are being is sapping the scene almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude hanging below the surface, is not to be seen.
In the past, they have collected buckets and wise shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo-Jetty-Flusses.
In the meantime, it should be the lazy river waters completely dead.
Before five years ago from a geborsten pipeline is a ton of crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now pull together for six hours, in order to get into fish containing waters: the Ogoniland situated in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered to be one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the mangrove sumpfs criss-crossed by rivers is striking the extent of the devastation.
Instead of bright water brown unsavory brew was wühlt the engine boat, who appears in his hand into the water, prefers ölig finger out of this mess.
The roots of the mangrove bäumchen as black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sad isolated trees to hang their Wedel.
Vogelschwärme, as they are usually in wetlands, looking in vain: as soon as the external border is spreading in the silent as a petrol station fragrance end eerily calm from former paradise.
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war is appropriate.
The residential area of the Ogoni is a Europe for decades disputed battlefield: here, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe a here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first opposition here, the shell company has ceased its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for its Ölarbeiter.
Even today, the company denied the return to Ogoniland: while the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5 000 Bohrquellen and 7 000 miles donated more than two million daily barrels of black gold are pumped in Ogoniland, the oil fields, are lying idle at the corporation is unstable situation.
All the few hundred metres out steel Gestells as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christian bäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes sunk much cited lack.
They are up to 50 years old, most shook korrodiert.
It is always such a Bohrkopf apart, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres, according to expert estimate in 50 years were spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta: year on year, the amount of oil, as they are in the wreck of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea off Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the continuing Öko-GAU about the dispute.
While the shell group of sabotage and organized Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible, environmentalists see berstend Bohrkopfs and pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell attach in Nigeria much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US-Wissenschaftler Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: alone, the rate of defects in the pipelines was "is several times higher than elsewhere."
At one place from afar as an abandoned, ölverschmiert garage under open looks, they appear to be finalised from the Mangroves: you are naked and ölverschmiert up to the neck.
Under one of the many pits, partly associated with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site, a fire flackert: an illegal small refinery.
The barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours heated, said Michael, the head of the group.
First of all, gets petrol through the pipes in the detention facility, and later tröpfelt at the end of the leadership kerosene and finally diesel, it has emerged.
Thus produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis, up to four Fässer diesel à 300 litres of water: "This brings us 34 000 Naira a ' - around 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the Africa's largest oil state.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
According to the just under 40 euro cents per litre ridiculously low diesel prices can still offer the illegal Kocher: for their raw materials are getting it for free.
It comes from "Bunkerern," the pipeline network across the whole of Ogoniland on tap: in this way to go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta every day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material is illegal: according to the lion's share fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers should belong in tankers, and command him on the world market.
The debate, whether the disaster rather the activities of the population, or is due to the lax practices, the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"If the oil companies are not perceived as invaders and they should have been the livelihood of the fishermen are not as thoroughly destroyed, there was neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, it is the relationship between the Ogoni people, especially on Shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the company in question would be: "Maybe there are other nationalities, such as the Chinese as a better out of this mess."
Michael will be as nervous.
"It is high time that it disappears," says muskulös Ölmann.
"Every minute, the soldiers can come."
If caught, the illegal Ölveredler of the special unit of the armed forces face no arrest, but a painful bribes.
Similarly, mainly from the rural, young soldiers want - like all Nigerians - will benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in A380 Triebwerken
The A380 seems to be a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defects in the investigation of a notgelandeten machine to a "catastrophic train case" could result.
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the notgelandeten Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more luck than familiar: the Australian air safety authority in their investigation a major security problem in the engines of some A380 machines detected - and now warns of a possible construction defects.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: it could Ermüdungsrisse with a Ölschlauchverbindung and leakages produce," they said in a statement published on this Thursday the authority ATSB.
This would have "a catastrophic train incident" can lead.
They are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce whose 20 aircraft, the A380 series.
This is the Qantas-Airbus, who had to notlanden in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
They submitted a claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney a allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said his airline will receive compensation for the incident to demand at the beginning of November.
The fire in the engine parts had abated and the Tragfläches damaged.
Rolls-Royce whose made a Ölbrand as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now worldwide to 40 design engines to be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced to conduct additional safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce whose said ATSB-Sprecher Martin Dolan.
The security problem is deemed sufficiently important to inform all interested parties.
After the Qantas-Maschine of an emergency evacuation, the airline had its A380 fleet kept for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven year temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa changed in a year as a precaution, the train station.
The doppelstöckige line is the biggest passenger airliner in the world.
Land further snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany entirely in white: overnight almost fallen snow throughout the country.
Chaos on many roads, trains and flights.
In car accidents, at least three people died.
The winter frostet Germany: in icy temperatures is almost the entire republic in the night zugeschneit on the Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east are partially 15 centimetre thick snow deckes.
On several motorways and many roads are severely restricted the movement.
On the A7 at Flensburg was the winter service in the permanent deployment, with the constant aufwehenden of snow but not finished.
In addition fegten fierce Bös on the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrographie (BSH) expected on the Baltic coast Schleswig-Holsteins from morning to storm flood with water levels by 1.2 meters on the normal course of play.
In Saxony, the Schneeverwehungs led to significant problems on the motorways and federal roads.
According to the meteorological centre Meteomedia was affecting Switzerland so alert trendy purple - the highest stage in the first place.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters Neuschnee, fresh and strong winds were responsible for Verwehungs.
That is where they remained in the night stuck several trucks and cars.
In Saxony-Anhalt also notified the police major disruption on the roads.
On the A2 led snow and wind at stalled traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia were affected by the snow, the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn is in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and significant disruptions in the north in Bavaria.
Snow on the rails, fallen trees on the track or destroyed upper lines and guidelines are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance transport from Leipzig had to be stopped after Nuremberg.
The thüringisch is a us volume of activity had to stop his trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were firemen and Rettungshelfern with Wolldeckes food and drink during the course of care.
Schneewinde fegten on the streets.
At major German airports, the Schneewinde lead to numerous flight cuts.
In Munich, according to a spokesman for the Flugauskunft-Zentrale have already reported some cancellations.
In Frankfurt am Main were already 40 flights have been cancelled, according to a Fraport-Sprecherin.
The winter service is in the permanent deployment.
Yes, there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, they are still less than 400 beds ready.
On many streets, it was already on Wednesday evening to accidents.
The night was a lorry driver in the crash with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein lost their lives.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg happened because snow covered roads to a similar accident: here, too, there was a lorry at a railway crossing covered, because the car remained.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers injured in the train - the line of Bayreuth after Nuremberg was therefore up closed in the early hours.
In addition, a 30 year-old woman died after she with her car in construction, had to beat on slippery roads.
One piece of good news meteorologists, however: it is true that the snow will still be loose and pulverig and therefore already with an easy Bös.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and stürmend winds.
However, it remains very cold - local methods to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
The German bank wants to separate itself from its emblem: according to a newspaper report seeks monetary house buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euro could bring the property.
The German bank has just made wonderful their corporate headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt banking quarters have been modernized; now the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
But the costs of the financial group now wants to get the renovation apparently - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, such as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, citing a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale, called the speaker does not.
"We always consider whether it makes more sense to even possess or sell real estate, and then zurückzumieten," he said.
This is Germany's biggest credit institute his headquarters once again after a short period of time.
The bank had the twin tower until the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros taken up by investors of a domestic fund and then repaired.
The energy conversion devoured the information after around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money in the bank.
Industry experts are value now in " green towers ' renamed towers, according to the newspaper at around 500 million euros.
Whether the building again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands mourn dead buddy
More than 10 000 people are thought buried miners in New Zealand after several explosions in a mine were declared dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation is precarious in the continuing wretched schacht.
Barely two weeks ago, it was in the Pike River mine near the town of grey to come up with a fierce explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years ago were buried under several days.
A probe has been left in the schacht, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions could not rescue forces for security reasons is set to increase.
After the second fierce blasts were the authorities and experts assumed that there is no survival diminished for mates.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now flash relatives and friends with a memorial ceremony for the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in bright sunshine in grey gathered at the New Zealand southern island.
They were silent for two minutes.
A Tribute to the buried miners were 29 tables set up on their helmets, lamps and were able to see the names of the sidekick.
There are also pictures and personal belongings, including clothes and Surfbretter found a niche here.
Before the government buildings in the country, the flags flying at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the ceremony.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son, as long as he does not whose corpse was seen, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister, the victims' relatives and measures several foreign diplomats at the ceremony part.
In the first explosion on 19 November were also miners had been buried in British and South African origin.
Rescue workers started a fire in the interior of a coal mine in the southern island of New Zealand to erase.
As soon as the explosive gases are ousted, will be started, the herunterzukühlen hot temperatures inside the mine, said Police Minister Gary Knowles to journalists.
With regard to the hell!
Assimilate Splatter for art cinemas?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his combatant saga "Walhalla Rising," new from old the genetic boundaries.
The Danish director at which audience may Nicolas Winding Refn thought when he "Walhalla Rising," revolved around?
A captured wikinger warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberated from his Peinigers and sets with almost superhuman forces order as his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods used and its enemies before the Gedärms alive, if he bad mood.
On the other hand says Einauge as he is called, in fact, the whole movie about nothing, and also the other characters are at most times on one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschreis.
Otherwise, silence and gruselig beautiful hill scenery in Scotland have feasted upon the wikinger world of about a thousand years provides the backdrop.
More ideal for adult Cineasten with interest of Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys.
Fine, if a film has several target groups, only a pity if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been in force for his wild and gestylt drogendealer trilogie 'Pusher' as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to have stoically, his works with a little more humour to the mainstream, or a little less brutality to make the Arthouse available.
Most Kunstkino-Freunde are likely from around spritzend brain mass and the Gedärms be deterred.
The Action-Fans will then be able to die from boredom, if Einauge free interpretierbaren grounds with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity for a fixed mired in depression and fog before the team arrives in America seems to be and remain silent.
It is no wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising," has found no movie in cinemas in Germany and is now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly due to the magnificent images of a shame, but also because behind the grandiose until blood triefend facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema deserves attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a coherent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film had fever dream.
And for which there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn he might barely a moment of relaxation, and he undertakes with his icy images and the sinister Trance-artigen sound track very slowly, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the hearts of the characters has anti-American.
Only a small blond boy, the Einauge faithful to the side, retains something like innocence, everyone else will be driven by anger.
Most of the blind hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies sometime on the warrior from hell, possibly with the ambassadors of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps even for the already Verdorbenen.
"Walhalla Rising," is a mysterious film you can hate and admire the Ärgers, Aufregen and next.
It is a thrill.
Puzzle Erdarbeiten
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country does, however, to comment - still leaves it controls.
Mr. President, around midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 will jump at least four Israeli F-15 i warplanes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Tigris; the next major town, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor to Syria, allegedly with help from North Korea has built in the Quader, hidden in a valley of the stream.
According to a briefing from the CIA, US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes by the end of April 2008 would be well under the name of the near village el-Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - which could be employed to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes hardly worth the technology from the fifties.
The CIA has led a video presentation with vague satellite imagery.
Per computer they ignored a animation which components of the reactor should be have been before the destruction of a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center is.
They also presented photographs showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior compartment.
The reactor was briefly stood before the beginning of the operation, it was said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was then, of course, the mystery has been even wider with the passage of time.
Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoir that the CIA was fairly safe before the attack that Syria has built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly evidence saw that in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program existed."
Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are more cautious prefer to see and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they CIA-Präsentation to keep "plausible."
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
What we need, as I am sure he was a nuclear reactor, a high UN-Diplomat replied only flat over the summer, the IAEA was "enough material to ask questions."
According to the rubble of the alleged "ungenutzten Militärgebäudes" the Syrian authorities rushed to one side and thoroughly planierten the terrain.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by the former chief inspector Olli hein in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received commercial providers of a Member State satellite images directly from the time after the attack, which should be more powerful than the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to get on the market, because the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought the exclusive.
Therefore, the IAEA could not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always declared, never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor built.
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA indicated that, according to analysis of particles as unlikely back.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - just as it did about the satellite imagery.
In addition, it denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of bombed-out buildings.
But Israel also says the iron.
"We never comment on ', recently reiterated at the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position.
So the investigation of the case since June 2008 in vain, "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about which the IAEA monitoring.
As a key to progress in resolving the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, "functional contact" with the alleged reactor should - and unlike those still exist.
In doing so, the inspectors have neither disclosed which assets it is still what role they are or what they can appear to be suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be on the IAEA internal as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah called in turn derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and at satellite images tracked down a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely is one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - exactly with this justification, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be vorgeschickt by the United States, auszuspähen at military installations.
Because the Nukleardetektive were caused by a piece of the US intelligence agencies learned.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the Quader material on the Tigris, was transported.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities" so uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not enriched.
But where the uranium could have come from and where it has turned into at a later date should be separated plutonium for the bomb, these central issues if anything, there are plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could involve valuable clues in the three places were stored.
When would the hundreds Lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information on where the rubble has remained.
The only a few kilometres from el-Kibar located on the other side of the Tigris salt mine in al-Tibni, Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a storehouse for radioactive waste has been analysed, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley she was recently in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in mid-afternoon.
Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria in three suspicious places Erdarbeiten and large containers, after the IAEA access had requested.
This cannot be coincidence, but has contributed little to dispel the suspicion.
It is also in diplomatic circles, the IAEA had spent a number of months to develop a plan for inspections there, Syria should allow to maintain any military secrets - only the tape shows how great the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also bügelte this proposal.
Although Western diplomats in Vienna before a year to appease the reactor was destroyed, the matter was therefore no urgency, brings about US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months the so-called special inspection into the game, one of the strongest funds that has the Vienna nuclear agency to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, which should propose these inspections, has been " an option for which I am open in the future ', even though he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: first, it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in a time of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of their still nameless debüt has begun, there is anger.
She has even written the script, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man.
Rather, we do not know about it - but it is sufficient for unrest.
There is the rumor, the woman, a Muslim woman, verliebe during the Yugoslav war in her Serb rapist.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some Drehtags planned in Sarajevo have been transferred in the short term after Hungary.
In the meantime, the film marginalised in Hungary and in the postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote on the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR, Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - even the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk Goodwill Ambassador Jolie.
It is not Diplomatisch - it was the women from several weeks before a meeting in Hungary offered what but refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten, it was not given in Vergewaltigungscamps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script.
Your organization has recommended, according to the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk to dismiss as a Goodwill Ambassador Jolie, the Guardian reported.
But what exactly Jolie wrote for scenes?
The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing issued a permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then nothing came.
The young author even claimed to have no political intentions with her film was incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict with a lot of effort, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties.
Content, however, it remains vague.
Thus, even a second Synopsis for the film in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew it before war broke out and meet again, a Bosnian Muslim woman when she is kidnapped in a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape verknallt torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, as Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation."
She can now probably just give the hackers of Hollywood peace: in dismissing the script, like so many before, illegally on the Internet.
There is nothing like away here
This night is finally back right around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
To this end, the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans johlen pleasure in pushing loud music, it with the feet.
The Bailey-Pub bebt in the southern Irish Cork, because the players Tischtennisbälle on a three metre ' throw in beer pot - and meetings.
"Beer pong" refers to the bizarre spectacle of winning there are 500 million premium, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong-Weltmeisterschaften in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the low-key computer, which is not really fits together.
Yet tried the 26 year-old person to deflect the nagging question of what the future will bring.
In his plan is not playing card in Las Vegas, in January, he will Bewerbungsgespräche lead in New Zealand.
"I an uneasy," he says.
"It is so far away from home and I still have no work."
After all: his girlfriend in Auckland have been waiting for him - "they had zuck their Wunschjob as event managerin, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of poor prospects at home have already been two of Tanners three Geschwistern sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social arbeiterin in Sydney, his brother, Colin, now has a point as IT-Berater in London.
The boys go: as with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the next period of time, say experts of the Economic and Sozialforschungsinstituts ESRI in Dublin ahead.
Until 2015, they count even with 200 000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants have a fierce loss.
Bewahrheiten forecasts, it comes at a high level of emigration wave similar to that in which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery for the Irish has brought great prosperity, is now once again wide.
The economic crisis will be shaken, especially the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it was previously only uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed money there was in abundance.
In the meantime, however, there are three of 10 women and men under 30 without a job.
In the Irish Times, there is no shortage of Leserbriefe young expatriates who complain: "Everything is crashed in Ireland."
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can, are away and so that our country is losing a whole generation."
"The last thing we do ask the light."
Studentin Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish student union, bringing a grim future, because the government only window dressing and the young people no longer provides a future prospects.
"You reduce wages, but they have no strategy as new jobs are to be created," says 20 people.
They watched as their colleagues from an unpaid internship to another.
Your main concern, she says, it was four years ago to emigrate himself to have.
"This is an idea that is sad and depressing."
In doing so try men such as Stephen McLarnon positive to occupy the subject.
McLarnon organized the "working abroad exhibition," a fair, an all-round service on work abroad offers.
"For entrants is the work abroad but a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website shows photos server in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a Galeerendienst, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it is, that's something to build elsewhere, white Seán O'Donovan for half a year.
Because of the 29 year-old engineer in Ireland had nothing more to be done, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Genselkirchen withdrawing just a fashion house high.
In January, it continues to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home O'Donovan sees now only rarely, because it makes Extraschichten the credit for being able to abbezahlen his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, as he for a long time for the first time is stepping over the threshold of his home.
"I deserve the money in Germany for a home in Ireland, where I almost never am."
He laughs a little embarrassed and through ausgekühlt areas.
The small house is in a nice neighborhood with leafy front gardens to park in the Einfahrts big, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O'Donovan house was bought for 380 000 euros for four years - 100 per cent of credit financed.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions," he says.
Did he fear that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thought for a while, hot tea after and says: "I have no children, I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start new."
The civil engineers may not, which he currently often hears.
"No one should go hungry, but our situation is nowhere near as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"A long time working abroad, which is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps as a result, we are only as Irish people."
Then he laughs and tells of his father in the last major economic crisis has gone to England.
"After seven years, he was back and that life was in Ireland to continue, very simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
The future open and just look how it runs with the life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has also been behind and why it should not run well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
There is one thing but still it felt worried these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a lebewohl birthday party.
"The not too many emotions," he says, and drink a big Schluck of his beer.
"Goodbye, sounds scary."
"We prefer to call it a Weggehparty, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine
The pro-democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States.
These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage, which carried out in 18 countries and exclusive, was published in The Economist.
Since 1995, this survey will be carried out on a regular basis and shows so the freedom of change in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries the democratic movement in the South American Pacific Coast has increased sharply (Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 is growing by approximately 6% per year, has increased the number of democracy activists by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy since the sharp downturn in the past year recovered, is to see such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (graph 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practices of their country. That as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are equivalent to those of last year, but to show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
Before a decade undermined Latin American economic crises efforts for more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis is probably due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession, and speedy recovery.
In addition, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year).
Yet from country to country there are strong Stimmungsunterschiede (graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking reflect that.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
It was only the second time since polling began to see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (graph 5).
Approximately 31% say that either themselves or a family member in the past year, victims of a crime, but however compared to 38% in the last year have sunk the values and thus achieve the lowest since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private sector and the market economy is mirroring: approximately 71% of respondents to a regional that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (graph 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), even though her leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has loudly 19% of the respondents (18% last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see the most influential country in the US, although this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
An election weak
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts exceeded the fears of polling officials who rushed to help the troubled country, far from it.
Overcrowding Wahlurnen multiple votes, election notes in Rinnstein destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Wahllokale opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom became homeless by the January earthquake were built against mountain slopes in search of a choice.
Finally, some gave the whole.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leader, demanded on the basis of an alleged fraud, the lifting of the election results.
In the whole country was partly violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet called the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as good in many issues."
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community "to make these irregularities so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful."
In other words, the show goes on.
The Electoral Commission, which alleged the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Célestin Jew, obligated, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap-Musiker Michel mart elly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial ungültigkeit claim.
If Célestin Jewish voters little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the runoff, it could lead to problems.
As a result of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million for the earthquake victims are still living in tents, feared a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians have been hindered by a lack of organisation of the vote.
Shortly before polling began were approximately 250 000 identity cards, which are needed for the election has not yet been distributed.
There is much at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
Whether it resulted in a re-election bid next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also directed the economic policy after the election of his wife, often budgets on tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation are not fully covered.
This enabled the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit.
In the paper last year Mr. government lost the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further clashes.
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another hit in the face and others lying to the government of corruption), the Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss," as the President.
The budget for 2010 now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend as they see fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is for Z. at 11,1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - push the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was racked by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its key objectives, and not the inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector schikanierte and säuberte, the national institute for statistics and census INDEC, then schönte the official inflation statistics.
Fernandez can now take a path?
It was the private sector and the trade union leaders called to talks.
And, according to official statements are supposed to pay increases in the next year will be limited to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the spurt by a great devaluation in 2002.
May wish to Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial back to join the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the country's previous restructuring had rejected in 2001.
Fernandez now appears on an agreement with the lenders to push from the Paris Club, to whom it owes around 6,7 Dollar billion.
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, the usual always rejected.
But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" it looks as it would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernandez after their term even without the support from her husband will be politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
If the Argentines in March to return from its summer recess, will be the wave of Sympatie, it has been shown to be fizzled.
If they want to win another election, they must decide whether they have many political decisions to lift her husband's quietly.
Schwacher applause for China
Taiwan's voters are coming slowly to a closer connection to the mainland.
What is stopping Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits?
On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters in the five Stadtbezirken to elect mayors and councillors. This is as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou has been interpreted.
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma, even a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949, sustainable changes.
Ma took the test, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the director of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election that would have meant for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%.
For the first time the DPP even pulled together with the KMT in the local councilors a.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan, such as Lastwagenkonvois, Flaggen-schwenkende Massenumzüge and rarely are.
There was even the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT felt on the eve of the election with a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten
When he was a man shot in the face from the crowd. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehend spectator.
Rather, it is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and the DPP in a bad light brought what the KMT has brought more voices.
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationship was not addressed to the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and are opposed to China's military threat.
This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not like to see in the foreground.
But this time also avoided the DPP anti-Chinese sentiments to stir up too.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese people supported its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan attract with economic incentives in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei, for a summit to prepare investment security and medical cooperation.
It also wants a political integration. But first things first.
It is better to ensure that waiting until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented.
Before two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison.
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008 he vehemently for the absolute independence a.
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and young people.
Tsai was held as a presidential candidate of the DPP consent, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party will do everything in order to show that it is also capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a of think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This would require an unbiased discussions ahead.
Tsai said publicly that their party will offer a "credible alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence.
He urged the pragmatist Su even to forgo the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult to choose their potential candidate.
The KMT will undergo its own self-analysis must.
Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to conduct their campaigns without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seems unemployment and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor.
According to testimony, he will be a KMT-Sprechers cabinet and revamp the local facilities.
The strong emergence of DPP suggests that Taiwan supports only limited a rapprochement.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."

Trombone Shorty, a pirate in some favorite from New Orleans and more frequent guest in HBOs "Treme" was an excellent Zeitgenössischer to jazz in the category in which otherwise rather Alben by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk-Musikers Darcy James Argue got into the category of large group deserved attention. It upsetting against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his Chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life-Ablum "Merseyside pathways" a good example of a Bassist as a democratic gang leaders.

Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was held after a lengthy, often heated public hearing the unanimous commitment from the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project, both terrorism and traffic jams to promote.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center is in line with local rules and will be an aesthetic profile fishing.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"When Americans makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are very noisy."
"Wonderful people in this valley."

Arsen-resistente microbe could new life forms on Earth or elsewhere permit
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, including arsenic can live, opens up new opportunities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, their view, it is a sign that a life even without the previously deemed as essential elements is possible.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow, either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it quite special, even though it is almost a kind of 'fremde ' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday appears in the online edition of the journal Science.
Until now, there have been six main elements considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the researchers discovered that the bacterium grows in California's mono Lake even further if it has to be replaced by arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the report's Co-Autor Ariel D. of Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for outside life, as scientist lives and need to see its forms as of Anbar.
The study deals with microbes that have been found on the planet.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were disclosed about the discovery was cause for widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could act by the discovery of außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other Planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'Standardelemente ', which, in our view, are absolutely essential, are not necessarily fixed prescribed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in the United Kingdom from Milton Keynes.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a new thing, because it shows that in an element of fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," said Cockell will be added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiologischen Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake as a result of the high Arsengehalts.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemical equal, they thought that microbes, which are both suspended, possibly an element can be replaced by the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens above all is that it is chemically similar phosphorus."
"It is difficult, the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic if it works differently than phosphorus. It ends up in our biochemisches system, where it verschmiert at almost everything," said of Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It wanted and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but it can also survive in arsenic, shows that a life form can happen, of course, either on the Earth or another planet or moon, the arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, believe in microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new but so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic was more frequently in the early Erdjahren, she says, so the science is based on the assumption that early life forms have used it.
"The reason the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important," as Forster, which is not a member in Wolfe-Simons research team was.
The research were from NASA, the Energy Department and supported the national health authorities.
Matter of fact, stolen Ausstellungshunde found in Compton
The other two of the four Ausstellungshunde were stolen from a Bellflower-Motel, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs found on Thursday.

Peek and Rickard who live in Redding, found themselves in this weekend because of the AKC/ Eukanuba National champion in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, should the other dogs in the days before the AKC/ Eukanuba-Show participate in other competitions.
South kalifornien is a halt to the nearly month-long tour of the pair of dog show to dog show.

The lion brüllt again after court approval of the MGM-Umstrukturierung
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty MGM finally got the green light for a new beginning.
A bankruptcy judge began New-Yorker on Thursday offiziel the "prepare" Gläuberplan, in order to repay debts amounting to $5 billion and the 86 year-old entertainment companies to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
According to the statements on Thursday, the plan has met the requirements of the US-Konkursrecht, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are the slightly slimmed-down studio as CEO.
The staff numbers about 400 to approximately 320 reduced.
For MGM will enter Chapter 11 real first in force when JPMorgan Chase a planned loan of 500 Dollar million to finance the new MGM-Produktionen has been completed.
At the moment is leading a consortium of investment bank, even 75 Dollar million of revenue, the company. The funding will be until the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & CO, the company's board, with interest payments in the amount of output of 300 Dollar billion--an Mio/ year, struggled to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Harry Sloan, the chief executive has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was known.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper MGMs to resolve the financial concerns and the more than 140 Gläuber of Studio auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009, to offer to buy the company.
But the auction drew only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch, as the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and infighting at the end of October was finally signed by the creditors.
If MGM formally in the next few weeks, the bankruptcy has survived, preserved Moelis and Cooper for their work, a bonus amounting to several millions of dollars.
The proportion of Moelis and the rest, which is already 1,2 Dollar million received amounts to 9,5 Dollar million
Cooper, who are paid a monthly 375.000 Dollar for the leadership of the company has received a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, and this year brought only a movie, it turned out the studio and produced an annual plan with seven or eight movies, beginning in 2012, are to arrive in cinemas.
They also plan two films after " small Hobbit ' in Co-Produktion with Warner Bros.
The studio needed a separate bond between 265 Dollar million to 275 Dollar million for its financial share in these two films, under the aegis of Peter Jackson should arise.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of the MGM-Darlehens sought a merger with Lions Gate of the studio entertainment, whose largest shareholder is.
But the final negotiations between the two companies has led to no result.

Police action in China will be milder
As a training officer stepped on an urban place, Tang Shenbin reviewed his anxious subordinates and gave orders to military authority and subdued voice.

You should crude police a softer, feminine aspect give.
Unfortunately, it would also be able Scarlett Johansson hardly the bad image that the Chinese people from these urban squads to improve.
By law, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials, the municipal laws should only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, prügelten officials in Hubei Province, a bystander to death than those using his mobile phone and filmed as they defeated a strong protest against a dustbin.
Last year was a training manual for the Beijing officials that have been stolen and published on the Internet. This report described how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai Water Melo dealers after a show of gemenge with five agents from brain injuries.
A violence strotzend video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows officers trained in China in an assault on hawkers.
"Cheng guan of the government's fear," the national newspaper China Daily lamentierte in the last year, after more controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called a "real thorough cleansing."
Skeptics find the current approach clearly inadequate.
When the Distrik in October by the board searched eight female recruits, a Editorial in the Beijing Evening News the question whether the women real tasks had been or simply should serve as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to vacancy notice were women aged 18 to 22, with good figure and "harmonious" sought.
You should be abnormally large - about 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs.
The employment relationship ends with achievement of the 26 years of age.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 physically exhausting.
"The most important is its image" was a unbenannter district officer in the Rednet have been virtually ruling website..
"Whether the candidates to get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, Gesichtszüge, etc."
Then temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female cheng guan, as they are put," he said, and added, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the municipality of the district would not agree with this description,
But admitted that China's size limits in advertisements for both genders are not unusual.
The same applies to evenly.
Whether it is synonymous with good looks, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical need not apply.
"Here, unfortunately, we cannot use Lahmes or Buckligen," as Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, on the Baoguang-Platz near a monastery, patroliert 22, Apfelbäckchen and a well shaped mouth.
They empfindetes not as a sexist, that so great value is placed on their appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with wry look.
Your colleague with the Grübchen, the 21 year-old Xu Yang, commented, "we have the duty to represent the image of the city."
Your reckoning, they do not regret the short attitude, because they have more ambitious career plans had than simply traders, or people through the streets in order to prevent them in the business.
Every morning the Streife deals with around 12 hawkers who try to walk or bike as much as possible to sell rolls and Tofugerichte before they continue.
"Mr Wang, you disappear here, please."
"We have so often said to you that!" said Frl. Xu a trader who had fled on foot, and his nudel kitchen attached to a bicycle karre had temporarily abandoned.
According to the officials, the work is more monotonous than arduous.
"It is almost every day the same," said Huang Jing, 20, in the leisure, distribution system is being studied.
"Everything routine."
One reason is that the female servants of the goods of merchants not as their male colleagues should confiscate.
You criminals can only threaten them to notify their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public harassment that those officials in China are often exposed.
Hundreds of residents rioted outside in this year, Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour stock-market boom, Chengguan-Beamte had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-Beamte were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government cars have been undermined or burned.
Xindu of these Gewaltausschreitungen have so far been spared.
But do not exclude the possibility of civil unrest.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang-Platz, in which the female officials this morning, patroulierten gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, contrary to the rules on the pavement, rather than in a garage has been repaired.
The owners cried raised a hue and cry.
After 15 minütigem hesitation gave the officials with grim faces the way to their cars and drove with the bike and its owner continues.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, stayed back, and he turned around his name tag knows to remain anonymous.
As their female colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," said Mr. Li sober.
"Most of the time people start with the dispute."
Prosecutor will not denounce Senator Ensign
Prosecutors from the Justice Department have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges after his Affaire with a former election worker and his attempt to give their husbands a lobbying against him were collected, gave the lawyers familiar with the senator on Wednesday.
This decision will put an end to the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and dealt a setback of his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was on the ruling after the year-long investigation "delighted."
The ethics committee of the Senate could still impose an Disziplarstrafe.
According to a statement made by Ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice, that the investigations against Senator Ensign hired and that no further indictments are available in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The ruling was for many Ethik-Anwälte outside the Justice Department a surprise. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign the lobbying ban has been flouted.
Interviews, emails and other documents for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times revealed were prompted to suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents to lucrative contracts for his silence on a Affaire with Hamptons Cynthia wife to buy.
Cynthia Hampton was Ensigns during an election campaign working as a treasurer.
Ensign took part in contact with some political friends to Hampton work. According to the documents and Verhören he took for it to halt Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team was, it was he was allowed a year no lobbying for his former employer, or the entire Senate.
According to experts in the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton Affaire were chummy, against the so-called Drehtür-Lobbykratie ban.
According to the published evidence " is apparently a consultation and the violation of the Drehtür-Statuten ' so Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who are in the sights of the government.
While the Justice Ministry official refused, the reasons for the decision to announce in Ensign-Fall, said Mr. Brand and other Ethikanwälten notes, the ministry is very cautious in the Aufnehmen of political charges after a variety of setbacks have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year, the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the state prosecutor decided to drop.
Prosecutors "are clearly fearful confinement," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose objective is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign was brought before the courts.
"This basically means that high-level officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, on Monday, he received a telephone call from a prosecutor and another on the next day, in which he was told that no complaints against his client, the ministry will levy.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday again reiterated, "acted in accordance with the law" was.
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had raised in relation to the prosecutors to explain in more detail.
"I was not well in the negotiating details between me and the Justice Department to go with it, but so much is said:" we believe the right decision, " he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to stop to investigations because of a separate complaint with the ethics group, for which a payment of 96 000 Dollar by Mr. Ensigns parents in the Hamptons have violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it was not enough evidence existed that the money is anything but was a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit.
An Email in December 2008 proves that, after the company, "Mr Hampton has been promoted as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he announced that he was at the Interior Ministry for a cause" anklopfe ."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and a different customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, to agree to a meeting in the name of the airline, after this Mr. Hampton had been hired for the purpose of lobbying.
As the last year for the first time, information came to the public on this affair," Mr. Ensign apologize to his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the hierarchy of the Republican Party in fourth place.
Having no longer struck many months ago, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago of reporters that he would like to see a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of criminal investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator would like to hope that the Ethics Committee very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and closing its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada to continue," she said.
Cheshire on Twitter draws attention
A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
They verschickten in their reports on Twitter of gruesome testimony.
In the end, as the defense, there were more than 140 000 Twitter-Meldungen on trial for rape and gekettete children in beds in a house, the flare-up.
On Thursday the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end, when the judgment on the death sentence, which the jury pronounced falls.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests submitted in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years.
It is one of the most provozierend reasons that it through the intense coverage of the trial - even with the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - into a "circus atmosphere" and a more widespread immediately penetration aufrührerischer details came, so that the jury in an improper manner had been influenced by the public outrage.
This appeal could prompt the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies, new rules are needed in the courtroom.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is really a danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom, the right of each individual affected to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the Supreme Chamber of Appeal rejected the requests last week by ruling succinct back when he said that the New Media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades Gerichtseinsprüche have noted that the coverage of notorious cases of doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which is supposed to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because the new media with a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" would have been.
Some believes that the TV show and the movie "on the flight" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, Gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes conviction be seen half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard was unimaginable to regulate.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in trials, which will be followed by a broad public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, but his report also says that it will be imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte may be intrigued by the idea that the restriction of immediately communication from the courtroom, it turned out, could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many who set out by Mr. Hayes lawyers to discuss a number of years and thus delay a condemnation.
For example, the defense lawyers also claim that Mr. Hayes may already have been vorverurteilt as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Jurors, by giving them showed gruesome Tatortfotos during the juror selection.
Some have said the Jurors photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke petit 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust.
The protesters say they were also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges have mistakenly exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury free over the weekend.
The Jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting about the process prefers perhaps the greatest interest.
In a anfechtung, which have submitted them last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and has been discussed by the candidates for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media continuously had rekindled the flames of the emotions of the case.
"Such a daily crush of media piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "it has been previously in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide have yet to be seen."
Your emphasis on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
Some journalists have said in interviews that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but as reports, which will be reimbursed at a slower rate, is a technikfeindlicher glance, the verarme reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes, the Adaptation sidelined by the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers to strengthen this assertion.
In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr Sheppard was removed as a result of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media new rules require.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Politeness can combine the division?
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity this week erupted little civility in Washington.
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders brought no breakthrough on the big issues during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions will be taken longer had to employ.
After all, what is being said, it was neither a polite discussion between the two sides are still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan Punktesammelns.
The public meeting of the president's deficit commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months created a new mutual respect can the ideological divide that still divides the members disguised.
This is hardly enough to say that it is a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, even while trying to cross the borders of the public opinion and the patience of voters to weigh a renewed partisan warfare.
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself and its estimation by the participants limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep when a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could be expected.
No matter whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health or Anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election Washington has, at least for a short time bribed.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now on the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections appear partisan passions again.
This is so good."
In a number of issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have hardly any other choice than to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates.
Both sides want to find a way to make some or even all receive, whether temporary or permanent.
It is also expected to reach a compromise on the increased unemployment money, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while they are unemployed workers to refuse a support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that these issues during the "lame duck session" to reach an agreement and at the same time, the new Start treaty can be ratified.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session " soft must lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112. Congress convened in January.
Instead, he says, is a period of failure for huge likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, done, will transform this short-term psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation.
"I see many things from now on will be done by 2012, as a Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and the Teeparty-Wählern were instrumental to their education.
As the Republican leader also expressed concern may be that they vie to high, they know that they must try to keep their promise to cut government spending and the healthcare reform to set aside to adhere to.
This party lines are already in the first reaction on the recommendations of the deficit commission clearly what a fiscal reform and raised some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and cutting government spending include.
The stellvertretends Chairman Alan Simpson and Bowles Erskine have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington accepted and, according to their own assessment, pressed so much on the public agenda, the deficit issue, that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan for the official recommendation, and they are fighting very well to come only in the vicinity of these numbers.
The biggest resistance is reflected in the elected representatives of the body, because financial issues, at least today, little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead.
The first fight next year will take place in the form of Parteizusammenstößen, when the Republicans Obama on the state budget, taxes and challenging the health care system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together.
If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful to respect the public reaction.
Whoever wins will be doomed to lose, will change the course and the compromise must seek.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a major ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be at the same time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time to see the activists of the two parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence far broader election in 2012.
So it may be courtesy display this week will be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separate.
Durchgesickertes US-Dokument Moscow as a haven for corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and the protective benefits they einsammelt on the Kremlin. This reported in February, the US Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living in Moscow, it says.
They not only collect money from legitimate business, but also by organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money, which, according to the top of the ladder.
The memo under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday by Wikileaks published on its website.
The memo was based on sources, whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow's mayor was, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known operator has over the years makes repeatedly rejected, and he has won numerous libel actions against such accusations.
He told a Russian TV channel in September, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a dirty, dirty."
A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys show.
But it is unusual that, as has happened in the report of the ambassador, individual persons, and it is heard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link with the government in Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government is acting as a Kleptokrat rather than a government," as the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally" umbrella " or protection means) on the police, the Public Safety (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor onscreen as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure inside the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is uppermost."
"The FSB, the MVD and militia on the second stage."
"Finally, followed by the perfectly ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is an incompetent system, where criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city is offering no assistance."
The report says further that the FSB money received by the biggest companies and the police small businessmen have been arrested.
One source, so it is, "said that Moscow shopkeepers to understand that it is best to protect the MVD and FSB to get (and not by the organized crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs, not more sought-after as before."
The memo noted that while the collection of the money is fully protected even very modest no; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
The same people who do not pay, find their business very quickly closed - on the basis of one or other excuse.
Medvedev spoke several times to combat corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were presumably full with money, go in the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said named Georgy, who Satarov, director of by a Moscow expert commission recently in an interview.
"But it is part of this tape."
"It is not a part of the political class as a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without a politician without an opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says that corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, as estimated by the corruption is costing Russia, more than 300 Dollar billion per year.
The country is ranked 154, a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (the countries "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed).
The revelation of the Memos of the American Embassy, which after Moscow time late in the evening was done, it will certainly be sorry cause within the Russian government, though, because Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, the Kremlin may also be an opportunity to claim that one answer to the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN stated Putin that the WikiLeaks-Dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin said.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of internal politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we had not expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such pressure and such unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a weak brake betoniert class area with dirty and abblätternd walls, reminiscent of the director of the Anlong Veng High School in the man it has built in the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers," remains the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge hochburg popular in the north-west of Cambodia, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge against the government, are longtime supporters challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government circulated a school book for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community court condemned the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The fear grew with each of these developments under the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, complicating their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into the society in Cambodia.
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is dividing even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
In this case it until December 1998, when the last movement, to surrender unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary, the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok withdrew the next generation of Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990's, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, began major groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, with the government, resulting in the Kapitulationen by Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan of 1998 led.
Pol Pot died in 1998, a natural death, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains were arrested.
He died in 2006 in a prison of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
As their benefactors they no longer protected by default, the majority of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for justice and reconciliation throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng holds public forums
"They are embedded in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They are growing up without any professional know."
Sor Lim, 55, in 1974, joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager, had fought in the jungle at Anlang Veng, before moving in 1998 Lower left a life to lead as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has everyone to eat something in place."
"But now, life is difficult, because we have to care for ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also fomenting here concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, brought to trial.
The mandate of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for atrocities to be condemned, but it has not said whether it is on these four cases will pursue further action.
This has contributed little to ease fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation on the Chaem, 64 years concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey have been.
In 2007, it was representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, told me she was the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms led a project in which thousands of forced labourers probably died.
At a hot night came in the Chaem of the work in the fields with her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng back.
When the sun long shadow on the dried grass threw in the Chaem to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court vorladen them, so they would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no longer is war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878, fled from the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this matter.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means to collect the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to these broken parts together, so that they can understand how everything."
The centre has created the first school paper approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages "history of the Democratic Kampuchea."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history of the High School of the Education Ministry, fewer than four pages contains about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia to know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school paper, and the court will gain gradually influence," he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge here has a powerful attraction.
Likely leads in the Dangrek mountains, a Strauchs is rampant and plastic waste verdreckter route to a Rechteck of black soot covered with a rusty tin ceiling.
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 have been burned on a Reifenhaufen.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a cell phone verkäuferin at the roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people are going to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day, they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place to go where they will take a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that it brings her luck.
Belarus agrees not continue to collect weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it no longer will collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov announced in an additional article of the Sicherheitsgipfels.
The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared last spring reached a hurdle.
But the US administration officials told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus, 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium to remove from a White Russian research centre.
This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff, who will remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, roughly 500 pounds.
It seems one of the main findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" in April, the Belarus ruled.
And it was apparently good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012 to secure.
"I was thrilled by the fact that they have a seat at the nuclear security summit (by 2012) want."
"This shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement " a very significant, important step ' of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries, its highly enriched uranium to be loose.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit in the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamental weapons-grade, and fewer enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our raw materials... we will not make it a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone."
"We will use it solely for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus is still a few months ago, the United States, as interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte.
The first attempt to remove the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was irradiated easily, say officials.
It was loaded in a Spezialzug of more than 1 300 miles on a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials.
The second attempt was approved on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane.
The US government pays for these efforts - 14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research goes with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and concerted confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Department, which is working with the global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende Studies estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement to remove his camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harschen lack of respect for human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"According to the progress of this global security issues welcome liable to cancel out the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA with Taliban and Al-Qaida-Gefangenen on Spanish territory after Guantanamo as a telegram from the ambassador, S.A. emerges in Madrid.
This reflects the enhüllten of Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País " (cable) passed on documents, but it adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," is to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, will be monitored properly. "
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the subsidy on human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, have been indicted, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy leader admitted that the report of the Council, "Zapatero met on the sidelines" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the Geheimdienstflüge on Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," reported Aguirre cable.
It is also the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "wants to give this matter does not pay great attention, even though the government had little influence, because they would be in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez in January 2007, in turn, was to understand the message that he is the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense to request about the CIA would not block.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a meeting with the prosecutor.
However, the United States were on the "apparent coordination between the Spanish state prosecutor and the German prosecutors," more than on the deklassifizierte of the CNI information and the Defense Department.
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern our efforts will be complicated for discreet handling between governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassadors of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, describes the latter that "although the Spanish judges are considered incredibly strong on their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he indicated his staff was "blown rhetorical comments to avoid the tensions wane."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally proamerikanischen attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt from an indication that the government of Zapatero's actions of the United States as a possible human rights violations could be interpreted, tolerated or have deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the United States could," he stresses.
The Kindsmörderin, they have on the Internet about the "hardships" of motherhood.

They said that they take their first babies, if everything goes well.
"He will be where it should be, i.e., me. Never in life, I will do it again with anyone except my mother," a dubious intention, if we take into account their bad relationship.

She was, however, confessed César drowned in the bathtub and his body in a suitcase.

Popular Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the Lérida towns, Tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role
After the major voices and fellow gains in the last regional elections executes its view the PP already on the parliamentary elections - early or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan Popular Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - a result of the diversion of the share of PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP - should continue, analysts predict the PP in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise by 8 to 12 Congressmen who are, while also CiU four (it now has 10) added to win and the PSC at least 9 members (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - it currently has three, while ICV to keep their members or a way to go win.
If the electoral calendar will be maintained, however, the next date with the local elections in May 2011. Even then can the People's Party (PP) to be the voice of the scales to put an end to the socialist hegemony, and in four Provinzhauptstädten, and with their majority in the council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities of Barcelona, Tarragona Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists or reach a majority on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can fall back on, will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party their representation in the council, in which they reach 5% of the votes should lose.
The PP, however, recorded an increase in their share in the four Provinzhauptstädten and could lead to a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the key role to play in Tarragonas turnaround to be able to where they were before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the People's Party ruled.
En Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC, Àngel Ros, the mayor maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign, they met several times.
There are also other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the People's Party gained a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and is seeking the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell was Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers in the intelligence department of the police detainees Pakistanis and Nigerians constituted the Thailand managed dschihadistische cell, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam " (LTTE) and" Laschkar e-Taiba " (let) - the latter was the writer of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - provided with passports.
The Spanish interior minister attributes great importance to this investigation, which so far is that he assured, with the "operation Kampai" is the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas in the world "weakened" and "thus their ability to act."
The researchers estimate that in the two years in which the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports have been sent to Thailand, where these fake and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda composed, have been sent out, so that their "freedom fighters" with the borders of European and other Western countries have been able to cross.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadi network, which has been active in Europe, which is why, apart from the Thai investigative bodies also other European police forces involved in the investigation, which is not to say that on the territory of the EU in the coming days to similar attacks as the last Tuesday in Barcelona said, will come.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun Atiqur Rehman Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) was in Thailand conducted a further, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar of flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan of flounder, as well as Thais from the country Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They were from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries established cell led.
The Catalan Network - a part of it was destroyed in the year 2009 has been - in particular stole tourists passports in accordance with the stipulations of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 years to be issued, and even several years had to be valid; they were allowed to run any Visastempel.
In pre-trial circles stresses that until now no links between the detainees and the terrorist attack in Mumbai could be proven, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was one of the beneficiary groups in Spain stolen and then fake passports in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia from several thousand dollars via a geldtransfer company had been sent in the purchase of Prepaid-Karten for mobile phones were "invested," later by the members of the "Kommandos" the lives of 106 people at an end, were used.
The police has seized an extensive documentation.
PP Ma's calls for a postponement of the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to Artur Ma's personal their conditions for the support of his assumption of office as prime minister to present the Generalitat. These do not differ from the already during the election campaign raised and the primacy of the economic recovery and the regionalist Unabhängigkeitsabenteuern as a financial compensation agreement, the leaders at the culmination of his mandate, proposing to assemble.
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party opposing Mas with the security of Artur awarded her the 18 MEPs, which they won on Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel indispensable because, as the candidate of the Civic regionalistischen CiU party is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties in the vote abstained on his assumption of office.
The future alliances turn in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress intend to depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks, Mr. Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the leader of the PPC is concerned, it calls for the support of the inauguration of "all discourse, which affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia," as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - as in the Basque Country - and the leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, to be employed at the back.
Both political leaders are common, that they exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and want to abolish death duties and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Ma's deal on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors.
Mas has already spoken with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which announced a harsh opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV hit) today, he will be with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) to meet.
The elderly care home confirmed that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot does not preclude their carers on 11 elderly people killed
The people in charge of the elderly nursing home in La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which she highlighted what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - had caused the institution.
The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, came in the company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat would like to thank the people responsible (for the deaths) tribunal," but "the right and our liability force us into the process and the civil liability" to adopt.
The institution must not only accept a social prestige lost, because they are the criminal activities of the nurses had not detected in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime is falling in August 2009, and that he had murdered since even further.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight Körpern - former patients of the elderly nursing home - because he thought that no doctor examined the dead personally, but the paperwork because of their age and disease have been handled by phone.
The head of La Caritat flatly prominent writers have expressed this point and said that "the lack of action in no time, the reason could have been for the events."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the litigation for negligent acts were a different person than the defendant."
The already as "Angel" Getaufte confessed the day 11 killings and said the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have been murdered.
In this case he was killed with an overdose of insulin, compared to the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives had.
The head of La Caritat, said the staff access to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative middle cocktail suspended the carers in six of the nine crimes a to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests will point out whether Vila is lying and for its first victims actually chose a less cruel death, or whether he ausbrannte them from the inside by calling them bleich lauge forecast was, as it had done, according to three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat listens to the statements of the carers no faith, not even as far as the number of confessed murder, which could well be more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court and that it make no sense, his approach after eight successful assassinations to suddenly change.
They say they stood up for this reason and investigating the scope of these incidents of justice available.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted yesterday sharp on the threat of ECB President Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity."
The risk premia have risen dramatically in the Euro-Peripheriländer and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should have the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro has gained little points, which led to concern, not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market in the deal, in which he collapses recovers, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors do not lose his fear.
Now a month ago, the European Central Bank urged on us to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, must make a U-turn.
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan for the purchase of government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should only be a week's indefinite access will be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March," extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access on the quarterly of the year in order to guarantee the liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued and will spend a reinforcing message.
If the managed expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, can only God help us!
Like the EZB-Sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities do not need to be considered and then collapsed, the markets could repeat this story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and tenacious.
In May, they showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said to have bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year government permits in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management was only 500 million at 5,28%, compared with 750 million at 4,81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal in the whole curve and thus reflected a perceptual change the markets after the words Trichet's reflect that.
In Ireland were the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland published.
The amount is approximately 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after the problem with the stress tests had not detected in July, the figures are acceptable within the framework of the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government Tuesday received parliamentary approval to his new budget, but the fact that they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has its discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and the government of moderate shaped on 14 December where it needed political unity in order to show that we shared the same score to play.
The problem is that Germany, Wagner wants to play and the other countries of the Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish government minister yesterday asked the action plan, which is due to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis sound for four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result.
Today, there is an authoritative auction of three-year bond, which benefit from the trichet effect, and that is why we put on a strong demand, which remove all doubts about our debt-restructuring capacity.
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan is a self-sacrifice.
We get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. the interest rates are very expensive and would get access to the markets closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto "Caesar's wife:" now what counts is not only his, but also on the bill. "
Only the courage that we create!
The CEO of Eules fechtet at the request of his children, the company assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Alvarez, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, is not slowing.
David Alvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, the company Assembly of El Enebro, at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th place will contest because it "absolutely null and void" Euroskeptical. His children will try to get a majority, the administrative arm of the company - winner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia - vineyards are able to control.
David Alvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare legal measures for a new justice chapter in their dispute over the control of any part of the business group.
The founder of the largest holdings of corporate services seems not to be ready in his legal battle for the control of the institutions of El Enebro to concede.
He was from the board of five of his seven children out on the rails. These appointed at the shareholder meeting on 18 January this year, the trade register already is registered as a contest to board members.
The company Assembly of El Enebro by the judges of the Court No 2 of Madrid called for the 16, has a new thunderclap Alvarez triggered in the bosom of the family.
The referral of the judges on the announcement of the assembly is the only legal way to guarantee the convening of the Company meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta Elvira y Alvarez Mezquiriz of David Alvarez as a "desperate funding of applicants - his five children - interpreted through legal technicalities, fraudulent practices and legal abuse annulled Assembly from 18 January to recognize" as official spokesman to explain.

This is the real background of the issue, on which the judge in the hearing on the treatment of the legal challenge, for which no date has been set to decide.
Red Bull win with a secret weapon by Siemens
The car will be improved with a software program in real-time.
For Red Bull in 2004 in the world of F1 is their history in the elite universe shaped the speed of surprises and successes.
The newcomer from the outset, nobody paid attention and, despite its precipitous ratings rising record set during the last season in the final sprint last November, all in the victory for the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilot and Weltmeisters Sebastian Vettel or performance is to belittle the engine from Renault want is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become to the legend.
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company 2007 purposes, which do not have to do with motor racing, brought to the market.
This call as a PLM computer program was for the development of Monday chains in factories in the world, Energiewerken and precise tools.
Intention is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built so as to avoid errors and unnecessary expense.
PLM the development of the cameras by Canon, the aircraft from Sukhoi, and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan, relieved.
Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the F1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements in the race and will be found in the tests, can design and implement.
Russwurm notes that in 1992 in the Rennstalls an average of ten technicians working in a season at most three or four improvements could introduce.
In Red Bull's team now employs 180 highly qualified young people. They lead with powerful EDV-Anlages analyses and all possible changes to the cars through.
The Siemens manager said that the PLM-Software should be in the situation, all components of the Red Bull cars to analyse and improve, with the exception of the engine, in which Renault is exclusively responsible said.
The materials, the fuel for dynamics and safety elements to be changed.
The changes can, thanks to advanced production facilities and Hightech-Autoklaven within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulator will be transferred into reality.
The only border, which is set to this crazy technically perfect, 40 million dollars, a Formula 1 - team must spend on his race in a season.
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a 50 kilometers away from the ground built by London.
There are two buildings where visits - especially journalists - are severely limited.
Everything what is happening is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's real Formula 1 - hero is zweifelslos the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the vast technological resources of energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation on the race tracks, there are other players, whose support is invaluable, and whose fame is nil.
The Technologichef of the plant, Steve Nevey, stresses that you could still say five years ago, that the progress in the field of R & D for cars with 50 per cent contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology makes 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."

Saba dell wants to its rival in three years, a million customers 'klauen '
The executive director of Banco saba dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but a new liquidity crisis initially rejects and predicts the end of the Schuldenkriegs.

This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their private customers.
This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies get.
Your market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, or rather Austerität, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank so that it is facing, it will present, along with annual Summary.
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times set targets and to publish as a result of the financial crisis all global banks' plans are disrupted.
Saba dell this year its flagship plan established four years ago Optima finish. This was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a business year.
The customers who left the savings banks, the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great scope."
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "work to create" - essential for the survival of the banks.
Although he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest rate margins punished - will wane, raise risk premia, banks and thrifts must pay for their emissions to the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for loss of profit margins have already passed on the cost of borrowing.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are structural in nature, and they will exert pressure on the credit."
"We have not marginalised Hahn, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," were Guardiola.
Banesto was on Thursday ordering its subsidiary network, to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz report on 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged a currently pursued by the banks of the Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a framework that have been shaped by the competition."
Saba dells guiding plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is no coincidence that he assured that in Spain "more companies are necessary."
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "huge increases" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions are slipping into red figures.
He is of the opinion that Kaptitalaufstockungen FROB could replace the money market.
After he assured that saba dell also can survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument by some bankers, who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can be put into circulation, but compared to the events in June, could be short-term funding beyond Repogeschäfte reach, and hence the crisis.
CECA includes a second merger wave of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed the possibility that it could come to a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, insisted several savings and to not participate in the first phase, which won the second round.
On the other hand assured the Director-General of the Spanish Savings and Loan Association (CECA), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the biggest part of the merger is completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica could not be regarded as the second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The biggest part is finished. It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all important processes are already completed. you were from Banco de España, which strongly supports all processes controlled."
In one of the association of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast led Olavarrieta from the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiry in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been established," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 thrifts with an average of 28 000 million asset was on 17 with ever 75 500 million is a historic incomparable process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62 percent, and they are now very much bigger, thereby fulfilling the Basel agreements we have," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed because "Banco de España exhorted us on schedule to be completed before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain is one of the rigorous most financial systems in Europe and "perhaps" was all over the world, and added that those who anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge" would do.
The manager said that we in the current economic upturn "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks must make a "very significant" concentration process have gone through, "as quickly as possible" will be completed.
He also recalled that the Spanish bank stress tests, the ECB carried out in July, were very good.
Zapatero and the red line in Germany
Berlin has opted for the of, keeping the euro, but at the same time the conditions set for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have triggered a dual response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation presented, beginning with tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 million support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, referring to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat, as well as 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand supports the Deputy Head, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, calls have been made to get the current crisis.
How are these events to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
It takes Germany a fundamental new perspective on the shape of our future, with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis on spekuliern.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second point: the restoration of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50 percent of the population.
The third point: a transformation of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budget; the punishment of the countries that overstep the targets; möglicher as the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time, and that is why there are no excuses.
First of all, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission to provide incentives for deficits in the past and the German government is a constitutional reform has withdrawn from the case, in order to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw fit (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel the decision on the rescue of Greece is also more than painful.
At the time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally against a rescue of Greece.
Merkel is finally in the last Oktobertags again with a clear position, which calls for a reform of the agreements between the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time to commit the private lender to bear a portion of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because they Ireland crisis and propelled all the following.
But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, Parliament approved in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, these measures should enable from 2013, participate.
Germany has drawn a red line not to cross does.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - from the date of the old workings of the euro will be no more.
In 2013 it will be the birth year of a new monetary area in which the offender countries be punished harshly, may be forced to declare itself insolvent and in this case, the private sector must take a share of the cost.
Germany shows us that we must take a hard growth rate, high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative to debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as they led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do wrong to not understand it.
It is not just about the public deficit to three percent by 2013 runterzufahren.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst of all, what we could do under these circumstances is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil to move into more calm.
And that we have the opportunities that are available to us, until the spring of 2013 will use.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies on last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesis to create order in your own home, is getting its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything.
Among the options taken into account is that the euro area packed with little serious countries would have to leave, not be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us they have warned us.
Sport and regulatory tax evasion
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax of show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction.
The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the game on 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that there was a lot of ink about whether it is an unsporting act or not acted upon and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, lost two players for a few minutes of the game of the year (her team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the referee they showed the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would cite his group, the two players the prescribed sanction against the Auxerre meet in the next league game and so without maps in the next room for stage boarding.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary kommitee, Jose Mourinho, the coach of the club with two games and the participating players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this game -.
Part of the debate about the portrayed event is due to the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (the find and honor claims in its national anthem and on other occasions for similar incidents had punished his players) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this is not explicitly prohibited behaviour by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, which is to say whether these actions constitute a virtual evasion. Indeed, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but they seem to evade its terms.
In this matter should damage the spirit of the sport will be investigated.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offender players an unwarranted benefit from the team, and this did not happen.
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulatory evasion, since the circumvention of the rule was not taken secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited eagerly and sanction attended.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender went from the deliberate Fouls.
Here, it should be stressed that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still an advantage for the played game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with a few players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, then the club lacks these players.
The advantage is obvious is that the players the next ground phase of the Champions League without tickets, which could threaten their participation in a future game begin.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could also be absent at some point, and we get the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second cycle on where they are for card acquisition disappeared with a card less than in the first cycle.
Thus, it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive from the rules for a maximum benefit.
In this case, the players did not want any sanction deal (which would indeed be a clear case of regulatory tax evasion), they wanted to elect more when they undergo these.
They met a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her.
Although the line is blurred between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it involved two Selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the regulatory operation.
The damage of the principles of the sport was caused by these acts is less moral rather than aesthetic nature.
Supply offensive to the customer fishing for Gruppen-Weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year can be an avalanche of reservations fall on days 16 and 17 December.
The staff even paid celebrations are spreading. They do not want more than 20 to 30 euros to spend.
As the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery in the runup to Christmas again block dinner, the hotel and leisure industry to bring oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, they solve a price offensive, including the customer segment, which represents the large mass: almost all want to between 20 and 30 million to spend for a lunch or dinner, confirm the interviewed entrepreneurs and associations.
Thus, the bookkeeping is still a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) all orders to fall in the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner in two Spitzentager (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before that.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinner for budgetary reasons.
In order to abandon this tradition to have to pay for many workers those from their own pockets.
As the economy is always required rock-bottom prices, confirmed the chairman of the Gaststättengremiums of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Apparel dares until now do not predict how the holidays will look into this month.
"The people consider there are tens of times before they get."
"You would like to run out, but they respect strong prices," he stresses.
The deal will be good to go, "the quality to offer a good service at good prices," he adds, and we are reminded that the clients save in a time of economic crisis, which is why prices at 25 euros are most in demand.
In a survey in various central restaurants turns out that the night of 17 December suppliers will lead to the collapse.
The group Soteras, says the demands for this Friday with the intention of less than 30 euros to spend, would be going gangbusters. The group has its Menüs with complete offered between 25 and 35 million adapted to the economic cycle.
In any other leading group Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar into early reservations, even from the beginning of November, conducted.
"We have squared the year-on-year prices with Menüs for every taste of 19.95 until 30 euros to maintain," he says.
In AN Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local guides, they will not lose the optimism after blooming for the second quarter of the revenue back and well, albeit in a few days ago focused outlook for the Christmas season could receive is perceived.
Sources of the corporate group stress that even the 18th a more active day with friends groups, the Christmas vorfeiern.
Among the six Gruppenmenüs was a Christmas menü for 30 euros or more than Preishit, it added. One has the impression that the customers are ready, 10 percent more than in the previous year spending and in turn want more details, such as Cava.
Even in some companies see green shoots grow into why the employees will be invited back. This gives the impression that the group to eat again on the upswing.
The umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with mergers such as the Kneipen-, restaurant and leisure federation of Barcelona), the deputy chairman of the familiar, Enric Gomà, to see the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations generally are "lively," although customers "a maximum out beat."
However, the fun at the celebration was not decreased, regardless of who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme which has aroused great concern in the US
Islamabad is nuclear weapons "faster than every other country ago."
Revelations of Wikileaks confirms relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The website Wikileaks is revealing the content of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the US Treasury Department confirmed what enormous concern about the Pakistani nuclear program with Washington.
In the margins of the moment and details the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, offer these reveal that the cooperation between the two countries on nuclear safety will not be increased, but on the contrary "diminishing," and that the volatile Asian country more nuclear weapons "to a faster Rhytmus than any other country" manufactures.
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not met, but its individual pieces stored in order to hinder its destruction in a possible attack - put Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Petersen, in a report before the visit by the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities on the area attacked by the Taliban, probably Verstreuung of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transportation of nuclear materials."
The large passenger numbers are implied in the nuclear arsenal and missile program, is no longer just from the United States, but also by Russia as a megalomaniac and reason to be cautious, has not been seen.
"Pakistan must strictly observant staff to guard nuclear installations; as a result of the low educational and cultural levels have extremist organisations more opportunities people who participate in nuclear or ballistic missile programs, to reklutieren," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
A new feature of the website Assanges by Julian reveals documentation is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in terms of nuclear proliferation wanes and the increased pace, producing nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
In May of an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" describes, explains: "Often there is no transparency; we get no answers for assistance or they will be rejected."
In another announcement confirms Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Agency for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country has produced."
The ambassador Petersen asks Washington during a visit by the top Heeresleiters, General Ashfaq Kayani, the country's political leaders "to clarify" that "Pakistan's army its tacit excess support for terrorist groups to recruit."
In the pursuit of Wikileaks boss
Obama will appoint a senior person responsible for the anti-terrorist campaign on the prevention of new revelations.
Interpol is a red alert has been issued for the prosecution and location of Assange.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange connected forms a complicated maze where only difficult to investigate the facts.
Yesterday Interpol, a "red warning" to "locate and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional layout on the arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States to do, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden.
The lawyer also assured the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they came into contact with Mr. Assange could absorb."
As early as 20 gave the international police agency located in Lyon (France) at the request of the Swedish Order, but until yesterday after the receipt of the power it was not announced by the Swedish authorities.
That is how things stand. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify Assange and, presumably, "in order to arrest him on a preliminary basis and hand them over."
Although Interpol for the arrest of a person hit by a red warning may not see many member countries according to the organisation of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably finds himself.
The action empörte Assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which they are about it, the 39 year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange exit from Sweden, and the prosecutor with the shrouded Pavlovich Lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorization was given.
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter.
While it seeks the world - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange clings to an unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday he was the head of the Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location for an interview. In the interview he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the United States.
"If it can be proven that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations, and thus against the United States to sign an international agreement has infringed, they should resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a guy with a website should," he told CNN.
Obama himself has a highly responsible for the anti-terrorist campaign, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new Dokumentenenthüllungen.
The attempt by the spokesman of the side that those responsible for Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, stands in contrast to the views, the conservative politicians and commentators proclaim in these days.
The Congressman Peter King, from January the chair of the House of Representatives in the national security kommitee, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks to put on the list of terrorist organisations, "in order to seize their money, and everyone who supported or contributes to follow."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange must "be killed" revoked.
"Obama should transform him into a target and is not a manned aircraft or so what use."
Anyone who has not apologized, Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Who else was in the government leaked information, it is the treason and everything that is not an execution is eiine mild punishment," he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close the social peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret ballot on his continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the Vollversammlungsprinzips.
Joan Puigcercós a recipe seems to have found, for the umpteenth time of internal turmoil in the ranks after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes from landmark unemployed ERC from the way to go.
The leader is aware that his resignation threat to close the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor himself and he is not the same headaches in store for us, as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra trying to win with a nod to the new critics, what his position until the next local elections would secure.
Kündete for the start yesterday, that the more than 200 regional members of ERC about his stay in the office could comment secret.
With ballot papers, not with gehobener hands.
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen with a fine, they could do this without needing to fear repression.
Indeed, would head both the impression of divisions, as well as the submission to avoid him.
In several interviews, he confirmed he would with half of the votes plus one not vindicated, and he added without giving any percentage levels, a result "in the Bulgarian style" is not good.
The Carod urged the social demand from the president more than just provide the party office. An inadequate gesture, because Puigcercós is the supreme body of the congresses controlled.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority for the promotion of resignations, it will be with the board a course plan from now until May agreed.
To this end, they expect in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that leadership on 18 will submit to the Council to vote can participate.
It is your intention to guarantee for Puigcercós. In turn this should promise the congress in the autumn of 2011, which already holds the leader of a fait accompli.
The leader of the ERC is of the view that the "Polyphonie" shame of the stability and wants forever, to bring the organization in the position to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, the incumbent Conseller, Josep Huguet wrote in his blog, in typical fashion.
Against this backdrop, the Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació felt that it was a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives will be supported."
He was five, and two of them in the foreground.
First of all, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that it takes at least 90 percent of party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes ERC should the full assembly principle as the operation scrapped.
In so doing, he verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the conferences with elected delegates.
From the end of the Vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós ' team, which is already in the last two congresses fought like mad.
Indeed, at the bebend Assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the Vollversammlungsprinzips at a congress should deal with the reform of the statute instructs.
This date is still, as infogle of the internal Aufruhe of the last few years tackling this issue was not advisable.
Now, without which the critical sectors are on the lookout, the time has come to address this matter again and forever to complete.

"With your vote, in which we wait, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was disseminated after the 42 Republican senators androhten to block all voice for every law except the extension of tax rebates from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade at one of the 42 Republican senators signed letter was announced, might affect the vote of the dream Act - thousands and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia to combat nuclear proliferation.
The blockade of the law's Republican dream Act and other projects have been questioned, said presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs, he trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be established.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be completed before the end of the year..."

Another Republican who voted for the bill, John McCain, has not yet defined its position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
The finger in the wound with literature
The second round of the mood of the language " was a walk in the narrative, in which the participants made strong
"The sex in the language, of course, I understand, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua " should open a cycle, which celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and on this occasion the subtitle of her question was used (at another event was the round table devoted to the sex in the language, she said).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in difficulty," the Argentine Schriftstellein sweet, spuckte the audience to join suspended mainly from young people at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) met this moderate Marisol Shultz attend roundtable in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela, read a text before they Gonzalo Celorio and Shultz later characterized as a great narrative. Luisa told in first person, and is the champion, who is on the lookout to find out what a "wound," and from doctor to doctor, from which they have no answer, but gets the references to the guidance of its narrative.
According to the Infektologen leaves them convinced: "Patience is not my strength, which is perhaps my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the clinical trauma theorists of her in the middle of the Ganges, raubte and her but says that wound is not a scientific concept, the Psychoanalytiker enthült the mystery: "The wound is really open, the symbolic scar."
The main character in the narrative and relieved sighs, she "just heard from the wound, that this really is open and does not exist." but she is convinced that the mood of the language and its pitfalls mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez also asked a delightful narrative before he 'Lob the invention ' was called, and where the finger in the wound not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress touching the clouds, well travelled men back brought or restored the lost virtue of a girl. The narrative made a U-turn and told of America, the big novel from the outset not lacked its own Chronist, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the abundance of stories told by the Eroberen criticism.
"Cervantes us all (the writer), spot the false witness, as True presented stories appeared, but in other ways, the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, could manage even the embarrassment was lost."
However, he stresses, "madmen and liar, which is the best way to present things," and there are nearing reality and lie to each other, where we do not know which side of the narrative is one where the fictional literature reached the summit.
He calls the real 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, which will be told."
When Mayra Montero in the series, the writer commented on and praised the diversity of interpretations with which the invitation of the FIl on the round table ' the finger in the wound " had contributed.
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin, their contribution to the great wound of societal violence, which affects their country - as the whole of Latin America - as a result of fighting the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, not deliberate commitment contained," she said, after she had stressed that literature communications and engagement between the author and the readers how to build a "chemical reaction."
According to the evening decided the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He said that even the intellectual habits in a fast-moving world, and the control of the awareness on dogmatism. Rather amount and forget "that behind every confirmation a small 'no' is a small" yes "and" behind every denial. "
"If we owned our idea and the reality we have to be clarified: and Nuancieren often meant to put the finger in the wound and harass those who, if they feel much more comfortable in the form of cartoons in black and white, prefabricated ideas without notes, and also to harass the powerful prefer the world in black and white, he said, and invited a rediscover the spirit of the letter.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three failures at Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he played three crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey also are in the final two different, different styles imposed by their respective coaches towards, and their meeting marked by differences of opinion is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three failures at Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he has three crucial games had, and he has so far kept well why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinians has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners, and surprisingly, he has fought successive Endspiels with the same team.
The santistische strategist, reached the first final as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002 ' than del Morelia had the lead in the hand with which he against Toluca 4-2 learned a great defeat; later, in the 'Clausura 2003 " it reached the decisive match, which he also lost against Rayados 3-1.
As early as with Santos, Laguna 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', in which it against Los Diablos, played Rubén again had to share a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros equalised after 210 Spielminuten, but he was in the penalty kick with 3-1 forward and got two options, accepting his title, but ultimately missed three of his players and the game of the 11 steps on a 4-3.
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one in Monterrey, his great rival, lost, and so he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid themselves of the bad attention in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the most important thing for him to play the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics for a club, for my love, I am hingebe, and that is why the title will come to me, but what previously happened, is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when they questioned him about the lost Endspiels.
The last final in the recall him is still strong, he assured, to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee is not the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared for the line, the players, too, because the last time with two Elfmetern, we were already prepared to order, and I believe that this is a lesson to be learned before the game is not finished, there is no cause for celebration."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, concerned him not because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, we were prepared in the previous Tournee, but unfortunately we gave a bad game the destiny, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for the endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso power, not just its second champion and costs for the first time the glory of the title.

The clandestine immigration could easily be prosecuted
The bill for the Conservatives, according to the government, the problem is to regulate the ships laden with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be scrapping after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
"I reject strongly against the charter."
"I think with a party you laid at the feet," said Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberal Democrats, after the expiry of the weekly caucus meeting before the assembled Members.
The liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows each one as the transportation of illegal immigrants identified Seeschiff next person up to a year in their sights, as proposed by the Canadian legal and custodial constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Québécois, as suggested, not being able to support the bill, as he would like to turn against the wrong target.
"We are against it, and it seems that all opposition parties are, so we will wait to see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism on the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, the NDP has shown the critics of the hand, calling for their party would not firm enough against the clandestine immigrants.

The new unit will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new frame unity on the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claimed this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue.
The metropolis has at its disposal for fastest on a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement on Wednesday was more than just a surprise.
We must say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils has not been discussed in the slightest.
It also lacked not due to the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and a member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "gezaubertes rabbit from the hat" and "a table of the Council rightly cobbled solution" to qualify.
Minister Dutil did turn appealed to those who fear that the political power to much influence on the contest took responsibility for the future unity.
"You will see the result, if we will announce it," he was to confirm.
"We are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public opinion poll.
"The more insistent M. Charest, to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry to try to, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest" so, in turn, said Yves bois, a teacher of ethics and policy systems of the ENA (staatl. high school for the training of senior administrators).
In order to emerge from this impasse, proposing the Quebec, to give a specific mandate from the financial auditing control, so that the appropriate investigations into corruption and collusion can make.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," as he decided.
He also takes the view that the Quebec of audit control the same powers as commissioners could give, which would also allow her to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the penal code to better at this type of crime to be stopped.
This demand comes from the public prosecutor in the Operation Marteau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, minister for public security, for its part, confirmed his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, currently committed to certain portfolio offending update apart.
During the operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of Motorradpolizisten, 131 people have been arrested, although the criminal law has not been revived.

Dupont sometimes reprimanded
The Quebecer radio when Stéphane Dupont told the Canadian board for broadcasting standards (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as on radio because of his ausfällig speaking a partial setback.
The CCNR takes the view, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM-Team had the right to own expression, however, would have been certain statements "inaccurate information about the social care and unwarranted negative images of the Haitians, and also included such a crude speaking as a daytime broadcast programmes is not appropriate."
The board also gave final concluded that a discussion about suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two persons who have committed suicide in breach of the code of the radio transmission.
The CCNR had several complaints concerning the during the period between 2008 and 2010 broadcast recordings made the comments received.
The first European Initiative was as a result of a complaint of "Front commun of personnes assistées sociales du Quebec."
The activist organization had complained that the figures presented in the programme were inaccurate.
Instead, the hosts should have solid information as misleading.
With regard to the issue of suicide was moderator Stéphane Dupont view, suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the aufsichtsrat members had concluded that the message here is that suicide is not allowed to be seen as a solution of life crises.
"The majority of the board of directors considered that the question of a future impact of the programme" Dupont le midi "a sensitive issue in family fair and appropriate way would have been raised."
It was therefore with no recrimination against his person proves.
According to the latest point of contention was the statements, which were related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Mr. rené Dufort had in this respect supplied a headline-grabbing argument that have caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-Moderator was declared not to have donated for the benefit of the Haiti aid, because we do not know with certainty whether the people in need actually receive the donations would be.
The board is of the opinion that these comments are not abusive nature were, but their cumulative effect presenting a false negative portrayal of the Haitians.
"I already have my three-day suspendierung penalty abgebüßt in this matter."
"My act is virgin for one and a half years," said the presenter.
In all the resolutions of the board of directors denounces the dissemination of crude language.
In all cases was the CHOI-FM broadcast ansager "beyond its obligations" and sold.
The consequences for the radio station, including its decisions unique during prime time within a period of three days had intended to announce are minor.

"I have 12 years ago in Algeria with combat sports such as Kung-Fu and kick-start boxing started," said Zemmal, since 2008 is based in the metropolis to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the fight, because those ground campaign, as it mixed fighter kunsts present dislike competitions in North America are scarce."
I recently had his mark as a security officer working, as well as the company UPS complained employed bad news given his rival, in which he between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, hosted two World Cup gold medal of the World Karate, as well as the kick-start boxing Association (WKA).

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec mutual understanding Projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts that have been approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the major proportion, namely the project pipeline, has received a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" was in 2004 as a side effect of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector for their responsibility in this important hydroelectric project a sum amounting to 5 billion dollars to entrust formed.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium ergatterte 'Énergie gérance' the lucrative contract without that there had been a public invitation to tender.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to Unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, which evokes the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of conspiracy and distorted the competition."
"This means that rather than fix games rather than in a secret manner is now carrying out in an open way," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a delegate of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the interests of the public can be used in this way.
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by they vehemently deny, that it is a conspiracy in this treaty would have acted.
"I am sticking to my faithful," they raged by them confirmed that PQ was "dishonest" raiding "and lacked rigour."
She said it "is the least we can do," the PQ.
The model of the consortium is world practice.
It is usually such a temporary alliance the two or more companies allowed their expertise on an imperative to concentrate on a tender for a complex project.
The project " East main ' a high komplexität level indicates about his Arbeitsausmaßes.
This is well under way and construction techniques should be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competitive campaign had can take place; it had already negotiations were held.
It also represents the model of the consortium in Quebec even relatively simple projects by no means an exception.
As the newspaper 'Le Devoir' last week noted that in the field of civil engineers and Beratungswesens used model of the consortium are the subject of Regierungsermittlungen.
A brief overflying the Quebecer Unternehmensregisters allowed more than 200 consortia to appoint, some of which seem to be steady duration.
In this way works, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, CIMA, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roach and Tecsult also count together.
Any link, and there are several dozen leads to a and the same legal person back, namely Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance," as Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special Arbeitskräftedynamik and Hydro-Québec this fact since the 1970s in a particular way account pays."
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has issued a statement that the nose has right now on the fact that the treaty was approved after agreement on the project pipeline.
"If you makes a call for tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices will soar."
"So you have two options: either you nimmst the people who find themselves at the Mart and saying:" we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price. "
"The idea is, however, that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte.
This consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50 000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After reviewing the newspaper 'Le Devoir' more than 100 Ingenieurs and consultancy contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular Ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been awarded.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without here their participation in "gérance" count Énergie.
All these treaties have been negotiated.
In total they amount to 449,783,344 dollars, including the treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295,131,564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Quebec well-known."
Minister Normandeau had let slip the PQ is equally associated with the firms they "finance" before she clarified that it is acting contrary to their leaders.
Barometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not confidence-inspiring
Green, but clearly skeptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither the marked brands or the Öko-Kennzeichnungen, which will manage its election.
It is a shame, while swimming in a media universe where information for the benefit of a responsible more consumption just so: the barometer responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a failure as a brake makes his commitment displayed as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although it is the consumption of so-called social friendly products have driven in the year 2010, the Quebecer nonetheless seem those who try to sell them to pay little credit.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population is in fact the environment-friendly companies to pay as little faith as the green corporate advertising, so does the responsible Consumer Centre of the University of administered brooke sophisticated measuring instrument.
Another record: half of the consumer doubts about the credibility of the official supposedly fair products included certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which turned out to be environmentally conscious, so the barometer.
Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only 14,6% of Quebecer population seriously.
The information about responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this Konsumsegments, which is currently around only one-third of Quebecer users crowded.
In fact, dämpften Blank and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
After the higher price of the product, this is the second obstacle identified by the barometer.
There is also a third of the Quebecer of the specified performance of green products and services that they are trying to put in the hands of distrust.
According to a different communication was already over half of consumers have changed their habits in the year 2010 and predominantly the brand of several products or defected to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they were also 61% preferred purchases with dealers in their districts, and the purchase of food grown favoured in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of ecological consumption had this year a 64 to achieve the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of the Quebec loves to present himself as the king of recycling, which is trying to reduce left traces in the environment by he cares about the welfare of animals.
But the social and ecological consciousness seems nonetheless to stop his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated that in the year 2010, public transportation, or the Mitfahrzentrale preferred to have in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The walking and cycling were also 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey supports the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government of Société Angus and called on the company Parallèle has been financially to participate in the takeover of the eXcentris Kinokomplexes agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The Angus entwickler society, as well as the company Parallèle a donation amounting to seven million dollars from the Ministry for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois covered by Kinokomplexes eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint laurent had hoped to bring this back to his real cineastischen capacity to respond, do not seem to get what they demanded.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government instead of a loan at less than the initial desired level, a viable solution to create favorable conditions could, at least according to the entnehmbaren sources from the state-owned scaremongers.
An initial action plan and a request for 12.8 million were already last spring by the Quebec rejected a further request has been made since the renewed layoff moderately revised downwards.
One proposal, along with an action plan has already been the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St-Pierre Minister, who chairs the eXcentris act.
Before several days, he had her a grant last factual report.
The counter-proposal of the cabinet, the SODEC was sent on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, it seems that the premise of public donation really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebecer owner's community theatres and cinema complex against a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by making the argument invalid, the Culture Minister did not have any financial help for real estate projects there, which he did not even other cinemas to send.
Several other players in the segment, however, in contrast to substantial economic aid one.
Movie chief Daniel Langlois was after the self-financed design of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the authors' cinemas presented in the premises of his Kinokomplexes, which could justify the exception from the public purse.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients in the bar.
Société Angus and the company with Christian Yaccarini Parallèle at the top, for their part, are heading for a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum of 700, 000 dollars, hoping to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009 drives for just a single screen so that continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirer, the three Kinosäle on 27 February next year with the spectacle of a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois " I hommes et des dieux ' to reopen.
Christian Yaccarini, the newspaper 'Le Devoir' is not removed and ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals that we made them.
Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American Diplomatenleitungen, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel toward the Americans; but they put the the latter superiority with the same blow against Canada open.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, not the kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government, their Budget of 2009 to enforce!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were prevalent yesterday publicly offer even more juicy details than the mere substantive content, with which it has a very bad outcome.
A previous link on 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was currently in full swing, reported from what point the United Nations is not more of the operations involved discussed by their political bosses.
With regard to the great surprise of David Wilkins of Ottawa deployed American ambassador.
Mr. Wilkins offers various channels in this situation.
"One of the Canadians are almost inherent inferiority complex conditional leads possibly the Canadian political leaders far more on internal issues of everyday life to talk as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on free trade) ," as he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to talk to him."
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," as he assessed, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a leader to drive such processes relationship, which the voters at the polls as a key factor in the mind."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, written communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare.
"Your visit will help the survival of the government in a confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February to ensure that the Canada its first budget deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a recovery programme in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars has arisen," describes Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had parliamentary session before Christmas must be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed Belebungsprogramms.
Another, from January 2008 dating of the year and written communication from the Wilkins ambassadors agreed to Washington from the increasingly negative hard-line image, the dramatic series broadcast on development, spread by the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even Abführungen for the purpose of interrogation analysis by the CIA Muskelprotze watch.
Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked on their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner, during their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is ready to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner is expected to answer the question yes, but on the basis of an individual " case to Fall"-Entscheidung.
Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, "he was the Secretary of State distributed a paper on the issue of Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslim Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised the files again."
Finally, we can still see the sensibilities on the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close Stephen Harper standing adviser, explained on development, that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed."
He was here to just cites Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN has a plan yesterday in Cancún for the renewal of the lighting from households, commerce and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases (CFCs) proposed nearly a third of the additional reduction is in line with that must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of specific projects, a UN in Cancun hopes to implement by the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries.
After the yesterday put forward a plan that would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs emitted as a result of the lighting on the planet to be avoided, if the white hot pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market by fluoreszierend or, better still, by diodes (LED) would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This equates to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year had the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, was committed to a voluntary Reduktionsplänen, the global fckw emissions from 53 to 49 Gt downsized Gt should.
From this record, we should still deduct 5 Gt from now until the year 2020 climate rises at 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise in order to avoid that this control.
In the white hot pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% to produce the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, reduced with the new LED bulbs this energy again twice.
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold on average between 6 000 to 10 000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those which the manufacturer Philips has brought this week on the market - this society has participated in the study undertaken - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which auswechselung plan gives a hint of the savings, which is supposed to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese novel light bulbs only make very little heat, they can also work with a set widerstand.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves to run because they mercury and that they therefore must as a toxic waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except which producers constitute a Bring Centre available.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury, the electricity is being wasted by the White fiery oranges to produce.
Alone in the United States encounter these coal plants 25 000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would such a billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 is saved, which means an equivalent of 3.5 Kohlekraftwerken, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits heated the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election in the Ivory Coast called directly for their deadline.

But the gbagbo camp reckons with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Court by the Ex-Rebellenlager of the Forces nouvelles (group) during the abortive coup in September 2002 have been achieved.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiced by the group on the intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the president to go to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo will be considered by the Constitutional Court.
However, the Gbagbo-Kontrahenten are now more of the view that the country's high court is not neutral, since he Paul Yao N'Dré, a political ties led by Laurent Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, which denies any link to the Ex-Rebells, the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" assessed and Gbagbo asked to respect them, even if he is not gone so far as to claim the victory.
His Bündnisparter confirm Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost; and a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after the electoral commission had disqualified to publish the results, seie illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were held by a country for the coronation of the association and reconciliation process over several years was divided into two parts.

You describe how the Elysée Americans had declared its strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers).

In truth, he had not done anything in this regard.
One in Paris on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomatic telegram of condolences bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking."
François Richier, the Elysée adviser in strategic issue, kept in the accompaniment of Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her the French method.
The Americans urged to do everything possible to make their own nationals back to bring the violent in Iran would be recorded.
"Power noise," she said, "loud and clear, articulate and endlessly," the words ' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence ,"" immediate release " in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which respects very sensitive to his image.
"Betreibt all the more so, especially if you ask the Iranians not to do."
The fact is that "silence solves nothing" over the discussion experiments on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in prevarication."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners a ' normal, Iranian tactic: "Kidnapping for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day on which she takes refuge in French embassy) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230 000 million).
And it can be reported, the display antizipiere more hostage-taking, a phenomenon which "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1 800 French nationals living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss 12 days ago has been released from prison, but will continue to be detained in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States because of illegal trade in sensitive electronics materials to Iran, demand after ruling by a judge in Paris has been released from prison.
The US Embassy is like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks followed the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program is a bad news for the release of Majid Khakavand.
France has taken a horse-trading in purchase?
The liberation of the Iranians against the logic of the French?
During another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The display, as he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judges," but also tried to resist.
"It was a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French justice minister given" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government could not change the judicial decision," he says.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service says.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the buildings, led by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
While in the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the display does not save his efforts, through statements and by the media of organized "flight testing" believe Syrian President Bachar al Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediation."
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram datierendes on 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities."
What is based so much "thanks" towards Mr. Assad, wonders the Paris embassy.
"Despite their declarations, full of Lobpreis, the French authorities privately admit that they only have a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then addresses the reasons which led to the Elysée to plumb this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A 2008 launched policies, then "many critical votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved perceptions."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" testing Paris "Syria to remember which laud it can achieve by it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August Francois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever they have done."
"But we have nevertheless thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010 back.
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the display.
In a statement he would like to thank the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is a law, known as the "Cinderella" pass, which will not allow the young people to play Online-Games after midnight, by giving them access, as government leaders.
A draft of the online spiele operators should appeal to young people under 16 years after midnight to deny access to these Games, will be presented to Parliament in December, schilderten representatives of Education and Familienministerien.
"Many children play this Games the whole night and then have difficulty with learning in the school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary for their health and to ensure their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Customs officers charged with this bill, the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The Online-Games were then again available from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturing companies had a year for a long time to prepare for the application of the law, as he clarified.
The government fasser just in the eye, to ask the manufacturer, the daily time limit provided for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask that the responsible person added.
He will be just as those people who want free programs available that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "interdependent" countries, and newspapers on a regular basis by various events associated with intense Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in global Online-Game-Wettbewerben.
South Korea had in November, compared with 58 other nations with four gold medal won in the World Cyber Games.
2018 2022 World Cup: the FIFA appoints the ausrichter country
In a chaotic frenzy because of corruption suspicions appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday, the ausrichter countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the Rangeln influence and lobbying the technical criteria are threatening to push into the background.
But one thing is certain: the spending 2018 the royal discipline of FIFA in Europe, its traditional stronghold, take place (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, between belgien).
The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes for the first time on the African continent in the year 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue.
The list of personalities on the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the extent of the economic and political use of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening up to the last minute to hold.
Otherwise it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, the English, Spanish portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than those of its competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees on the hour of choice is not so strong.
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, also had a good chance for their own country, cradle of the football, can ruin, only a single time was allowed to compete at the World Cup: 1966.
The BBC had the ground again on Monday given by their own report was broadcast, the three influential members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou takes under fire.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass primarily with David Cameron had pursued an intense lobbying in recent weeks.
The Government hopes for a repeat of the gambit fine from his predecessor Tony Blair in London in 2005 had reached the organization of the Olympic Games in 2012.
The dignity of this intensive use enough image England appearance before the Kommitee again?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain Portugal has no shortage of trump cards, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games in 1992 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial drawbacks of the two countries could stifle their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the influential outsiders are rising.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to openly hint at the Bezichtigungs of the English press "an unfair competition in the runup to the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder denounced.
"We bewirft it with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin lashed out.
For 2022 seem the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites.
First economic superpower, seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very nice project separately.
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries that had helped host the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the long-awaited approval of the FIFA World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities will lapse in 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadium had drawn all registers, the FIFA has pursued her expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk for certainty.
Australia may as well as Japan and South Korea under the akquittierten weakness of the European countries of television rights (due to the time shift) have to suffer the delicate nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle had genuinely curtailed.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy, still less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next.
The current leader will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is the side of the mystery of the presidential function, not a good thing to face.
So we must act as if there would be doubts now.
In one, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac's pretended that a third mandate is not excluded, without even believing.
On 15 November in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that its decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011" to be taken.
The fact that he on Tuesday evening in the display of UMP-Parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would, therefore, had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president left just remind you that the change in the constitution of 2008, the number of five years of consecutive terms to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election, made during these meetings mentioned in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you are still seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
In a new state in May 2010: "Does not, that I do not think beyond the stage."
His words of the day does not make him more about the candidate than the day before; but it is also not less.
If they alarmist comment, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes for the nomination with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to reveal.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS early as adopted for the Challenge.
The poor polls on the other side.
For the first time, the electorate would be the rights of François Fillon a candidacy by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the survey of BVA-L'Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP ', and immediately reacted cautiously to the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If it is a defeat would find as possible, he would not be a candidate" shares Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe it to be able to win" corrected Alain Juppé, who has gone along with the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain their buying of government securities
The final assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB in the past year should provide an opportunity to explore ways to show how it can emerge from the crisis, or at least the layout of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy, will announce the end of the year will come to its conclusion.
The crisis in the European sovereign debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can afford without any doubt, even today, more than tense situation in the European bond markets ambitions, not the cause.
The political cost would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference by the European Central Bank adopted an active role in favour of the resolution welcomes the state budget deficits in Europe.
It has not dared to say whether they thought the central bank could do even more, for example, by reviving its program of buying government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank had the day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very articulate about his project demonstrated, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market "to continue to be operated" would be and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "will see how the decisions will emerge."
The only certainty: the ECB is its key interest rate untouched at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases were the treasure chamber of the European Central Bank last week to about 1,35 billion has doubled.
And according to leaks by some traders to yesterday's new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 made purchases totalling 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers is the anticipation of a follow-up of the Kaufkurses not in any way in doubt (see page 29).
Already, the economists do not expect any notable change more.
If the Anleihengeschäfte of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter still in the full Geldmittelreserven to create freigiebige type, and over a period of a week of up to three months.
The economists are already taken today that this measure will extend even for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on fundamental way."
"Otherwise they would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," as alleged, Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011, progressive exit seems likely," for its part, anticipates, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the market for sovereign debt, "the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds to maintain that stimulates the sluggish market," Mr. Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks in the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the Central Bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market.
"At any price, you must come to the Steller of the lack of investors in the market and so to act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the paid returns to the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday, an important bond holders.
The fact is that if interest rates start to the exuberance, the states would be prevented from doing more to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The government of Berlusconi in Italy in coverage
After a disturbing week beginning in Italy the situation yesterday, with the decline of the Eckzinsen for 10 years a little more relaxed.
A return to the uneasy silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regional chairman, Giulio Tremonti, to the situation as a "unentzifferbar" train and it with an "unpredictable" weekend can expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday at least had the gap with the German interest rates its record of 210 base points achieved and the price of contracts to cover the Konkursrisikos are risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain amount of Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi was in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in Spain to the German interest rates is in the hands of 400 base points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as a "serious concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland indicated.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
To put it plainly, his problem is the shortage of economic growth and the concomitant anaemic tax eingangs the state in danger, no longer cover its funding needs to be able to.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future will be an Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and expects 1,4% in the year 2012... even though the current budget in the Senate for consideration with 1,3% respectively, 2% of the expected.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the European Commission, the budget deficit next year will be 4,3% of GDP (contrary to the government's forecast 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Hence the uproar about a new budgetary collective after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy in order and its accounts are settled, we repeat this for a very long time," Arrigo Sadun assured Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither short-term nor long-term point of view, because of Italy, despite its high level of debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.), lesser Stabilisationsfortschritte will be required as of other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief volkswirt of the OECD.
That leaves the question of political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi is a motion of censure in the House of Representatives face as a result of those early elections at the end of March could be organized.
It is therefore a little favorable period before a decisionmaking process on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of the anti-crisis measures to
Christine Lagarde was still yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris underlined: "I think it has to go on Sunday afternoon and also shown on the evening: the Europeans think clearly, together, are willing and committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone."
Although entirely relative - yesterday recorded withdrawal in the Zinsfüßen of European government bonds was water on the mills of the governments and the European Central Bank.
But from a normalisation start may not yet be the speech.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could be the debt of Portugal, which is probably most effective target for speculators today, lower.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which particularly affect the banking systems," so the view of economists Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, given that "the political time is moving much more slowly than those of the markets."
The European countries both this gap, as well as the risk that it finds are well aware, intensify the discussions on the strengthening of the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most closely affected financial ministers and in the wider sense with their counterparts in the G20 is progressing well.
And this is also in relation to the meetings of euro groupe and the Ecofin Council at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is today.
The plan says the fate of unconventional measures on the backing of the countries of the euro zone in the risk of markets (see below).
As regards the EU's Stability Fund, as its executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in Singapour started his Asian tour, the investors in the Far East has to be informed of the developments with regard to the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit, although not expressly overrunning, as he prepares for this certainly the terrain.
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU's Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday an official US representative of Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase of the additional, direct involvement of the IMF mobilized funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first set, sending itself to structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour organisation.
Reforms, which added to the austerity measures, but its effects are expected to show in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than that Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other at any price is to avoid asking for international assistance to have before they set their own Budgetkorrektive and have decided on unavoidable structural reforms, which give them the confidence brings on a permanent basis.
The European investors, in turn, maintain about the available options in order to speed up the normalization process of the markets of bonds.
Axel Weber, who is in transit in Paris on 24 November, Chen had first brought the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billions of euros were not enough, so the Union would not hesitate to resort again in their own pockets.
The economists from Barclays Capital, in terms of the market entirely in the forefront of European government debt standing player, judging by an extension of the 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding exists: the European mechanism being financial stabilization, which is currently 60 billion.
An advisory committee, which has all chances, closely in European capitals to be studied.
Above all, if market conditions worsen.
Snow and black ice: 24 departments in alert orange
The Schnee-Episoden still draw after Verkehrsschwierigkeiten, especially in the secondary road network of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alert orange because of the threat of snow and Glatteisrisikos.
The regions ," Eure-et-Loir, deux sèvres and were already on alert Orange 20 departments have been added; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, affect the intense snow schauer the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it is snowing slightly on the Ile de France.
In the affected departments are snow cover from 2 to 5 inches in places also expected from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 inches, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
It affects the regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, coasts of d'Armor Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Lower Normandy, Ile de France and Limousin regions.
The snow is remarkable enough Verkehrsbehinderungen to cause and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
Coasts of d'Armor in the region are several Regionalstrassen for the heavy traffic of about 7.5 tonnes blocked, including the routes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation in the secondary road network in Brittany, according to the traffic policemen who advise against the use of his own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, very difficult, and the use of some TER-Reisebusse the whole day was about to be deleted.
In the Picardy school transport was lifted on Thursday.
For the heavy traffic were on Wednesday night provided no specific restrictive measures.
The police "on the streets urging motorists to exercise the utmost caution, as well as to adapt their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for civil aviation (DGAC) urged the airlines on Thursday 25% of their from Roissy airport and 10% of the Orly launch of next shuttle flights as a result of the expected to remove heavy snow.
The DGAB recommends the passenger to contact their airline.
The airports Gatwick south of London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial spectacular
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry is in full swing on the Ile de France, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
We urge in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built.
In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP in the ways that the state has a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical system, this is the amount, which would then allow the SGP to the markets to their two times to give a part of the finance bill.
Today, it is, after all, come to first projections.
The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning seen by the financial committee of the National Assembly, contains measures intended to raise the first part of this money.
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax on the Erschließund and a higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, we remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public clinic Société du Grand Paris."
This is the equivalent: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Two more, an overhaul of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise them, in order to increase their resulting product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris to respond."
How much would this bring?
It is a mystery.
This amount is not quantified in the text.
From the 4 billion is far away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros will be added to the capital dotation, which can be found by the state and the Société du Grand Paris after and to be done for the project," as is apparent from the explanatory presentation.
In the case of the SGP, does not mean this system at all.
"Since the moment in which revenue (the two taxes that R.), you can cover long studies over three years and then extract from the 4 billion," so declared.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimated that it will be launched in 2013, the 4 billion to make a note on the budget in 2014.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions of people will be able to search for a long time, runs the risk that a law is on the move, causing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December instead.
Rachsüchtige hackers and industrious spies
The Affaire has a dual significance.
On one side, she was emerging as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between the countries, ruled the public and the press.
On the other hand, it presents profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by recession.
But we are taking the series.
The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act drawn up by a secret service (a nation) composed solely of newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary" that American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw no more than what you for months on anyway in any Journal got to read (except those whose owners Berlusconi) and the terrifying karikaturierte offered Kabarettkünstlern already rebuffed profile stuff for a long time for their Sketchs.
The rule, according to which the secret files should only consist of well-known news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library devoted to the esotherischen publications, you will see that every piece of work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer or Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written in previous works.
It is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts intends to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he did not knew where to find would be news to report on the non existierende), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and confirmed what they already have learned.
This is also the most mechanism of Dan Brown.
Similarly, the secret files.
The informant is rotten and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (he might otherwise whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), which only considers to be true, which he acknowledges.
The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, the US Embassy in Rome was sent to the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those which Newsweek had previously published the week.
So why such a fuss was made by the revelations of these files?
On one side they say what any educated person knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the leaders can call each other, or we can take a plane in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small classed have turned spy centres.
Every and any viewer of investigative movies knows this very closely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that it is doing so to ignore this.
However: the fact that to repeat it in public, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: the idea that an ordinary hacker secret most secrets can become the most powerful country in the world, carries a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
The scandal also brings fewer victims, rather than the "executioner" in trouble.
But we address the profound nature what happened.
Ehemals Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother to combine the controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy had since then as a perfectly correct can turn out when you can, thanks to the telephone control every movement, every site's operation, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so forth; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power.
But if you are in mind, what is happening today that even the secret Kryptas of power will not be able to escape the control of a Hackers, listens as the monitoring of the elections to be addressed, unilaterally and zirkelförmig.
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as the public - can discover the secrets of power.
How can they keep a grip on power, which is no longer able to protect their own secrets?
It is true, Mr. Simmel said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconi's or Merkel's essentially free of Geheimis is a mystery, because the public sphere of price; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were means to deprive them of any power.
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, however, Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused such an enormous power?
It is obvious that the states in future no reserved information will make more online - that would be tantamount to a posting added on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is frustrated with the current technology to hope confidential reports to be able to keep secret via telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane move and one of his colleagues contacted.
How could future private and only for certain ears certain relationships?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roma confinement sounds, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents in a secret manner inspired to uncontrollable road routes moving their messages anywhere else than in a mere memory key, and also the few written information they received in the shoe marketing verbergend.
Only copy the information would be stored in locked drawers: basically had the spy effort of Watergate less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telecommunications had revolutionized communications, the Internet is a Telegrafen (telephone) line.
The (analog) Videokassetten had allowed the Filmforschern ribbon band for a film auszukundschaften by one spulen from the back forward and was able to reveal all of the secrets of the Montags, whereas the (digital) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words, Makroportionen.
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications technology come back on car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets have been forged between the messages.
At the moment, there are the messages, which demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France is talking about his financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to observe the fast gelösten funding pledges (including "Fast Start" or premature funding mentioned) to investigate were carried out by the developing countries.
And already the rough French vulnerable to blandishments revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 will be set aside.
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all register their partners from the fact of their commitment to convince the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: accurate course report of its Member States, press conference, large side events broschüre distribution.
The operation of transparency is remarkable and appreciated for their real value: the developing countries and civil society would look like if all developed countries the same made at the same level.
The EU announced, 2.2 billion euros in 2010 to have released what they on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 Dollar billion in 2012 will bring.
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced without the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best.
The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for the person of the Year 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and in the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years of 150 million.
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid will be elected.
In contrast, France has been of the opinion that the financing "of all the new projects," the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words: there is no guideline in the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the report said the total amount of French aid can remain stable in the developing countries (or even diminish) - France is its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" financing must be respected.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and each elects its calculation method.
Some, such as France, for example, 1 borrowed as equivalent to 1 donated.
This is obviously difficult reasonable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often projects tied to emission mitigation, which are based on effektivster technology) can be justified, it is wrong to portray the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... let only the cost of loans for capital donor country to be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following thought: it "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans (389,8 million) for the negotiation and 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see also the EU documents in order to convince themselves.
France is the only EU country that loans in large measure on its territory.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) with their obligations to 100% to follow up with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 spends to fulfil their commitments, France just 10 cents and meant a similar commitment.
Schöner!
Everything is operating in all of France in his fast start with a double rip-off: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France will be able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million has been spent in accordance with its promises, it will save 36,1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it would appear that Bercy was carried out of the arbitrage) a double negative impact could entail; even internally (why continue with donations from other member states if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries do not completely fooled...
The chapter of the premature funding only a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
As it always is, it is essential to its lesson from this first year to learn verfrühter funding.
First, France could be a change in his Verbuchungsart parade for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France could be the discussions on the contentious subject of long-term financing forward (another crucial and current topic): you can escape the issue of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the Verbuchungsart of its loans are not.
France could change its position, as advanced in terms of controversy, as it is in other things.
The hope is the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast starts of France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit," as well as the use of loans would increase by nature of the international trust needed for further discussions.
Warning - pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years takes on the day an 81 different chemicals, so a this Wednesday of the unification Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of future generations) published study.
The association, which says that its results "given the small number of analyzed samples no statistically significant value to restore, but illustration character of the treated problems pose" was between July and September, usually within four of a nearly 10-year-old child to the meals consumed food plus an interim mahlzeit in the supermarket bought in Oise and Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit share three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, as well as biscuits from laboratories in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants studied.
The balance is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic classified and five klassifizierte as a safe karziogen, as well as 37 other substances with Endokrinin-Störfaktor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the nearly the whole range of cases the legal limits for any chemical, individual ingested substance not be crossed, so we remove this collection but very well that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances will be suspended with Endokrinin-Störfaktor concern," the association noted.
On the breakfast included only the butter and tea with milk is already more than 10 of the potentially cancerous changes that those responsible for delays and three safe as carcinogenic proven, as well as more than 20 residues, which may affect the hormonal system.
The apples imported from Brazil, planned for the study as an interim mahlzeit, traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, including in the lunch, where the study found traces of a banned insecticide strictly in the EU has found.
In addition, the Hacksteak tuna, even the Baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
The senior water analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform brought to light.
At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues on the "richest," and even for putting the meal in the microwave used plastic party was not free.
The eventual risk of this "Schadstoffcocktails" for the consumer "is probably undervalued," so the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation," to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, "increase in the number of Western diseases" to stop.
In July a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding the presence of residues 365 various pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables that have been identified, consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
