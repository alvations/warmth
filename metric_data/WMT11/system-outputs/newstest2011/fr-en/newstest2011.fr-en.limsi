That is what will happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD to the mayoralty of the capital will apparently overcome real language barrier to understand the local council with their old and new colleagues in the ODS.
The daily Actualne.CZ has "tested" the new members of the council owned CSSD, whether they know the argôt who was born in recent years at the city hall, when it was the coalition partners present who ran in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that cream policy of Prague initiated during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known words.
At least they say.
"That is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a jeunôt in the pragoise policy has responded Lukas Kaucky, elected to the culture to the test of the" godfather " of vocabulary.
And as regards the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression among those that you propose that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Vocabulary, including the daily Aktualne.CZ published expressions in June this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, drafting chose 6 examples, particularly those associated with the town hall of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf hole in Prague," go to the patisserie, " " sinews of beef, " " betrayal of the capital " and " entôler ."
Three of the elected representatives have agreed to quiz the fourth - Weinert, which must lead education in Prague in the future - initially promised an interview but then not won the telephone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has flatly refused the test.
"I don't any of these things and how much fun the representatives of civic democracy: I shall not give my opinion."
"I am currently working the way we are going to understand in the context of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not recognize apparently in the legend above, it is the Janousek affect contractors and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" said nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky and adds: "But I know the newspapers."
"I will have to pay me a language courses," jokes he explains.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but Lukas Plachy, elected to the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - we believe in the meaning of "go to the pastry."
"This is, I think, to go into a business," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of Janousek companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather newspapers and not from any vocabulary that he would use.
According to the candidates to tests there is no argôt lexicon in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we have really not something of this type."
"It is quite the names sometimes using abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, that Party members call Hulda.
"I called Briza to school but I don't know if I call as says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily actual.CZ tested the name and it ain't.
The elected Weinert is Poppy for members of the Party or even the least friendly Petit old, the Representative Miroslav Boisvert, who drew attention to him before the elections by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "little joujou."
The nicknames are also the only admit employ inside the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky do not care to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.CZ recorded another nickname for this president Prague.
"Doctor in law with batons" recalls it seems that Petr Hulinsky received his doctorate in law JUDr. At the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce torture "witches," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women reported witch have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, may not work for example for reasons of health, are free and have no children.
That becomes "witch" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely this fate."
"We do not judge young women in good health as they participate in the work and give birth children," said a sister who cares in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this "social measure" unusual.
He has published a brochure which should help limit the witch hunt.
The case involves a "trick."
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso does not read," warned the daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72 year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they doused.
It is the server of the BBC which has forwarded this information.
Criminals say that it was bad.
According to their version oil which is used for ceremonial tasks is emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, it seems, when the team has tried to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the witch hunt, The Gambia not later than last year has even seen the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch-hunt which, it appears, would have been involved in his death and would be tried by the black magic to kill also President."
"Shamans of Guinea near come to the rescue, led to the strong presidential Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of President, men and women randomly selected dansdes villages in Gambia," said in a message the organization " Amnesty International.
On-farm those imprisoned had to drink a herbal potion hallucinogenic effects which caused more other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
On the international pressure is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: the poèles heat, he signed a higher rent.
A 27-year-old imposing came through the door of the centre of the company's clientele PGR Byty "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He was wearing under the arm a record with three new lease contracts for three apartments: hers, that of his daughter and his son who is spirited to serve a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent in these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 son faces from next year for an apartment 2 + 1 second class 4,100 kroons.
"And there was no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract for her son the man who has the authority to sign.
"But I signed anyway," explains motié angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD apartments.CZ who described the nouelles rental terms such as "immoral and obscene," advises tenants don't sign and wait until 7 December, by which date will be issued a notice to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One said, the other says something else" in the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, it is expected that most of the apartment in the Czech Republic, which rents do not reflect the market price.
Aktualne.CZ has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory."
The waiting room of GARs street Havirovska is one of four of the Ostrava region and it is already full Tuesday at 09:00 in the morning.
Right beside the door stands a guard for a security company with a device to call clients.
A special button, "rent 2011," was lit on the touch-screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number fate of the device.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to brighten up on the big screen in the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to relate to people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - calls for repairs, events on insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, the people of more than 44,000 apartments portfolio of GARs receive letters with the new lease agreements in their mailbox since around mid-November.
PGR Byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for the new rent is open to the public since 18 November.
"It works for almost a week, it is still in the trial" addresses, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the wicket when the client is presented as a journalist.
The déragulation and the old flats of minor Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The Vice-President of the parliament and from the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported quite steady before the elections and this Bosniak local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even changed could.... N plate in the wc, relieves introduction man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, pensioners who have come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised PGR in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half of the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires who have signed a new contract before 15 December.
But the window "deregulation" street Havirovaska is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," says the employee at the wicket.
And yet GARs proposed both on its website that in the showcases individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties disagree on the rent is an independent tribunal which will take the decision.
"It's not threats but only to inform on the sole and legitimate way to act legally," says GARs on its website.
"Here nobody will go to the court" believes one of Byty GARs employed and the man in the street before the centre of clients with him.
"I have 13,000 kroner retirement and remaining 5,000 kroner to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr Zaoralek media request that nobody sign and therefore people are waiting," says she.
The regulation of rents ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to PGR Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still below the level necessary for simple maintenance of funds for housing," recalled Pavel Klimes, director of residential portfolio of GARs Byty society, that it is precisely the neglect of the fund for housing which makes the tenant anger is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 GARs has been with rents invest in apartments 4 billion in four years from 2011 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hooked up to the ceiling in front of upholstered chairs of the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, however, repeat some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15% and not less than 31200 apartments over 90% of the apartments of GARs."
"And this will always be more 7.5 CZK m² per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38% only 400 apartments portfolio of GARs.
"In those instances, there is an increase of a sum really very low 19.66 CZK m²," adds GARs.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
PGR Byty promised that deregulation will not cause a gradual but radical increase on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money for rent increases (see the graph) is rendered the apartments in the form of heating economies - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increases have priority.
The kindergarten, too, is part of the offices have understood the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
Nobody could have expected that it also houses a mini nursery school with whatever it takes - walls of colours, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a playground miniature on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can get to the children of employees of Arch. Design.
The company projects - architectural Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, devised her mini nursery business since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly age to make children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time that contracts of work time decreased, nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by society Arch. Design. as part of its social agenda.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a job taking care for children.
These are the employees of Arch. Design. themselves who dreamed up this kindergarten and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain an allocation of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded by means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (EUR 2.8 mil. CZK). They were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure a qualified personnel as well as the implementation.
After the use of the allocation of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. the obligation after 3 years of operating the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is society Economy rating that has helped to make the staffing request.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, the entire day a nurse and a schoolteacher mother caring for children. Children can go to school with no age limit, but they have more than three anspour most.
As a "mini nursery school" can there be than 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who will replace.
The operation of the school is flexible depending on the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although agise an individual care and education, the programme of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children don't play, but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation of school benches are taught English.
The classroom is equipped not only of toys and games imaginative but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a positive and friendly environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not having the stress of a delay to pick up their children in a remote school workplace parents.
Parents use their time to work on the most productive way.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between employee and employer.
Arch. Design so is among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The house in bone fascinates even after 100 years. Throw an eye in the domestic Gaudi.
The children17 is similar to the back of a prehistoric saurien, staircase to a spine dinosaur and balconies of open fish.
It was the home Casa Battlo Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received bone from the premises the nickname House.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, tiles and mosaîque fragments, facade recalling scales and all curves, that is all that is ypique for Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house taking place its lines of dream, its colours and textures enjoyable reminiscent nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation pictured geometry, the pace and sequencing thought with precision.
On the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brilliance of colour is strengthened.
The furling and the twisting form is also reflected in the interiors with the same degree.
Wood copy in waves of window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, the oeilleton and slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample neighbourhood in the street market terms of concept at number 43, was born of the construction of a house in 1877 architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was done for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as multi-unit house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol was working with him.
It is precisely on its project that are born decorations for an apartment in representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the facade have also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo began with a cooperation $9,542,000 between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Casa Mila Gaudi and Park Guell in which there are other Gaudi works.
The premises have dubbed the hot house just after the finish because of its "Maison bone" organic forms.
Others, having regard to the specific mechanism to open windows have called "the house drink."
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George's the boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi was thought to house a single system in its time of central heating, with aeration vents and chimneys characteristic.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the Gaudi establishment has not complied with the directives of construction and has not been hindering by them.
At the start of construction he obtained city permits, knowing, of course, that the data brought on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after finishing the town council was appalled and demanded changes.
He did not like, for example, the members of the council that the pillars of the construction empiettent public on the sidewalk.
He never did change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep Battlo demanded (and obtained satisfaction) approval to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery third-floor there was a common and the third a private room and a portion of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelery.
The entire house of six floors is shared by a staircase that leads up to an independent children17 terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi worked also the modern concept of liaison spaces.
The joint portion can be linked completely by opening the doors of the fairs and high society can communicate comfortably or well limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received new facades a non-traditional toîture and two more storeys.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, glazed blue and white tiles with which is decorated the interior courtyard and with the wells of lights.
The game at two colors gives a maximum of light on all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Battlo home that has been recorded in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund of UNESCO may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the largest and most splendid apartment accessible to the public.
Owners have decided to cross this not in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they have found that it is a lucrative business, and they have broadened the scope of visits to the common spaces and attic including the terraces of children17.
The ticket in the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, the groups and tourism cardholders have 20% discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house, with its turrets fantastic, you have to quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress support: women have other criteria than men.
Not ostentatious, but rather the quality of the space at bedtime, so the mattress and the mattress support provide a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course be harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the several things are decisive choice: weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the mattress support is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the cottage where you don't sleep continually latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm" softly.
Moreover, they have a higher weight to polyurethane mattresses standards.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough also ventilation channels in the heart and, in addition, if they remain on a solid plate, they also trap moisture. Mould may also form.
The habit is also a decisive factor in the choice.
The person who spends the clear time abroad where frequently mattresses very thick with a rammollissante layer, difficult to feel naturally low and hard surface.
"It is as well as all hokeyistes who are returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and coasts, they need mattresses with a rammollisante layer of foam lazy."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, which therefore assume wrong" information "joints and the skin," said Adamczikova Sylva who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why there are a few years the mattress with foam lazy conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Today everything works, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico was an example of appropriate mattress.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL to assess a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It maximizes its rigidity and its form by the heat absorbed or well adapts to the warmth of your body.
Nothing is putting pressure on you and you don't go back into the night like after a difficult match.
You simply sleep better.
The foam lazy can also function as a protection against the esquarres.
The choice of the mattress in terms of your size, add the length of the feet, or approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two seats should be 90 cm by 180 cm.
For beds in a single place, the singles', for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient to visit.
"However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should ask the hands of comfortable with elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers - matelassiers and designers dedicated to the issue of healthy sleep for several years and ergonomics furniture and taught in specialist schools.
For a bed to two seats each needs its own mattress support and mattresses, so attention however during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only continue to climb the mattress support at different heights and it is not feasible in all settings bed.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattress springs at least 15 cm, that you can count on the subgrade and aeration at least three centimetres.
"Touching or sitting on the mattress you do not feel the springs," cautions Héléna Prokopova.
Every mattress request a specific type of mattress support.
The bed -- mattress support when the mattress and the mattress support are united as sisters, had nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress is aèrent very bad; we must not wash, which is commonly auhourd' hui.
And since overnight it exudes normally 0.2 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to recall a great (and closed) sieve.
For this the specialists refuse to advertise on a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But his but.
And for this a council of experience of the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140 cm, dispensing, for the lining of the mattress, hygiene or washing but add quite a mattress that you may easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to produce coatings with zipper for all together, which means that after the opening was two parts (for washing and the size of a washing machine is very important!) if not manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when you cut off a battle between a lightweight and a lorry on a ring.
You in your bed a rigid plate instead of a mattress support?
Never!
The maximum for a bed visitors' for only one night.
However Wainwright's rodeo plate (if there is not a) aeration holes and use the mattress springs with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in pouches (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For box slats to single position with roles slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal, but this will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the bottom part of the kidney and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress at several positions should not be taken mattress springs because it does not respond to the changes of position.
Alongside the setting of the rigidity of slats can also install the so-called cradle shoulder.
It is a special liaison slats that allows pressure or even tilt the parasitic protozoan that the shoulder of the Dungeness "fits."
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by manufacturers of mattresses for the "male" have begun to use a rammollissante zone at the level of the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer new surface softest level hips.
For the most difficult customer there are box wings or platelets with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure is spreading in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and mattress support, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is simple pillow; the pillow should support the head and its peaks must reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles to relax.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm and the Scandinavians for example prefer.
When one is lying on the side, the pillow should upgrade (with the cradle of the mattress support shoulder or rammollie area under the mattress) shoulder height.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first base of straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or even mixtures.
The trend is also the organic mattress.
The raw materials base of pétrôle, from which it manufactures polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use precisely soybeans.
"The qualifier Bio mattress means that the heart is manufactured using natural products," said Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are used also for coating mattresses; one of the first has been enlightening.
But you can add micro capsules that develop perfumes forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants for the mattress coating absorbs heat and chill the body, "cools" man, coatings "burn" women.
The red pepper extract accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore warmer for sex low.
The current favourite?
Mats made from foam cold (it has more pores with a cell structure disturbed therefore more respirante than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities cold foams gives mattress polyzones who know exactly where the head, the lower back and feet.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 kroner and more.
Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Save for the mattress and the mattress support is not simple.
It may in time be within the framework of special action on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Such as the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattress with foam memory Memory beneath the coating to 11990 kronor.
We can obviously take the second free.
The era of mosses lazy or with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the field Tempur "cosmic" at a pace.
It started as matters for NASA parceque astronauts suffered at the start of the huge load factors.
The Tempur rammollit in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It adapts perfectly warm human body and distributes an optimum pressure.
It is for this ideal against slept well and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Mosses are used not only for the mattress but also for the health products, such as special pillows for the feet that alleviate the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type.
The devices to track people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their children brings more and more people to think monitor through a GPS.
The system, implemented early to seek out the cars may well be used to chart the movement of people and help for some cases such as for example that of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to confuse their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not a spy but merely another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the firm Weil MAcro who is one of the suppliers of tracing devices on the Czech market.
"I must admit that there are cases of misuse of such devices, such as put in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I haven't met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for reasons of security," adds Pilin.
He said children should always know what is being used "the box" and how to use it in emergencies.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child does not want to focus on something of this kind, it is débarassera.
"And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to dispose express something when they do not want to be under control."
"Cell phones, which can cut as these devices tracing, have already prompted parents to long waits," said Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of aircraft to assist in case of aggression is highly debatable.
"If it's a whaler prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as will develop tracing devices, they (the criminals) will also seek the because the sale will be backed by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals are always ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She confesses that even that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech society RCA Monitoring, which offers both for cars and for people tracing services, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be paramétré in such a way that it is issuing regular after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains even the latest position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices were also a inclinomètre who shall immediately report the position of the person who has slipped and is found in lie motionless," says Cech.
He said the so-called intelligent mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after the formatted with a special prologiciel.
The problem of tracing systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn by pendant the size of a box of matches to smaller telephone equipment.
You can always lose.
According to Pilina company Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"It will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not recognize the tracing device."
"Either he will after a certain time, which has given the police a little more time," he adds.
The tracking device developed either in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it utilisiera always the same technology to draw cars.
It's a combination of systems acquisition of a position by GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a mobile phone to alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cord that she could do the turn of the Czech Republic with; but it can take two years.
The army has bought for 445 kilometers of cordeaux used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 kilometers.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years ago.
The problem is that the life of the cordeaux is two to four years.
The army has bought detonating cord to the company STV Group for 40 million kronor.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the achât at MF Dnes a huge quantity of detonating cord that soldiers use 60 kilometers per year.
According to the calculations of reserve to hold made by the army Pyrotechnicians, MF Dnes contacted, it is clear that even the generals, the officers who command, secretaries or even the personal household should have a year to explosives each year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister for Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are not exceptions.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 kilometers of detonating cord.
At this distance corresponds 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reserves of the army could meet them for 10 years.
If it is true that for basic training of each new professionals it is enough to more than 2 m of detonating cord, as experts, this means that the army with its new purchase assured - with also the use of special units and engineering - reserves for 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to the Minister Vondra they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and the shooting sessions are limited because of money needs.
About the lack of linen body it is not.
"And I do not take the lead if they buy if much home of detonating cord."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"For us the army is a good customer we strive as traders make do," said the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argues the achât of hundreds of kilometers of detonating cord by the fact that the army will be the "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports of only four years of lifespan of detonating cord and the police and army Pyrotechnicians only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it may even go up to four years," said one who does not want his name published due to the criticism of the army.
The deadline for lifetime past, each item must be tested to see if it remains integrates and does not threaten the life of a soldier.
These tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the amount to 445 kilometers of detonating cordeux.
"We have cost 60 percent less than the provision of last year's 245 kilometers," says Pejsek spokesman who is interpreter of the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cord Pyrotechnicians police that neutralize the munitions from the Second World War or even after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 metres.
And the police still commands only the required amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
It has been established for reasons of security Pyrotechnicians and to be able to get more flexible types of detonating cord more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence today has big problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, course on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this army Czech FM Dnes contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cord that she now buys "cheap."
Until today I benefit from contacts that I have achieved through competition.
The sale under franchise to his hotel well helped Lukas Pytloun to the place of winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual Entrepreneur for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, contractor for 28 years.
His adventure toward the success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that he lacked Libérec a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
His savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small 5 apartment building half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of graduate school, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting a first apartment reconstructed to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since then, entrepreneurial action allowed him to open up to 4 Libérec pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds for all categories of accommodation.
The more comfortable among them was until recently the four-star Pytloun hotel design.
This year it came another par.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova u Tise where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates for the franchise Pytloun hotels have shown," the number 1 entrepreneurs in the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a hotel at large scale has served to contest the victory of the entrepreneur of the year, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory gave it more popular and be known to Libérec and its environs.
"People I recognized in the streets, I often contentedly and, I must say, that it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
This is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said that it uses up to now his contacts and knowledge that he would not have been able to obtain any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain regular trade relations.
According to him, the notoriety linked to success has also had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I observed among them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that was generally recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job for us all together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the purpose of the Farmet winner has the worst moments behind.
Those who came to fetch the price to Slovansky dum for first place in the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which he has transformed a workshop equipment to Ceska Skalice in a firm turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only my also my collaborators and has increased our self-confidence to combat competition," said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent a small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, was denied a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a company with a few comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic tubs.
Not very long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
He became after 18 years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has been known to the public even nonspecialist after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to really know better the Farmet mark, but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were collaborating with a company that received the greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year e not went to Farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company had been made from the economic results for 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
Top of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technology.
"We have not escaped obviously in this situation."
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we were limiting our production and even dismiss," said Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society should know that from time to time we have to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation properly and have retained clients results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However Farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with endowments, have enhanced the presentation of the society in salons - international exhibitions and won the top awards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything leads us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
Affires figures date back and the number of employees also with them.
"The new winner I wish this nice feeling of victory, but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which abolishes mindless regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdité of the year for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The survey inglorious winner this year on the Absurdité of the year was the requirement to bring in the offices of documents that employees can get online.
Over one-third of 4,000 voters have voted for it.
For example, the social affairs authorities asked for a paper extract from the register of commerce, while the official can get two clicks of a mouse.
Change thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance no longer will seek the extract from the register of commerce for controls on payments of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech administration of social insurance (CSSZ).
Highlight all the regulations and executive orders that companies and contractors must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those absurd is the meaning of this competition for the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If the voters 3,000 last year occurred, it is at least 4,000 this year who have made their voices heard.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that do that dampen the business, and increasingly.
"We are perhaps at the number of documents to fill for tax returns for the top places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world does not improve the situation in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic at the 74 th place as regards the conditions for the company, which is 8 places more compared to last year.
The competition for the Absurdité of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006, and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report each year administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to late September, last time before the closing of the competition.
Report on the website: firmaroku.CZ. Then, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for "antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on the site. firmaroku.CZ/absurdita and at ihned banking.
The Absurdité who received the greatest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey of the past year, it is a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and décrêts who have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" competition, therefore one of the nominees is for example the requirement that the vehicle maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or while entrepreneurs with 20 employees, paint two offices and two washrooms every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a happening attended regularly personalities from the public and political life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises of Czech Republic, Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the climax of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot function when the state puts âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to remove the absurd décrêts is not a weapon in the water.
In 2007, which did not appeal to the people was the contractors' obligation to declare three days before the office for the individual enterprise to the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or a Pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was abolished with the ammendement of the Act on the individual enterprise.
The second obligation the most popular in 2007, which was to say to the Labour Office travel service for a foreign employee in 30 days, has been removed with the text of legislation on the so-called green card.
And everything is OK until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdité of the year 2009 has been the décrêt for the physiotherapists have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards firms responsible socially.
Are assessed environmental, humanitarian projects, training or even sports.
The novelty of this year's Noviny Hospodarske competition, which is already there for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the support to the fair and reasonable business.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the operator of mobile phone firm Vodafone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, are listed companies which have not passed with a long-term goal only for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich inspirations and an article independent would edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another can consider their support activity and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns people with disabilities and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic is not a society of prologiciels And pragoise Netera that supports the creation of informal sports teams for their employees who are then involved in number of tournaments in various sporting disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of Pardubice is Isolit society - Bravo for 17 years the main contributor to the endowment, which sponsors the children with disabilities.
In fact address employees with health problems are still The old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad which employs more than 70% and, for this, has been awarded the title of the firm responsible for the central region of Bohemia and which has placed third in the region at the Firm contest of the year organized by Vodafone.
Olomouc, it's MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which won for having introduced work schedules more flexible and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average, and without, proportionellement, loss of wages.
The board also déverné the title because she achête priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the close and cares about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit in the Usti Region also think the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the services of catering to a local factory protected for his actions.
"We also support the foundation man in the shadows, which helps the Roma community," said Ondrej SUCHY, the representative of the company.
At the very last row is located, also for its activities, a visibly and cleaning company in the region of Karlovy Vary, who participates in the pensions of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standard.
"In our society we are contributing to food, transportation, the increase of qualifications and recreation," said Joseph Strapac of the construction company bruntal Czasch winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
Were automatically enrolled in the class society, all regional finalists for the competition of the Firm of the Year of Vodafone, which had responded to the questionnaires attached document for registration and had referred to the organizer before 15 August.

"The independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the principal of the Firm contest of the year," said Karel Goldman Bison&Rose organizer of the agency.
The Fund for Lands in Plzen, police carried out arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Fund for Lands Plzen, anti-corruption police carried out arrests in recent days.
Detectives spent the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and trader in real estate Lubos. G..
It had tried to manipulate precisely a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed site is secured by a candidate determined.
It had to pay Lubos G. half a million kronor.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police is pursuing an individual for insider trading in the context of a tender and a public concour." said the newspaper Pravo the head of the procuracy Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
Police have recovered after 24 hours this contractor 46 years in freedom.
To know how it could affect a public competition, we can only speculate so little official information.
In a matter of Pravo, the fund's spokesman Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen on a separate workplace, and during the public competition.
"It was a client and in any case of an employee, she says.
The public competition, according to Cerna as a true name "call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the ground" and is put in place when occur several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their resitutions rights that must be resolved before is announced the value of the land."
"According to the rights proposed a classification of purchasers is put in place and the Fund transferring the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," said the spokesman of the Fund.
G. Lubos, it is clear, the information about the people who had registered with the appeal and as he is himself, also a person benefiting as having purchased a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to field candidates not participate in the competition.
And he cashing probably is to withdraw.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
G. Lubos had contacts largely above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
It appeared in the case of the former leader of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted in criminal for having published land for which they had already edited the decision establishing a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained for example land earmarked for the construction of public communications, specifically instead was to be constructed the artery of access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later, speaks with the town hall for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The town was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardising the construction by a blockage of the land.
Households will pay a surcharge of 100 kronor monthly for housing.
Households will from January pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some areas rents will also increase.
Families must therefore from January draw from their wallets until a hundred kroner each month more than now.
Electricity increases 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2% more expensive, in certain localities you will have to pay up to one tenth of world's supply of water and in many places the central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be close to households apartment 100 kronor annually more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced the price of electricity because of the sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energies, including photovoltaÏques batteries.
The gas is increasing moderately, but of course when people most need to heat and therefore have a greater consumption.
You can therefore count also 100 kronor more.
While electricity and gas are rising throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from town to town.
This is mainly the largest common planning price increases.
For example, or Hradec Kraloce Pardubice households will pay starting in January for the central heating almost 50 kronor more per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1,000 kronor annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9% for water and sanitation for the case where the city is increasing rents infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still part of the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are higher, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
The price of rents will rise significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January - at the end of regulation.
For example the ICC Byty company that owns Usti nad Labem nearly 2,500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increased rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regulated rents that pay people in almost 300,000 apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children are saoûlent rum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and is slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks which most often those who are saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years between the hands of the physician.
Children who are cared for at the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is a result of the experience of physicians who face similar admissions children's departments of hospitals.
"The beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be saoûl."
"The trend is really the spirits," says Ludek Pravo Pelikan, head of children department of the hospital in Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they succeed in vines to Dad a bottle in the cupboard, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka prévalent'.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix with juice and thus not feel," said the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, it vindicates.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It is now alcohol fashionable, particularly in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it has acted to slivovice they have brought down the house," said Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, see drunken children aged 13 to 14 years for admissions to hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to working at Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he held 10 years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren nearby broad drunk.
"A girl was hospitalized four times
"She acommencé her career at 12 years old when she was introduced with 3.5 per thousand alcohol dansle blood with more a mixture with ecstasy," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was at the Parc des Expositions Holesovice at a party."
"What is interesting is that it did not develop bizarre to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours" surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the lack of parents or their tolerance out of the joint deal with the fact that their offspring are indulging in the beverage which are the main cause of the development of alcoholism children.
According to the experts, however, not dependence, speaks in the strict sense, for the children.
"Under the heading" alcoholic refers to a dependency chronic alcohol for several years with all the resulting phenomena, but that is not found among children. "
"Among those who use alcohol to repetition, it is rather a back ground socio-family significantly negative," explained the head of Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesman, approximately 40 drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric outpatient clinic at Motol.
There are integrated into the stastistiques with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization.
Drunken children who are after emergency care brought back home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
Besides the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite in three Pélikan seasonal waves with which we can count: the day witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by spite after poor results on the contrary they are celebrating the start of the holidays."
"Of course I lived day witches an admission of 7 children drunk a single shot," said Pélikan.
The drunk child who has spent the night at the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and is suffering the aftermath of the "hung over."
The headache of the morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are removed by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they spend a great evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurt."
"They are just amazed at the place where they are located," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time in this spoiling the spirits of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of kronor.
"From time to time, I applied it as a means of education for these children by counting how much their drunkenness claimed and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their shrinking management, which should recover from the parents expenses related to care, does not address the cases of children drunk.
Two planes L - 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two planes L - 159 for five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa Bill 295M, have departed Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer.
This is the first time that devices of this kind become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
Yet they were abroad in the framework of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are biplaces versions of L 159T1 who were until now in service in the Czech army and who were in a state of flight.
Lestrois remaining devices are monoplaces versions of the L - 159.
They stop for a moment in Aero Vodochody and the intermediary business - the firm Omnipol last week - has taken into account.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical separation from Vodochody aircraft is unknown at this time.
"Airplanes L - 159 monoplaces planned for the exchange were made on aircraft stored for a long time without charges or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The biplaces L - 159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater since the department was signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million kroner for the transformation of four monoplaces L - 159 unused in two biplaces.
The army has taken delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS pledged to introduce the aircraft in the equipment in some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract is clearly stated that whoever takes the planes L - 159 account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one that takes into account in determining how to achieve that," said Pejsek.
Noviny Hospodarske, there are some time announced that the Spanish army is not interested in the L - 159.
The exchange of five L - 159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not publicly tendered and contacted directly EADS.
The direction of the defense arguments while the exchange provides a future export L - 159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought Aero Vodochody 72 aircraft and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will probably legal implications.
The European Commission has nonetheless complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been selected in the framework of a tender to the European level and in any case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three planes Casa, the latter should arrive at the airport in Prague Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer ring fingers is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer ring fingers are exposed to a lower risk of having a prostate cancer.
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of fingers serves as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, especially for men before age 60," proclaimed the coauthor of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger and could help determine what men should undergo the test of prostate cancer, particularly in combining with the genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors such as family health antécedents, added Eeles.
During the period of 1994-2009 it has followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with cancer of the prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand men healthy.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than ring fingers.
For them, as for the 19% of those who had the fingers of the same length, was found the same probability of a prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer ring fingers the risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60 reduced risk has reached 87 percent.
The report of length of two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - including different levels of sex hormones which is exposed the child in the womb.
At least testosterone longest an index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone, which helps in the development of a prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, Czech geneticist renowned and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said TKC that he is aware of this study, but that it appears not, it seems, that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely proven."

The US has a new "smart weapon"
The US military has sent Afghnistan a new "smart" weapon, simply known as -25 XM code.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
The projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few metres.
The special caliber ammunition for the rifle 25 mm developed and containing an explosive highly breaking, operates in fact like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed so that they explode on contact with the target, but also at any point of its ballistic trajectory.
We can therefore use against an enemy that hides behind a barrier, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected from above and when it falls above a rain lethal shards of steel, it can out of combat also.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of XM -25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier is used mainly in such a way that it finds the target, sends a laser beam which determines the distance, gives a specific target point, according to which it corrects its target site and based on the trigger.
"Let's say you referred to 543 meters."
"When you rushed the trigger, the gun charge and earns the distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1. 2, 3 meters, said Audette.
400 jobs off-shored
The group Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 staff will transfer to Astro Park their place of work which is currently at the office building in the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As said Wednesday the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women up to now, located on the Marienbader place in the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, huge office block on the rue Lyoner Straße Quartier Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman said that in the medium-term, the group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The supply of rental was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park open offices are best suited to collaborators working style.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt - Niederrad is for us a very important site with a remarkable infrastructure."
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region has sparked yesterday the joy of winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith on the place of establishment."
Fujitsu is appropriate for the city and its implementation constitutes an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations would not able to change the difficulties of computer manufacturer in response to the owner of the building in Marienbader Place.
Ultimately, however, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to avoid a place if exceptional remains vacant for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
A decade ago, the building of the Hôtel Place de Ville, used up here by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical," as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
Result of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and City Hall. It triggered many criticisms, not only because of the impressive development of previously partly parking surfaces, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the credit rating and investment advisory firm, Feri, the maker of computers for the travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, have moved into buildings.
In 2006, The Frankfurt German group specialised Immobilien Chancen repurchased buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it puts computers and servers at the disposal of the business and ensures the essential service.
Its branch office in the region Rhine-Main is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu account certainly many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt - Niederrad. Other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named SRT.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been leased in the building Astro Park.
This complex of 20 years old, whose name recalls its star-shaped houses including the headquarters of the Confederation of electronic and electrical engineering industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is finding it increasingly difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hiding political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, stay apparently in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks is attacked with still more force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server housed up here in America and is now seeking an ISP in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent Senator Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, stay probably in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) cyber activists originally revelations via the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, the e-generation company, Amazon, had removed the documents on Wikileaks from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists have been Amazon Web Services (AWS) use in order to be able to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a challenge to Amazon, "they should cease to sell books."
The television channel CNN, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation conducted by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, told the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have liked that Amazon to take this measure earlier due to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said Senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it puts our national security in danger and jeopardize the lives around the world," according to a press release of independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent," 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist constantly called intrigues orchestrated by detractors prosecutions against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats have been made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange concern for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently was reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks should be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the advisor to the Chief Government Mr. stephen Harper said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US President, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and leaked recently, to engage in espionage.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual owner of a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The US government spends now completely bench the protection of its data bases.
According to a press release from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre for the fight against terrorism, has been named responsible for combating the leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House has also will check the means by which any administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US government has announced that he intended to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if ever they were threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have implemented to come into contact with them," said the spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect if necessary."
The University of the Glace
"University Gelato" Bologna, it prepares confectioners ice the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course organized for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from throughout the world.
In fact, where any ice?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German confiseur ice somewhat old-fashioned, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian art manufacturing ice.
The turbine ice removes ice cream from the window chilled using a spatula, available in the gaufre and then begins to sell.
To find out, it does not need to go to Anzola dell' Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières based university ice in 2003 so that the ice creams sorties of its machines everywhere meet Italian high ideals.
The three-day introductory course organized for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and stretching over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private glacerie.
In the midst of a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their strong desire to smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, professor of art education came from California is a great lover of the Slow Food movement. He wants the country to propose a European product quality in the future of the industrial Enukso.
Berlin Anke Advisor business management and it wants, after a few years, learn something singular trade experiencing for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another time Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning woman came because her kids love ice cream Italian.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari explained to the participants the ideal characteristics perfect ice.
Decisive is not just the right flavor, but also the soyeuse flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano not forgotten during the training the icing on the cake for National superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice is simply the best - and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, to milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer heated to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then refrigerate immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a spigot installed on the machine: it fate a white base pasteurized cream, foundation for all kinds of ice milk.
The trainer is immediately assailed question: is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizing?
How can people unleash the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being mislead by the spirit of the time.
Those who do not speak that ice "manufactured from natural ingredients," may have nevertheless used stabilizers: the more often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without use of stabilizing, only need to sell within a period of 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer does not croquera anything other than ice pellets.
Some amendments to the basic mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
Petty Officer Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that it acquires in the radius of the supermarket fruit or sweets.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of ingredients flavoured."
"However, you should simply try."
In the fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the ice cream manufactured from the mass of white base, adding egg becomes a yellow cream and is, when we add cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all the participants during must move to the use of machines to ice.
Luciano invites from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnuts with or without eggs in the mass base, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice in fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The ice at the kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit and less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mix correctly notes the taste of ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: if you use the purée fishing with lots of sugar, it is important that the quantity of sugar is reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the wine growers are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the paintings facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic machine manufacturing base mass support.
There is also a device in which it beats simultaneously the mixture of ice available to make it onctueux and reduced to negative temperatures.
In spite of all the automatisations, minor outages are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo barbouille from fruit purée head-to-toe, éclabousse comrades studies when control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes.
Petty Officer Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident such may occur at each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that has pioneered the culture of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Group of Experts Testbiotech which is regarded as an institute independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we know," said Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some reports of what the Chair of the Expert Group Efsa for genetically modified, Dr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively to the development of testing requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified and is, thus, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed match verbatim, paragraphs, to the position taken by the Ilsi lobby group and thus bear the imprint of the industry which, basically, would be monitored by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of the Efsa has recently joined without condition or without transitional period the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta., It has changed camp.
There is little time, even the Central German Radio Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union responsible for monitoring and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion as well the German Federal Agency for the Environment that MEPs.
However, the Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it operates all data, including those in the industry as long as they are of good quality work.
It does not prohibit experts working for the account of the Efsa to establish contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who owns, among others, in the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr. Then resent the fact that plants genetically modified to be accepted without any trial feeding animals and that it has not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what they are, for example, the impact of corn genetically modified in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the proteins isolated and not all the genetically modified plant, which does not obtain reliable results.
"If you don't search risks, how can we find?" wonders Mr. Then on an accusatory tone.
It is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific researches since 1994 in the field of genetics and currently works at the Polytechnic in Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector increasingly is trying to influence or discredit scientists criticism.
Therefore, there is barely even researchers who are not linked to societies.
The opinions of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry control research on security."
The traces of stone
Uli Gsell obtained a total 400 kilo about.
Monday afternoon, she was faced with the train station in Stuttgart with its tube in the back.
There was manif.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September, excavators came out and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the Central Station in Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the cessation of construction.
Shattered by 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a paved stretch out and rude poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years living in Ostfildern.
He obtained some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not be lost."
He says enthusiastically: "Modest and cheap, simple and land a rock."
He arguing that splitting the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is unclear what he will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli also Gsell.
Traces of stones of Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire of stones.
The 44-year-old man is the trade of old stones.
It has bought all the stones emerged from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace if they were crushed or if they disappear into the landfill," he says in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He recounts that he has been the subject of insults and threats when in September, newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing of the demolition company.
But he has negotiated for days with the project's adversaries S21.
And he said that he could do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it occurs, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 subsequently swept away one parallélépipède stone weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some Guard as memory while hoping also to be able to make the reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tonnes, 25 full loads a truck.
About half is still packed together in the forest, the rest being long since sold.
Owners of gardens and landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and washed away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones scandal of Stuttgart turned long "Mäuerle" or limitations of turf grasses.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"Had it not been this political component."
It enters its all-terrain car, made the turn of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He has been studying law that it has abandoned. Later, he began to study the biology before interest subsequently computer and eventually becoming a carrier.
And an amateur stones.
It stores 40,000 tonnes.
He amassed treasures everywhere in Germany.
He says that it is the largest dealer of ancient stones.
It is réfrène.
The carved stones of sand with art are posed on the snow.
"Previously, They were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot," he says with enthusiasm.
"My favourite stone."
It takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a bunch of fingers: red sand Pierre, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so forth.
"Pretty travertin."
The parallélépipède that were once part of the forum of the Neckarstadion Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the travertin Cannstatt from the prefecture of police, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St Blasien, tuff from Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once constituted the stones were carved by hand and displaced using simple comparisons and carts drawn by oxen, it becomes quite respectful.
"This would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in room."
It did not become rich, still less rich.
But the carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, a sculptor, a blacksmith, of stonecutters, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is rewarding," says the recycler of waste.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent struggle to conquer the high potential
The counter is facing intense overcrowding.
16 students are lining up to buy bread rolls to salmon, tomato sauce and white mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automobile manufacturer Volkswagen have invited students in design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
In the context of a sort of competition of ideas, they must talk trades on the car of the future with the developers of VW, and, in passing, knowing the Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-to-hand in competition to find best brains and to commit, like Volkswagen, in a multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the brightest graduates as much as possible in the theatres before they arrive on the job market and that they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performance of their students, trying to spot the talent in the context of practical projects and loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig auto group amadoue talent.
A young lady of staff sharing pens, candy and cards with the logo of Volkswagen.
She speaks of the timing of placements and student jobs for young talent; it shows the roads for access to the compound of the group.
It's Nico Selle Technical University of Braunschweig, who is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "The students come in contact with the industry and are gaining experience."
"The Volkswagen group, he may know the students, looking more closely at the candidates seriously and appreciate those who enter online account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, A such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"In the past, focusing instead on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become even more intense.
In goods sectors, companies can no longer recruit collaborators screening on a plethora of candidates.
But they need to boast about their reliability and especially woo the hands of highly skilled.
They are mostly The graduates from engineering clusters that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 posts engineers remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum on the positions of engineer still grows.
Dykta novel is hunting for talent for KPMG, auditing firm, accounting and consultancy.
It organizes costly events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the race cruise KPMG - Race, a species of rally - paper where competitors must find their way to the aid of GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they may travel this way the United States.
Participants may incidentally visit subsidiaries of KPMG and know the business.
The one who should participate decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of cream of many candidates will depart for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little thing"
For the hunter talent that is Mr. Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are on the verge of completing their education and want to soon send their applications to our company." he says.
Outside of the direct amadouement carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized companies quite classic participating in trade fairs, where they engaged in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve the graduates participating in trade shows."
"For example, in the lounge of solar technologies," says Sitha Stübe, director of human resources for Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem related to the succession.
Currently, 35 posts are set to contest on the website of the company.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through the university professors.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The professors suggest that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his project end of study among us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among specialists from the sun.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertisement highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do it," says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
Long ago that money no longer holds the lead role in the search for employment.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld sits in 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual Honour German employers.
To this end, he mulling collaborators on their level of satisfaction in relation to their work and its background while watching the framework conditions for employees.
The chief of staff, Ms. Stübe hopes that this investment will enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
"I think that the candidates are relying primarily on external assessments in relation to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German DEBA Academy (Deutscher Employeur Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises businesses that want to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means above all to take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to get attractive is through its own staff," he says.
It is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the brand of the employer within its own workforce.
"The collaborators satisfied form the best messengers."
When it treats its employees well and that they identify with the company, they are just advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if it was playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida State in the Southeastern United States, over the years to come.
The government in Washington gave an equivalent ban A ban, and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform that is at the origin of this strict prohibition: it must remain in force at least for the next five years.
Faced with this accident which cost the lives of 11 people and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the business sector, had indicated that he was willing to allow the completion of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution and want to reduce the US dependence on foreign countries in terms of the supply of oil.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the oil slick devastating in golf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing demands for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must present its conclusions December current.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling freeze after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and more stringent safety procedures, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms in depth.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced would remove the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
The actors in this sector of activity now publicly warned against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case until now.
"The government's objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current survey in the area by the auditing firm BDO, before the drilling ban Wednesday.
Indeed, the American Enery Alliance regrets uncertainty this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulations."
Investments made in new support projects have been deferred until further order, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
Water flowing into rivers is oiled brown; outlines a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the country's Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men of theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"You don't épuisez," launches the environmentalist to journalists for the calm: "You still enough oil sludge before duckweed."
The Nigerian 37 years has tried to photograph a young sunk into the muddy water up to the chest, as well as drag fat that surrounds it: this scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water the color of the rainbow.
You may not realise that the basement is filled with brown slicks of crude oil.
On the shore of the river Bodo Jetty, Esther Badom tells once, she collected whole buckets of shrimp here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
It was five years ago, a huge amount of oil gushed from a pipeline exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo must now pull for six hours to reach fish-bearing waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The extent of the devastation is glaringly obvious leafing through mangrove marshes traversed by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat lashes a maroon cradingue. Anyone who plunges his hand cut off all covered with oil.
The roots of mangrove small emerging soil as liquorice sticks. The isolated palm leave sadly hang their fins.
Swarms of birds are being sought in vain, as there are usually in wetlands: once the outboard engine stops, an eerily silence descends on this paradise once that looks like a gas station by the smell that is formed.
"What happens here, it is war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari a sad: "Our life is characterised by a permanent danger in relation to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni is a battlefield under siege for dozens of years: there are more than 60 years, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was later executed. in 1993, the group Shell was forced to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the homecoming Ogoni is prohibited in this society: while more than 2 million barrel of black gold every day are pumped through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines in the whole of the Delta region, three times larger like Switzerland, the oil fields in the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in the water of the steel trestle as weird sculptures: is very affectionate "Christmas trees" heads of drill holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion until the benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in the piece, because a constant stream of crude oil flows in the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that leaked into the sea during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" there are 21 years old off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who should bear the responsibility of the persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question has divided the actor.
For the Shell Group, pipeline sabotage and the siphonage are responsible for more than 90% of the pollution. Environmentalists for their part see explosions heads of perforated drilling and oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner accused the group Shell to focus less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: only the rate of malfunctions pipes is "still much higher than alleures."
Some forms are emerging of mangroves to a place that, viewed from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of work and installed outdoors: they are completely naked and covered work up to the neck.
A fire twinkling under one of the many tons that sometimes related to the pipe, sometimes scattered without ground on the site must be identified: a small refinery illegal.
There is heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours," explains Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of kerosene raindrops fall and you get diesel.
As Michael and his four colleagues every day four barrels of diesel 300 litres: "We reported 34,000 Naira," approximately 22 dollars.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producer in sub-Saharan countries.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than ridiculously low of barely 40 Euro cents per litre of diesel: because they acquire free their feedstock.
It is offered by the "gatekeepers" who put the network of oil pipelines cut across the country of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant feedstock temporarily stored illegally purified: organized crime networks that are among its members senior politicians and military, charged up the lion's share of tankers and dumping on the world market.
The Akpobari activist believes that the debate on the issue of whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the public or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the fundamentals of the life of the fishermen were not so profoundly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But Meanwhile, the relations of the Ogoni especially to Shell so deteriorated that it was more that the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps that operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they are certainly not the subject of an arrest, but the more they will be offered bribes.
Even the soldiers mostly originating in the north of the country reap as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"At any point of view, this scarf low trick brought our country well," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction flaws in the reactors of the A380
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
In examining a device that has made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Qantas had visibly so far had more luck: during the investigation, the Australian authority for air safety has found that the reactors of some aircraft A380 did present a serious problem of security, and it warns against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue crack and leak at the level of the connection of the conduct of oil, specifies in a statement published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors."
Those affected are Rolls-Royce manufactured reactors and equipping 20 aircraft from the Airbus A380 series.
The Airbus company Qantas, which has had to landing on 4 November in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the French reactor manufacturer.
She has filed a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court, headquartered in Sydney. This approach gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The director of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Rooms are spare and the bearing surface has been damaged during the fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil which is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that additional tests relating to safety will be conducted on the superjumbos who are also equipped with the reactors in question.
Safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The problem of security is regarded as sufficiently important to inform all concerned parties.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Qantas had locked-in ground its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa has replaced by precautionary measure, the A380 reactor.
The double-decker plane is the largest airliner flying in the world.
The snowfall throughout the territory is causing chaos in the transport sector
Germany covered in white: in one night, snow fell on almost all the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is shivering Germany: by freezing temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which led to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow reached 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the winter has worked permanently, but they have not been able to cope with the snow that kept to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal Office of maritime navigation and hydrography (LOS) expects tidal waves occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
The snow piles on federal highways and roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the central warning weather Meteomedia announced purple alert level was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, it has fallen 30 centimetres of fresh snow that fees and strong winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stranded overnight.
Even in the state of saxe Anhalt, police authorities announced severe disruption on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused an interruption of traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall has affected highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, fallen trees on the tracks, caténaires or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, it had to interrupt the inter-regional transport Leipzig - Nuremberg.
Sallfeld, in Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Chutes snow have led to numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman of the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for DRV indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled at Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are more passengers stranded at the airport, despite this barely 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening at Ostholstein, a truck driver lost their lives in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the present layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: even here, a truck at a level crossing was caught because the vehicle was then immobilized.
The driver had lost their lives.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth in Nuremberg has been closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled over on a slippery Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing the good news: the snow is still soft and fluffy, but it tourbillonnera in cases of minor gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent winds and fast.
However, it is very cold up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking an acquirer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to secede from its emblem: according to information reported by newspapers, the financial institution is seeking buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring back up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank just beautify the headquarters of the group: the twin towers located in the Quartier business have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their former place of duty.
Now, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the costs of renovations and it is seeking an acquirer for its two buildings, such as writing in the newspaper " Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesperson.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said: "We are verifying whether it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or sell, and make new rental later."
As the largest financial institution in Germany has already ceded his seat shortly afterwards.
It is only in the middle of the year 2007 that the bank had acquired the Twin Towers for an amount of $272 million Euro to holders of own funds; she had then rehabilitated.
The changes aimed at optimizing energy devoured indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously have a lot of money in the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in the business estimate the value of towers, renamed meanwhile "green Towers," about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, we don't know now whether the buildings will again be sold to a fund belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourned the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the miners buried who were declared dead in the wake of several explosions at a mine.
It had not yet been able to reassemble the bodies because the security situation of the affected wells continues to be precarious.
There are just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth submerged in water.
29 miners whose age lies between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had found no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was not able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second bang violent, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, parents and friends have organized a feast to the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sun to Greymouth submerged in water south of the island New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, was installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photos and personal effects, including clothes and surf boards, had also their place.
The flags were at half-mast to all public buildings in the country.
Prime Minister John Key said participants to the commemorative feast that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the miners actually date back to the surface.
"But they never returned to the house."
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits said that he cannot bring himself to accept the death of his son as long as it has not seen his remains.
Besides the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemorative celebration.
South African and British origins of minors were also buried in the first explosion of 19 November.
Rescuers have begun to put out a fire inside the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The Prefect of Police Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, temperatures burning inside the mine are starting to decline.
Going into hell, warrior!
Is it Splatter the film artificial?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the genre former thanks to his film, "Valhalla Rising" saga of veteran.
What public Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding has it Refn well able to think about turning "Valhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is captured, he escapes his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries after all. It seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses of the brutal methods of assassination. when he was cranky, he severs the intestines of its enemies without waiting until they are dead.
Alternatively, until the end of the film, the one-eyed says no word on his true name. Even the other characters leave escape, at most, one or two sentences detour some appalling screams of agony.
Otherwise, it says nothing and feasting on the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the universe of Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
This would be ideal more mature filmmakers who have an interest in existentialism and for the excellent travellings.
When a film is several target groups, it is unfortunate that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher," his trilogy on fierce drug trafficker and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a bit more mood in the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality cinema art and testing.
Most supporters of cinema art must have the horror in the brain that spreads around and intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, where the one-eyed sailed, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a vessel destined to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the quiet and the mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be quiet.
It is not surprising that "Valhalla Rising" has found no distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, occasionally, hiding behind a bloody and over-the-top appearance.
There is no dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The viewer cannot escape.
Refn give him barely a moment of relaxation and him slowly cut throat with frigid images and a mournful soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that comes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young boy blonde is faithfully alongside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all the other driven by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed heroes whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning itself into warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, in any way, rotten.
"Valhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, that has purpose impatience, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earth-moving work
The agency International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, still less to comply with the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at about midnight, at least four F-15 I Israeli fighter planes attacked a mysterious building cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate, the largest city nearby lies 30 kilometres: it is Dair SA - On.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built reportedly with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing from US intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known under the name of the nearby, el Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
In contrast, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images blurred.
Through the computer-assisted animation, she indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant which is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear plant in Yongbyon.
In addition, she has presented photos showing the building located near or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was located on the verge of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after Israel's bombing raid, there is scarcely more information than at the time, and even with the time the mystery deepens increasingly.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el Kibar, but did not have peu' evidence it developed "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious on this subject and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
When questioned about the way it ensures that it is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat UN has given a terse response by saying that the IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions."
The Syrians have certainly taken away precipitately rubble "unused military building" and proceeded to an orderly resolution of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered el Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a Member State of commercial providers of satellite images showing the time which followed directly attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired exclusive.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret atomic program and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected that argument after analyzing particles in calling it implausible.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion on this subject, as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el Kibar and denied access to the rubble of buildings destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercising at the time of the attack, recently said: "We shall never comments on this subject."
As the investigation of this case spotlight since June 2008 without reaching an outcome and that it "increasingly turning into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as the high-ranking service recognizes a Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to achieve progress, we need to clarify the existence of three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have neither indicated what facilities here, or what is their function or what they suspect contain.
According to information published by the newspaper " Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj aces - Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of the neighbouring towns.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) Washington has identified these locations and found on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would be very likely one suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly beside it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it says that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
Indeed, it is an information provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos indicating that vehicles have been commuting between the three sites and the stone parallélépipède to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve to fuel production."
It would have "no indications concerning sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are vital to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly working through enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is rigour plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where should have come uranium and where could they later separated plutonium needed to manufacture of the bomb.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in three sites.
When hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt have disappeared, nobody will have information on the place of storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has been examined in 1998 the salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres of el Kibar, the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
Analysing recent photos taken by satellite to the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show that Syria has begun landscaping work in the three suspect sites and displaced huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped to dismiss the suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to make. This plan should enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. only time invested shows what interest the inspectors relate to this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
There was a year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency is not reported in this case," says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador that evokes for some months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful ways in which the International Atomic Energy Agency has to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open to the future," but he is undecided.
This method involves a huge risk: firstly, it requires a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA and a good number of the 35 countries that are represented have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as the diplomat who gives to challenge: "At this point, if at the end they do not find anything"
Love in wartime
It is going badly since Angelina Jolie has made its debut as a director.
She has written the script itself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it is enough to provoke discomfort.
A persistent rumour suggests that the woman, a Muslim, fell love with his executioner Serbian during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women federations have immediately protested. In response, shooting planned in Sarajevo some sequences have been displaced in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the movie is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the Canadian High Commission of the United Nations for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress. Lovely is itself of goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat. There are a few weeks already, she has offered these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"The meeting should be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There has been no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie said enough about his attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that, subsequently, the Hasecic organization recommended the High Commission of the United Nations to withdraw the quality of Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie she wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of his scenario, awarded after some hesitation authorization for filming in Sarajevo, but we don't know why not now comes despite this authorization.
The young author assures itself that it does not seek political goals with his film, that it is doing a lot of effort that it was aware of the Yugoslav conflict. It maintains that it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and give the opportunity for all parties prenante to speak.
However, it remains vague about the content.
As a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Net. It is quite different: lovers knew well before the start of the war. it will meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a custodian.
This is even a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is amourache its executioner."
That the movie Jolie had begun well before the war, of course.
The pressures on it, and speaks Jolie, is "unfair and based on erroneous information."
Now, only the fanatics Hollywood can provide peace: placing illegally this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let us draw us!
Tonight, everything goes back well among the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans howl of joy amid a strong music, they trample feet.
Baileyu - Pub in Cork in southern vibrates because the players are launching and succeed in overcoming the table tennis balls at a distance of three metres in cups beer from the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer pong." The winner gets 500 Euros plus a ticket allowing him to travel in January in Las Vegas at the World Championships of beer - pong.
Cian does this Tanner is a calm individual; the subtle game to drink and reserved computer specialists, these two behaviours are not really well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years is looking to have fun, to turn on the térébrante issue, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, he will lead discussions hiring in New Zealand.
"I do have a strange feeling," he says.
"The homeland is so far and I did not work."
Finally: his girlfriend sitting in Auckland, "in less than two, she won her desired job as project leader factual, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of the bleak outlook for the country, two of the three sisters Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin now occupies a position of computer consultant in London.
The young go: the status of most families living on the island are similar to those of tanning.
Experts from the Institute of Social and Economic Research indicate that 100,000 Irish soon leave their country.
They also provide a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these predictions materialize, it will be a common emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a great comfort, the grief is now taking place.
The economic crisis, however, affects mostly young Irishman, well trained, who have known until now only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under 30 years old are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published extensively readers' letters written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is going to drift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the person who has the opportunities, and our country is a generation."
"The last to leave extinguished light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of Irish students, sees pointing a darker future because the government simply throw dust in the eyes and offers no prospect of future for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the 20-year-old student.
She sees how his comrades cling to a practicum not paid to another.
She said that his greatest concerns is to emigrate itself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively address this topic.
McLarnon organizes the show "WorkingAbroadExpo" that offers full support on the theme "working abroad."
"But the work abroad is new to the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the ranks of the hierarchy," said the head.
His website shows photos of Web surfers in Australia and the snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a mess, but it ensures also freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seàn O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for the engineer of 29 years, he is now working with Irish colleagues 15 in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house precisely fate of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other Hannovre projects or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan will visit rarely his native country, because it is involved in a position of extra work, in order to be able to finish repaying the loan agreed to build a house in the homeland.
"The situation is already a little bonkers," he said in crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I won money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live now."
He broke out of an embarrassed laugh through the coolers.
The small house is in a residential area with gardens before well cared for, expensive cars of major brands are stationed on the access routes.
There are four years, O'Donovan has bought the house in common with her sister for an amount of 380,000 euros, funded 100% by the credit.
"It was moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy," he says.
Afraid to see crumble because of the credit?
O'Donovan ponders a moment, ressert hot tea and says: "I don't have children to maintain and I'm young; even going around, I can start fresh."
The engineer of the building does not like the wailing that he hears often lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what was once lived here on the island," he says.
"Working for a time abroad, this is not what can happen worse, perhaps it is this fact that we felt first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
The idea pleases Cian does this Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his charts, It already has a few years of work in London. This is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and for his girlfriend.
But there is still something that worries many in recent days: the party to organize the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that it could mutate into evening farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said over a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it seems, even disturbing."
"Call it instead an evening of goodbye, relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The routine democratic
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as the private company.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest survey Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and exclusive published by The Economist.
Given that the survey was conducted regularly since 1995, it tracks changes of attitude in the region.
Two elements stand out the results of the survey this year, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the sunny enough mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has risen significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy fell from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has rebounded after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents from the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy in their country functioned in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase over the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34 percent said they had confidence in the parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases, but sharp increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If it has held good during the financial crisis worldwide, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries of America have suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong rebound.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America has reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty have increased only slightly in 2009 and has again fallen this year, 32%).
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inàcio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
Only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see Table 5).
About 31 percent say they or a loved have been victim of a crime during the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase of support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents from the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for the development, against 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58 percent believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47 percent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their president left, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest cheerleader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11 percent since last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote tainted
No one expected to have the perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the stricken country and plunged into the fear.
There were polling boxes and a new election, ballots scattered in goutières polling stations ransacked and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, walked in the neighbourhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen candidates in the presidential election, including several suspected favourites, have denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "a pretty good election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously "that they did not believe these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, Past-President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round expected is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal that the vote be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million quake survivors still live in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In the case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 identification cards needed to vote, were not yet distributed little time before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians do themselves.
The soft towards the centre
Weeks after being suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernàndez, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, more than 50%; this is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, turn this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year might depend on the choice of Ms. Fernàndez, visibly in mourning, that it would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs are still confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of preparing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has led to the first couple to spend the extra revenue at will.
The government of Ms. Fernàndez has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissident members of the Malvinas movement to power rallied to Ms. Fernàndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a Parliamentary struck in the face one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), the Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to compete," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater flexibility to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage demands of the unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of growth and the reduction of poverty, instead of controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which was conducted in the falsification of statistics on official inflation.
Ms. Fernàndez can now moderating these policies?
She has called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been buoyed by high world prices for agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the extra boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that's why Ms. Fernàndez shows signs of wanting to re-establish financial relations with Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring forced debt that Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Ms. Now Fernàndez seems to be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped NIs the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6. 7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But the last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; what looks like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernàndez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does so, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When the Argentinians will be returned from their summer holidays on Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will be dropped.
If she wants to win another election, it will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, silently, many policies of her husband.
Half a Hurrah! For China
Taiwanese voters are geared towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What is Taiwan think of its big brother located on the other side of the Taiwan Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters were presented on 27 November, 70% of those eligible to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, in the context of what is considered an overall assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for the feelings from the mainland, which has developed innovative business ties, including a free-trade pact partial, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five town halls, he has failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead of this, the Democratic Party, Progressive (DPP), which moved toward full independence of Taiwan, has won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of votes of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event was unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including campaign hoopla trucks and flags of mass rally with girls who danced in required minimum.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt has also been committed.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chair of the KMT, toured election for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, injuring and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it has not been determined whether the gunman wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, said Ing - wen Tsai, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had consequences on the election officer suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how the issue of mainland itself was absent.
Instead of this, the candidates have continued with plans for public housing and creating jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence of fact and hate the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid parading its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also failed to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese firms are vital to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for his part, has claimed responsibility for confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
We can expect that the Beijing government continues to provide commercial facilities, according to its strategy which aims to lure Taiwan, homecoming.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Admittedly, it would like to see a political integration; but let us start from the beginning.
Better to wait for this until after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has anyway reinvented.
There are two years ago, he was going wrong: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent in prison following charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates saw the day under the direction of Ms. Tsai and PDP implements to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng chang, who has served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is currently doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can be held without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the public in Taiwan that his party offers an "alternative trusted" compared to the rushed approach of Mr. Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He has even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will find it hard to choose between its potential candidates.
It is important that the KMT should make introspection yourself.
Assessments of Mr. Ma was weak; despite a spiralling economic growth, the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said that his firm and its local partners will be realigned.
The good results of the HRP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the approximation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Nominations for Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Conduct at the request of a chairman, and people are required to read.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassiste and singer of 26 years picked by hand by President Obama to occur during the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of "best new artist."
Considering that Spalding is a known very figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not go out over three albums before registration; what "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," was certainly a step forward and, given its slightly Kirchberg28 vocal style, his hand skillful pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a shaded Spalding relative to the resounding success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voters of the Grammy Awards in light of jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album," a drive on a shudder invigorating a recording that was one of the overarching favourites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" claviériste John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favourite to the husky voice of New Orleans and invited frequent "Treme" for HBO, has been honoured in the contemporary jazz category, which also relented strongly towards some merger with albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognition in the category whole; in competition with the rich chamber - jazz Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose album "pathways" for his octet's performances was an example of the hand of this bassiste as a democratic leader.
Appointment of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards annual contain a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Top appointments include "deus Ex Machina" Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes."
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony number 4, "Los Angeles," a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and who opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also nominated for an award.
Conventional appointments are divided into 13 categories covering the orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year featuring five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album are the Symphonies n °3 and 4 Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and SYNERGY Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the famous" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" Berg Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" Adolf Hasse Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love" Saariaho Kaija Associative Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer ' Rodion Shchedrin Orchestra and Choir Mariinsky Theatre; and" Ivanhoé " Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition Pärt account for the Symphony number 4, Daugherty for "deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze "Appassionatamente Plus, Magnus Lindberg for" Graffiti "and Shchedrin" The Wanderer Enchanted ."
The Symphony number 4 Pärt had his first Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa Pekka Salonen.
About 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, jailed tycoon in Russia.
The "Concerto Mandolin" Dorman has been nominated for her delivery instrumental soloist with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he wrote aviat 15 minutes specially for the interpreter to mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.

In the category of conventional blends, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for their recording "roots: my life, my song"
The project of the mosque in Temecula won the approval of the planning commission.
A proposed mosque in Temecula has received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics have taken to the project by claiming that he was promoting both terrorism and the traffic jams.
But the commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious centre was complying with local laws and that it would be an aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, taking the floor Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a US citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," said.
"They were just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and lasted until almost midnight, most of the time, people voting for or against the centre, at roughly split speaking time, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate has continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is more America," wrote one player.
"It's another planet of the Apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the attacks of 11 September 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of the order of 135 families co- exist without incident in the County of Riverside for years but she wanted more space and better than the warehouse that she has rented on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque in 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on Route Nicolas about two miles to the east of the lyceum Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against the project to the local council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life really" foreign ," said Paul W. C. Davies from the State University of Arizona, coauthor of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to grow after having replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of the State University of Arizona, coauthor of the report.
The discovery is important in research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize the life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, which has not disclosed the details of the discovery, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extra-terrestrial life.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, organizations may be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that" standard "all of the elements that we believe are absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institut de Recherche Scientifique global and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe - Simon of the Institute of Astrologie of NASA, who led the study, has chosen the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it was speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances may be able to substitute one another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the agencies have difficulty distinguishing these components separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different that it doesn't work exactly as phosphorus; he penetrates the interior and, somehow, gum our biochemical machine," said Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ -1 and were exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that he can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that a form of life that use arsenic may occur naturally, or elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, the researchers have hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used.
This suggests that there may be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the research team from Wolfe - Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two exhibition stolen dogs were found in Compton
The two other dogs exhibit on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, sheriffs in the county of Los Angeles announced Thursday.
The four dogs exhibition - two akitas and two corgis Welsh pembroke - have disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others were found in late evening Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Sheriff's Department of Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good form."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dog had been found, in what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say," Davutoglu Whitmore said.
"We are following orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, have not been able to be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
The Sheriff's deputies found the pickup truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a male 3 years, and Didi, a female 10 months - were unharmed, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter corgis, Rickard and Peek had planned to show the regional competitions this week, for the account of Japanese dog owners, were reported missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the national championat "akc/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they accounted present Trace.
Other dogs were expected to participate in other competitions scheduled in the days before the exhibition "akc/Eukanuba," said Peek to the Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the judgments of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and garent their truck outside, right beside the window of their room.
They have taken three other dogs - a puppy Boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the chamber of the motel.
But they have left the Akitas and the corgis, the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be more charges.
They have a few open windows, so that dogs can get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard have reported the theft of the truck to 6 hours Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted for identification.
It is not clear if a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to be new, the restructuring of MGM no longer expects the go-ahead final court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the go-ahead to start again from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, officially praised Thursday the "prepackaged" plan by the creditors that approximately $5 billion in debt would be erased, paving the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision on Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, no legal obstacle will remain before MGM to recover afloat under the tutelage of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General of what will be a studio Lite.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 to 400 at the outset.
MGM will not emerge really Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase has not entered into a $500 million credit facility, expected to finance new operations and MGM productions.
It is being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which meets itself to $75 million, and should be funded to mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. has been hired to advise management on how to put its finances because it lacked the means to pay the interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In the month of August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work in Krispy Doughnuts Kreme.
Moelis and Cooper attempts to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and satisfy the studio more than 140 creditors have taken much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company in sales.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders including none was willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more whose creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, he had to redo as the team of MGM had begun work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, has finally been approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fate of bankruptcy in the following weeks, the companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Businesses of Cooper, who had collected 375,000 dollars per month for their services branch of the company, will receive a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum account boost production of MGM, which is released only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that come from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to conclude a separate loan between 265,000,000 dollars $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of the debt of MGM, has tried to achieve an amalgamation of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the video game system from Microsoft, Kinect, the two can make a significant dent in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game cost the same price as 10 cords to skip traditional pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of Play - Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R." us and BJ Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more power, while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with Web sites, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys to button cell batteries are increasing, and toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R." us, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing - - my jigging (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys of the size of a guinea pig India who sing a note when you press its tummy.
Pressure is equal to a score, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, singing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you cannot stop.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Based on the technology of Elmo Live last year, the animatronic doll 14 inches plays rotational games like Simon peacekeeping and can dance lunar thanks to its feet articulated innovative with blocking the wheels.
Children who have essyaé the toy Mickey uses as an instructor dance while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a rucksack of playing cards questionnaire designed to transform an automobile ride in a session with a self correction and a binder of valves.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is less expensive and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
IXL Fisher-Price ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses a type iTunes system to provide electronic games and books and is equipped with an entry for DS card which allows display of family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to train words by placing the blocks online before the time lag, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, the toys have a sort of online connection.
By not relying on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy a pet to your child's on-line Club Penguin, for example, you can obtain a Penguin Disney Club 2 Mix ' N Match Figure Pack, $5 for those 6 to 12 years) that includes a sharp piece of a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits to store Club Penguin for two articles in the choices.
It may be in-line skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (dollars 10 for 5 years and older) is the latest micro robots to pile button.
The false blue-tongued bug moves quickly on silicone pasta 12 vibrating in random directions.
It is amusing to make a maze of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a temporary shift in the mouth of our dog.
Bring a milder side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait a place in the city as an urban sergeant training inspecting severely expenses nerve, in low voices issuing orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - giant responsible for public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - transmit some impression on a set of spectators.
"Keep right!"
"You can be perçantes!"
Teach your children, he said, "what beautiful girls!"
Four girls barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and pants identical color olive, stiffened up at attention.
Four pairs of shoes black heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly perched atop hair attached by a node removed in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of urban inspectors to China.
A city has required that all new recruits have a high degree of study.
Guangdong province has exchanged the grey - green uniforms against a blue supposedly more committing.
Wuhan, Central China, has replaced the drop them - eyes by how strong:: in 2009, a report indicated that 50 officers had circled a trolley fondness uncontrollable with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the huckster packed up his business and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its police of urban street of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, the sculpts and their young age.
The idea is to give the police dégrossie a milder, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulties to attract the eye to this underground urban brigade of China
And, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these agents are allowed only to enforce municipal ordinances imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the province of Hubei was beaten to death after an observer that he has used his mobile phone to film the train to disperse a protest against a waste landfill.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors from Beijing, looted and put online, describes how defeat effectively offenders without issuing of blood.
This year in Shanghai, a Watermelons huckster was abandoned with a brain injury after a brawl with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available through online downloads, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," said last year's China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth polemic on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district has spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real duties or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer appears to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district demanded of female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years, having a nice silhouette and "five facial in the right order."
They must have a size higher than the average, which is 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at 26 years is compulsory.
Officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"It's their image that is important," said some district officer at Rednet.com, a website quasi government.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc"
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
Chengguan women are as flower vases, Davutoglu said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management office of the district of the city, not adheres to this description.
But he noted that the requirements concerning the height were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
Such is the case of the requirement on the order of facial features.
This means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Admittedly, the disabled or disfigured need not apply.
"We cannot let a person who box or a hunchbacked serving here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrol the place near a monastery Baoguang, aged 22 and has cheeks pommelées with a finely incurvées mouth.
It does not consider the enhancement of its appearance as sexist, d'Addario said.
"Do you think I'm sexy air in this uniform?" she asked with a wry air.
Xu Yang, his colleague dimpled aged 21 years, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose that their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed on larger career ambitions than simply hunting vendors in alleyways where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell the greatest possible buns or bowls of tofu before taking off.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We have already said several times!," said Ms. Xu then that a vendor had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle cart noodles.
Officers describe their functions rather monotonous and tough.
"This is roughly the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property sellers.
They can only threaten to report violators to their male superiors.
This tends to protect public exhibitions sudden animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spreading of false rumours that chengguan officers had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and chengguan officers were wounded, 14 vehicles government were overthrown or set to fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of houses in the placid Baoguang place, where the female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers have confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was yelling to the scandal.
An iron arm 15 minutes followed before the police, face grim, have blazed a path to elbow blows to their vehicle and parties speed with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, remained behind, his badge White returned to hide his name.
As the female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain a cirée image.
"Sometimes, we are fighting verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of the time, it is the public who starts."
Prosecutors inculperont not Senator Ensign
Prosecutors from the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to an assistant to a former campaign and its efforts to obtain lobbying work for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday the senator's lawyers.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who was seen as a possible candidate Republican in the presidential election in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case makes headlines national last year and undermine his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign said he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Counsel for Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "advised that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain some kind of accusation against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate a criminal prohibition federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of the senator with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of funders policies to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then, he has defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by law to lobby his former employer or the Senate in its entirety.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the case, seems to contradict the ban so-called revolving door lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there is a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate, and substantive violations of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the Justice Department has refused to explain the reasoning which led to the decision in the case Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a certain number of high-level cashed setback by his section of the public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high ranking government officials can now assumes the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received Monday a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice and followed the next day, saying that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a news release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the public prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint independently by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of 96,000 dollars by the parents of Mr. Ensign Hampton violated the federal election law.
The electoral commission has said that it was not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton get lobbying work.
An Email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company had allowed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff to Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelait" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another customer Nevada, Air Allegiant, and he has asked the Secretary of Transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after having hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as leader in the Republican ranks fourth in the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign no longer was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped the Ethics Committee quickly would follow the example of the Department of Justice and would put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The appeal of Cheshire vice-chairmanships to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were in the process of typing away in rows of the courtroom.
They were consigning all minutes of testimony horrific reports via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, largely followed the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the family Cheshire, in Connecticut, should lead to a formal end when the judge would impose the death penalty, voted on by the board.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outline arguments appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years.
This is provocative, it is that the intense media coverage of the trial - as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists of the Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," if widespread and instant saturation with incendiary details that the jury was improperly influenced by the passions of the public.
The demand could push the appellate judges to debate on the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"I have experience at this trial and I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court, laconiquement rejected the claims last week in the judgment, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board would have been animated by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966 landmark, the Supreme Court of the United States quashed the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "the Fugitive."
Some lawyers have said that the appellate courts to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be required to manage the means of communication courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue asserts that some appellate judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instantaneous communication from courtrooms could allow more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is one of many described by counsel for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years, delaying the execution.
The defence lawyers say, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when the Blue judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors showing grisly photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they had been horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years.
The defence lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge had unfairly deported one juror, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case has dominated the media scene in Connecticut and it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They have maintained that the media computer kept fanning the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily tweets scuffle media, cameras and journalists to the courthouse," wrote the lawyers, "not unlike anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on the cover of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the statement, according to which the new instant were more incendiary than news releases handed more slowly, was a luddiste view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of the future trial.
But some lawyers have said that the appeal courts concerned often attracted to the argument that the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Counsel for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their file, they make a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard due to media coverage of the trial and they have indicated that they invoqueraient the need for new rules for the new media.
"This affair," Directorate-General "represents that Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can reconcile the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory time before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders has produced no breakthrough on the key issues that need to be addressed during the "lame duck" session.
But obviously, there are at least had a polite discussion on the differences of the two parties as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode in which each side wanted to score. Empty rating point supporter.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Committee on the president's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and tested mutual for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
This is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of participants unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or rights, the two parties remain miles away.
However, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now on the side of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections have aroused partisan passions and, secondly, they are estomptent.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is an option on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the wealthy, while denying unemployment benefits to workers without jobs.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimism hangs on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But official William Galston put it, of the Brookings Institution, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "blade duck will lead" does not necessarily lead to better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead of this, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once things that need to be made will be, the psychology in the short term will revert to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner has also expressed scepticism widely shared that civility would lead to a genuine cooperation.
"I believe most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow - boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electors present at the tea, which have contributed to its development.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are now clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee on the deficit, which include reforming the tax code and to increase certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reduce spending.
The Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, by themselves, imposed the issue of the deficit on the agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have had difficulty in achieving this number.
The greatest resistance persists among the elected members of the group, which suggests that there is on tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the battles between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come the next year in the form of partisan clashes, given that Republicans are challenging Obama in terms of budget, tax and health care; then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What is the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely shown that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then the two parties will be watching closely the public's reaction.
The one who will be judged loss should change course and find compromises.
But this is nevertheless an optimistic point of view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid 1990s and there seems to be more ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists of the two parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find an accommodation on the issues that divide them again.
The US disclosed documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and put up to the Kremlin part of bribes and money that it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a memorandum in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service realize huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said that.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses, but also of organized crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share while money went toward the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was mailed Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The score is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there has since been few traces of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and it has won several libel trial on these charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV channel, when he was interviewed on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it is to shed, it's anything."
The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report to embassy; and it is incredible to imagine that this would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to appoint a "dysfunctional" and to say that the government was functioning more like a kleptocratie than a government, " according to the memo from the embassy.
"The criminals enjoy a" krysha " (term used in the criminal world/the mafia which means literally" roof " or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, and throughout the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB and the MVD and militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It's an inefficient system in which the criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB breaststroke silver larger companies and that the police target small.
A source, he said that, "explained that business owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime), because not only, they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminals, but they are also protected by law."
"This is the reason for the request for protection by criminal gangs is not as high."
The memo noted that, although the collection of money extended protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to an arrest.
Those who do not pay promptly see their businesses shut down as a pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned several times the fight against corruption but he admitted little progress.
The memo from the embassy sends reports showing men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, up to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" from Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said that corruption is inevitable.
According to INDEM, the costs of corruption would worsen, the whole of Russia, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country has been ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the memo from the US Embassy, which was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, in part, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN Larry King, Putin has hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the remarks that US diplomats had disclosed the appellant Batman and bringing Medvedev Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, important factor in domestic politics in this country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly lit with shoddy concrete walls of poor quality, the director of the Veng Anlong secondary school has talked about the man who had built, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42-years-old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the longstanding loyalty is finally challenged Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to respond publicly to the people who had participated in the scheme.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of his former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, delivered its first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the "Duch."
Before the evolution of the situation, the anxiety increased with veterans of the Khmer Rouge Anlong Veng, complicating the reconciliation efforts and their wishes to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot - United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movements go in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were running guerrilla base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the first democratic elections in the country in 1993, large groups of combatants Khmer Rouge began defecting to the government, culminating with the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most veterans Khmer Rouge have sunk in abject poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite officers Khmer Rouge kept their positions in local leader in exchange for depositing weapons, it is farmers unskilled at low rank and file.
"These people have benefited very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in an environment where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who has joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok is feeding everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs."
The Khmer Rouge tribunal underway has also caused worries here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The mandate of the court is to try senior leaders and the heads of the crimes but he did not say whether he was continuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers from the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers would have found dead.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near its wooden stilt house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the grass parched, Im Chaem refused to discuss its past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had convened, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," d'Addario said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also warned repeatedly that instability would happen if the court was pursuing several suspects; although experts and historians who dispute this.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But confronting the past is everything that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, of the Documentation Centre.
"The Khmer under reconciliation is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "a History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It was distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to textbooks on history of the Department of Education, designed for high schools, which contained fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young Anlong Veng are only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new manual was helping students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the tribunal will continue."
Such resistance has made the complex and difficult process of reconciliation, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the mountain heights of Dangrek, a road, invaded by weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black, covered with a rusted tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31 years, mobile phone vendor roadside, said that she did not know much about the man who has been cremated at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go to pray, she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she had planned to walk towards the final resting place of Pol Pot when she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to waive its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a news release joint published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here on the Foreign Minister of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly-enriched uranium and seemed to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials have said in the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of the weapons-grade uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This has opened the door to an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it has been beneficial to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic in the wake of the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2012 nuclear summit security."
"This proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group of promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant, important" conducted by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide within four years to come.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have been under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the summit on nuclear safety of Obama, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation will never renounce its uranium.
"We kept HEU, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the weapons-grade uranium to low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Lukashenko.
"This is our product... we will not produce dirty bombs, and we will not sell to anyone."
"We will use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus has close US there are a few months; however, showing interest to reach an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus, in October, has been particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It has been loaded on a special train that ran more than 1,300 miles up to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation was completed Monday and was conducted by plane, according to the officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with the LEU; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organisation have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence," leading to the agreement signed by President Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Threat Reduction World.
According to estimates by the Center for Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States are strained over the years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a greater respect for democracy and Human Rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and the development of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has no objection to the CIA flights
The government has no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo direction across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US Ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables by Wikileaks in daily El Pais, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernàndez de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish executive must be informed "pouvoir' demonstrate that they were performing adequate vigilance on foreign planes passing through Spain."
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, held a meeting between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernàndez Vega.
The Vice-President has acknowledged that the report of the Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and stressed the fact that Spain had nothing to hide.
"The Vega said that Spain had no objection regarding intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so that it "takes off guard," says Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the department aims of this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, has reported to the Spanish ambassador that the Executive "wanted to give this matter the looming lowest possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
In turn, in the month of January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González has communicated to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating element, no sensitive information," said the embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States have demonstrated when even their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for CNI o declassified information from the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In the month of March 2007 during a lunch meeting between US Ambassador and the Minister of Internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff "to avoid the comments of a fiery rhetoric, trying to declined temperature."
The ambassador also expressed its concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"In spite of its general orientation pro-American, our experience suggests that PP certainly will benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations are negative consequences for the US Government," points out.

Members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the SGP would lose 9
With the results of 18 - N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last elections autonomous Catalan PP has already covered general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive because the number of votes that this training gets in these comices normally double it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan received 610.473 votes in the general in 2008, while the autonomous, they had obtained 316.222 in 2006.
Sunday past, the CPP has won 384.091 votes.
If it maintains this upward trend, desired a diversion of votes of the SGP and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated the fact that, if there is general elections, the CPP could from 8 to 12 MPs in the Congress, while CiU would also benefit from four (now 10) and CHP would lose neither more nor less than 9 Members (25).
These calcules would notice that the Catalan place is crucial for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while LCI would retain an MP or earning.
But if the election agenda continues, the more next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the municipal comices, where the popular may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relays at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, authorities which manipulates the higher budget - EUR $661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that CSP could lose the Lérida Barcelona town halls, Tarragona, and Gerona, where the Socialists would receive the majority no longer the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and LCI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be deluded that this training loses its representation in the town hall in Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
Lérida, the PP has registered only a difference of 500 votes compared to CSP, including the mayor, Ros Àngel, maintains very good relations with Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
The popular reported progress in other important municipes such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to train rolls in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
The seven inmates at Barcelona in Thailand there were three
Seven Pakistani and the Nigerian held by officers from the police station General Information Police Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that led from Thailand, facilitated Al Qaeda passports to different groups, among which "the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Mumbai attacks that have caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring the fact that with "Operation Kampai" has "been stupidity" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the unit, in the two years during which she has been active in Catalonia, has been sent thousands of passports in Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that leverages the galaxy criminal Al Qaeda for its "combatants" to move the European borders and other Western countries with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadi network was holding operative in Europe, it is for this reason that in the investigations have participated in the Thai services, other police units European, that's why in the territory of the European Union could be days of similar coups than past Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with the Pakistani Junaid, was detained this operation Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad's fellowship and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade, Thailand has conducted another, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Butt Ehsan and Thailand's Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was those who ran from Bangkok cell implanted in Spain and in other European countries.
Catalan network - including a party has been hit in 2009 - the passport was flying mostly tourists who met the conditions marked by the appointed "World Islamic Front."
That is, to say the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of estampées several years and without visas.
The investigators point out that so far has found no detail that connects inmates in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must remember the fact that a few days before that attack, Catalonia was sent through an agency transfers a few miles of dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used by the legislation after the "commando" that killed 106 people.
Police grabbed a literature.
POL application to Mas it suspend tax complicity
The leader of CPP, Alicia Sànchez - Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to expose personally Artur Mas its conditions to support his investiture as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign, which boil down to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo adventures - sovereigntists as is economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to raise half of its mandate.
The Chair of the popular Catalan arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 MEPs in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to be love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will ply the oppositions abstaining in the voting for the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are key Catalan.
And in relation to the president of the PP, to support a nomination "should eliminate all separatist and sovereignists speech," and the complicity economic - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit itself to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make wrenching the political apparatus of an administration autonomic very exaggerated and the elimination of tax on successions and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will share of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas met already with Joaquim Nadal (CSP) - which has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (LCI) and now he will do with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric asserts that the dead had not been due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly
Officials of the geriatric The Caritat Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage done to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly which he was responsible in the meantime that it has worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, came accompanied by counsel for the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the procedural position of civilian officials."
And apart from the discredited social entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a substantial compensation already calculates that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from this day has not ceased to kill.
The judge said in sentencing that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of geriatric care he suspected that in many cases explored no doctor personally died but, given the age and health conditions of patients, the formality was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, denied categorically yesterday this situation and has noted that "the lack of action may have been at any time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only one indication of recklessness by any other person that is not the accused."
The person already named as "the Angel of Death" said Monday 11 murders and explained that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it has caused the death by injecting a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedatives pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control access to the staff of the centre for medicine.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But the laboratory tests will clarify if Vila is not lying by saying that he has sought for its first victims died less cruel or otherwise it has burned inside laundry giving as it has already admitted that he has done with the three women that he was killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, no longer the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of greater than the number and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the shift in the way to kill after committing successfully eight murders.
It is for this reason that they declare that they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacts sharply yesterday to the threat of yesterday Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The incremental peripherals have closed the strength and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of ECB yourself and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a signal anxious.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it collapses, he recovers, but motivated by fencing for short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor take long to lose the fear.
There was a month ago, ECB we cited today to remove liquidity measures and it will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the plan to purchase government debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity to term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that it prolongs the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the auction quarterly access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until the month of June.
We hope that we will continue with the program of buying bonds and that it gives even the signal to intensify.
If they do not do the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they are still blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help!
Even during their meeting in the month of May in which they have said that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they have collapsed markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In the month of May, he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought much, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the auction drafts to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to $750 million to 4.81 percent from the previous auction.
Even so, types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflect a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
Ireland was published figures Allied hole and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to secure private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not have detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the next Tuesday, the government will seek parliamentary approval for his new budget, and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate tone of his speech to relax the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany interpreting Wagner and remains the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president has had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment ring to the gills of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market has suffered the 4.5 per cent, double that the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today there is an auction - key obligation to three years will be organizational development by Trichet, therefore we hope that it would solve with strong demand and help to dispel any doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain to claim a Assistance Plan would be a auto-immolation.
They would deliver a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than $40 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, types very expensive and they cut access indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of the wife Caesar, "seem to be,."
Courage, we can get out!
The president of Eulen will contest the council of Vega Sicilia asked by her sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he believes "there is no law," the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, sought by five of her seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over management of the organs of the incumbent Bodegas firm Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his son Jesus David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a share of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for the companies did not appear to be willing to cede in their dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of her seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, including the dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Community Futures.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrat Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has opened new box of tonnerres within the family Álvarez.
Recourse to the judge for setting the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal seeking his five sons to try, procedural pettifoggery through clearly defrauding the Act and by abusing the law, validate and correct the assembly radically void the January 18," according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting was held, be challenged in considering that it is "zero right."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have tried without success that the magistrate shall call a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage and owner of Bodegas company Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group solicits nevertheless usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the protocols familiar.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of dispute for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull F1 triumph with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull hese entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this distinguished universe of speed has been marked by the surprise and success.
In a first time, no one has taken into account the options for a new barn that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the final stage of the championship they all betting on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lower skill as a pilot of the Champion, the German of goaltender Sebastian Vette, no longer the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to transform them into a team winner.
It really is a powerful simulation software process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far away from the high automobilistique competition.
Appointed, this powerful instrument computer was used to create assembly plants as everyone, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is reproducing, accurately simulate the product or process prior to the construction of a real way, avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
Has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or more famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this instrument computer in his factory Formula 1 led Red Bull to create and perform "in few hours, almost in real time," the amendments, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables in the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team are working now 180 young professionals of high qualifications, equipped with powerful computers analyze and propose any changes to the cars.
The head of Siemens explained that the software is able to analyse and improve all aspects of racing for Red Bull except the engine, which is responsibility of Renault.
It amends the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The change can switch from the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by high-tech laser and autoclaves.
As a single limitation of this madness of technology development, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula One team can spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has introduced high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality to 50 kilometres of London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty account 580 people, these two pilots, the Vettel champion, and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the vast technological resources that the mark of energy drinks is in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero visibility.
The director of technology for the plant, Steve Nevey, says that there are five years you could say that the progress of R & D in the case of cars racing brought the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents the 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15% of the value added.
Nevey admit that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two 1920s own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) was inaugurated in Barcelona its first store exclusive in collaboration with its partner DuPont Reyes.
This will be the first network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for two years.
The company will tally this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand sales dealer centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, vice-president of HP Spain, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Via shopping Barcelona, ownership of Pont Reyes, with which it is 30 years that it works.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implant themselves 200 points of sale of brand in Europe by 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero refused to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores is always the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and handles the design of the exclusive furniture stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive manner), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers personnel training institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claimed "improve service to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, the post sale and even the packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pilot program pioneer at global level that solves the potential problems of HP's computer equipment as collateral.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs users, as the major airlines have already technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on ' voler' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse in margins of interests, that will attempt to partially compensate with increments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell await capture a million customers in three years, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit during the three future years and be able to survive in an economic environment very complicated.
The bank will march in 2011 a new management plan that will be going labilité to three years.
The objective, to survive without need to resort to FROB public subsidies, is to earn a rating of market by harnessing a million new customers - 700,000 if you deducted those who are able to get out of the bank, its major task to accomplish, because so far the bank had marred more small businesses and corporations that the particular customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 customers and 50,000 companies.
His personal market rating is 3.5%, while the companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis for 2011-2013 plan is a gamble on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the goal of cost reduction, including the provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare now to set goals and make public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will complete this year its blueprint Optima, establishes there was four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further year.
Clients who leave escape the coffers of savings will be its main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by FIPA, Guardiola stressed the fact that 2011 will be a year of "difficult and transcendental."
The executive, in fact, believe that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create workstations," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted he says.
And even if he thinks that the war liabilities - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions are paying for its emissions to get liquidity moving already in the price of the credit to offset the drop in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We do not have tight the faucet, but the differentials are highest," acknowledged Guardiola.
BANESTO has already given orders to its network of limiting the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see CincoDías 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The blueprint of Sabadell is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of achieving corporate operations.
This is not in vain that it ensures that Spain "will seek bigger size."
"Everything will happen next year," assured says.
He says that the necessities of capital "increase dramatically" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he noted that the FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalization.
After having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that few banking predict already as a new liquidity crisis.
He noted that we cannot issue, but instead of what happened in June, the short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among unions
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday, has rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and insisted again on the speed with which carries out the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings funds began, there have been several entities which have ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they are reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses savings (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday, has rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that the greater part of mergers has been conducted, we cannot say that the inclusion of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, adjustments."
"Most was done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have been completed already under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, who worked a lot in this operation, too," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of Leaders and single-community Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration happen "to the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it operates within the deadlines that were set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé says.
"The passage of 45 crates with an average of 28.500 million in volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% that they are much larger to comply with Basel," said he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of opinions quite happy about the slowness of the process" that demonstrated "a lack of sérosité and meaning" because "what the Bank of Spain is to remind you that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and he attributed to people who have questioned a "lack of knowledge."
The officer said that given the current economic conditions, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system which has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the greatest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector is well stress tests that ECB was done in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but he sets the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have provoked a government response doble.
On one side, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private agencies for placement or removal of 426 euros in aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the Loteries of the state.
Another, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, unites criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel in regard to its responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How are we to interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its policy communicative.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, which shocked with the question of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits for the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for countries that transgress, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and so long as it is defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission paper deficits, the German Government has invented constitutional reform to prevent from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany believed that we had to do (plans for fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci- includes France, practiced.
The second blow of the central European country was when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the subject of a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expresses once again a clear stance by calling for the reform of the Treaties of the European Union to make possible the rescue of a country and compel simultaneously private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should assist in the process of reform of the Union which should make possible these measures from 2013.
Germany drew a red line that she did not think intersect.
And she tells us all that, even though now we must take measures with which there may not be too agree, from this date there former functioning of the euro would be finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries which contravene the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector also will incur a cost advantage.
Germany says that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who has chaired the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The development is clear.
And it would be wrong not hear.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% by 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what he must do in these circumstances is to fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence leave arrive towards us greater tranquillity.
And what we know to take the opportunity that we have been given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that Mr. Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double reporting (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large companies and the announcement yesterday of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it has opened the way for the thesis that we need to put order in the house.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is there, and they don't seem to move.
And among the possibilities being considered, we cannot exclude that abandon a monetary zone laden with too few serious countries.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that it was warned.
Sport and fraud law
The tricks are similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the desire to escape a sanction.
The expulsion played in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has aroused interest in the sport anti-science nature of such behaviour and if the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before finishing the game (that their team already clearly earned), two players have deliberately lost the time when they have committed mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players make regulatory enforcement during the next game of the match against Auxerre Dam and will pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has punished with two games the team's coach, Jose Mourinho and various are economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, if not quite frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is party ethos, non - written rules, but followed, this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case related to the fact that this has had a team of the entity as player of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays the nobility and honor and which in past occasions has fined his players for similar acts) and to the drama orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode of more history inflated histrionique technician and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behaviour not banned explicitly by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions it is committing a fraud law, because, in effect, they are environmentally-friendly actions with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
A property that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, something that these actions did not endanger, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of those assets to which it refers to the proper game is preventing the team players offenders enjoys an unfair way contrary to the team, which is not the case either.
However, the action of the players of Real Madrid paradoxical fact is that it does not adapt to what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud law, because its violation of the rules had not been conducted in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has specifically attempted to be the most obvious possible to receive the penalisation of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get errors well-intentioned examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that it is not in a situation of disadvantage to rival it obtains an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action involves letting their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of ambiguity, because the team could be eliminated at once and that, with this action the players are doing a match penalty and spend in the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cardboard occurs with a less than in the first round.
So, climb the ladder, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit from what the rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud the law), m otherwise they chose instead the moment in which they are subjected to it.
They have taken a strategic decision without defeat the penalty or flee from this one.
Even if the border between genius and fraud law is diffuse, on this occasion I think that there was a clear case of genius.
The controversy appears, it seems, because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way to send the director to provoke.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offered offensive to capture the Christmas dinners for groups by NCBs
The dictatorship of the timetable is concentrating this year a spate of bookings on days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 Euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, when December arrives return also dinner before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have lead in an offensive te prices adjusted to be able to capture the customer majority: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros dinners or lunches, coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To complete complicate the accounting, the timing of this year (such as the night of New Year's Eve falls Friday) has concentrated applications in the week of 13 December, resulting up to now a spate of bookings of dinners for days peak (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize paying their own pockets.
Whatever the conditions, they are asking all price battle, confirms the Gremi president of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs Restauració.
The representative of the employer, at present, do not dare to predict how will the holidays this month.
"People all thought a lot before booking."
"They want to get out but they pay much attention to the price," he says.
The matter will go well "for those who provide quality at good prices and with a good service," he adds, and recalls that customers have a tendency to descend a level with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros became majority in the application.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre has been identified is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is a genuine boom in applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by tailoring their menus to the economic situation, with complete forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of more powerful, Andilana, with 16 institutions in the city (Hostal Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the timetable has assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of the month of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices in the past year, with menus for all tastes of $19.95 to 30 euros," detail they.
Grup year, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local, remains optimistic after having detected a billing growth since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for the Christmas.
Sources from the group noted that the 18 will also be a hyper active in terms of groups of friends who are celebrating in advance the holiday season.
In their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wines made in the champagne method - ' cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite new employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
The share of employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment), its vice-president, Enric Gomà says in the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "lively," even if customers "negotiate to the maximum."
This is true, the hope as regards the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern to the US
Islamabad product of atomic weapons in "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of United States filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
Aside from the insightful and tasty details available on the content of the conversations and thoughts of diplomatic representatives North American accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "QUINTILES" and that the unstable Asiatic country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make it difficult to destroy them in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
As the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials with rumour and the vulnerability of the transportation of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and in the missile programs are considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has the staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline of cultural and educational levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who worked in the nuclear and missile programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Ministry of Externes during a meeting with American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is cooperation increasingly reduced between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level Pakistani production of nuclear armas.
A telegram from the Embassy in May, which describes as as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also request to Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, whether understand "very clearly" in charge "the Army of Pakistan must finish with tacit support for terrorist groups."
The hunting of head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for the fight against terrorism to prevent new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to monitor the movements and locate Assange.
All the aspects linked to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a traditional order of arrest.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise he datte of 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with filtration last more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the creator of Wikileaks lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The 20 police international headquarters in Lyon (France) has driven the demand of Sweden, but it has not made public until very yesterday, having received permission from the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received indication to identify or locate Assange "for his provisional arrest and his extradition."
Although Interpol may not give the order to arrest a person affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a way for the arrest - - that the national police corps must achieve, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is thought that Assange is.
The movement has outraged lawyers to Assange, who yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39, has shown by video conference to answer questions from Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has sought and obtained a permit to get out of Sweden by the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"This appears to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world seeks - and his mother in Australia defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be found in an unknown location, but it is not silent.
On Monday he gave from an undetermined location an interview with the Director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they épient to the UN by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" demand for resignation.
"I am not entirely sure why the opinion of a guy with a Web page should interest us," said he said to CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a high head of counter-terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The trial of the spokesman for President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, Congressman from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the State Department that he is studying the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate his funds and pursue anyone who provided contributions or assistance."
Went further Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who was back on its statements after having said that Assange will "be murdered."
"Obama should transform the goal and use an unmanned aircraft, or something similar."
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"The one who is in the Government which has filtered information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," said he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace with winks at the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for resolving the internal revolt umpteenth inside CRAs, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted that the liar and that it cannot give him headaches he had with other common extinguished.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will earn his new criticism with winks eye allowing shield up to municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national RCT advisers will decide on its continuity in secret.
The ballot papers, not in your hand.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote of criminalising the president, they can do without any fear retaliation.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and the date of submission to his person.
In several interviews that he would not be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, as a result "for the Bulgarian" would not be right either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than put its position to provision of the militancy, a gesture that is not true when Puigcercós monitoring body maxim between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to accredit with the executive a road map until the month of May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of strategic reorientation of the paper that management will submit to the casting of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of it to plan the congress in the fall of 2011, what the rulers regard as a fact sure.
The ERC leader has admitted that "many" affects the stability and that its goal is to do that once and for all the organization is able to wash his clothes in the family room.
In this line, the article that the current councillor Josep Huguet signed in his blog result is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if had done.
And he has listed five, which he stressed two.
The first, "reshape" the executive for it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures come from the fan of Carod.
The second may be the character of big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes allowing the achievement of the congress through delegates elected by universal suffrage.
Finish with the model assembly, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has battled already in this direction in the last two Congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 has instructed management to revise the model assembly in a special congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished because the internal tide of recent years recommended not addressing this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good for the resume and the close forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of this country in the COP16 assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce up to 2020 between 40 and 45% of greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to cut between 40 and 45% of greenhouse gas emissions before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of this country to the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16è Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention United Nations Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, explained to me, the last four years his country has inverti $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, it has clearly stated that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He said that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; building capacity; construction of institutions and support for pilot programs.
It has recorded progress in all these areas, ci- includes the approval, the last year, a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives discussed in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases, explained to me.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the government and local to achieve the objectives of saving energy, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, said to me, there are various multi-annual plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government as by the governments of other countries.
For example, has mentioned to me, the Program for Energy Efficient Organization Use, which has been implemented during the last five years and which has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, another for change incandescent lamps with energy-efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, has detailed says.
At the same table, Martin Krol, advisor of the government of this country in relation to climate change, has ensured that China's efforts have been larger what we believe.
For example, explained to me, the emission per capita of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historic contribution to the contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar to 2020, said he said.
Espino legal deportation: Caesar Nava
The PAN national leader has detailed that the former paniste leader has the right to speak to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
The PAN national leader, Caesar Nava Vàzquez has ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former paniste leader has the right to speak to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
In the interview prior to the protest Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission Order of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to speak, when applicable, making a claim to the Commission Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the midst of a competent organ," noted says.
On the other hand, he was informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vàzquez was convinced of the fact that Acción Nacional would be stronger after internal elections for the next 4 and 5 December where we should elect a successor.
"It (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, this has been an approach for the local elections which has been successful and has achieved its objective," said he said.
The paniste leader said that NPA is supported by 71 years of dialogue, why "we do not fear internal competition; on the contrary" we relish and we made stronger, " said he said.
He said that perhaps the council will know élégir/the best leader/e whose Acción Nacional needed for the next three years, so it would give the notes "to the person determined by the board."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five."
It was anticipated that the recovery experienced by the party in the elections of July 4, will be thinking about the next row, even if "this is not the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it comes to accompany the governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for compliance across the country, so that it has been "a lot of hopes, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of the expectations."
When we asked about the PRI criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked priistes to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari administrations.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo Salinas were better than those of Fox, Calderon; that they begin to defend; they emerge from" cabinet, " he said.
He said that the holder of federal executive can make expressions like the ones he did in his speech in the National audience, because there is no gag in the country, and even fewer of censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law in favour of undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, is quiet senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté the US president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today to national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, is quiet senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains opened a cyber relationship with a more detailed document which asks the public to immediately contact the senators, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote" hopefully soon, now is the time to listen to your voice, " he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of tax cuts to the era of Bush and the government funding continue.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confidant that once the tax problem is resolved we can set a agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday it would seek a "vote of closure of the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be the next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the Act of the American dreaming normalizes 800 thousand young people who have arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years, they remained in the country the past five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, in moments of partisan political organizations project's intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority which supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for this reason that supporters of the Dream Act require the votes of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans there are Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator outgoing George Lemieux, Florida, who has completed the mandate known Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they would not support in another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported John McCain, has not defined its position until now.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest obstacles for the Dream Act in the Senate.
With the literature it puts his finger on the wound
The second stage of the language was a walk in which participants flaunted the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? Hopes of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for another show the roundtable was dedicated to the Sex in the language, said she says).
The finger on the wound ..." we puts in embarrassment" gently, launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (BLE) to listen to this table moderate by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who is seeking what is the "wound," she is going to a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative line.
The infectious diseases it fate convinced: "Patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologue cut the breath in the middle of the aisle, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst reveals the mystery: "The wound is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "The wound I have only been able to know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be very interconnected.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a lovely narrative that he titled Praise invention, where the finger on the wound is not nombré but at a time is discovered.
With overtones of magical realism, it speaks of a famous ensorceleuse who was receiving clouds, was to return people who had gone away or fixing the virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the big news that has had its own columnists early and Laurie Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the conquerors capitans narratives.
"Cervantes we invented all (writers) derided antismoking false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre way you never would have conté the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the modesty."
Nevertheless, stressed he says, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction reached its peak.
This is called for is a " tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that it is the tale."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its roundtable The must on the wound.
The Cubaine - Puerto Rican puts hers on the great scourge of social violence that his country is going through - and Latin America share - product fudges disputes and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, poetry sound good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not obviously premeditated," said she said, after citing that the reality of the literature is the communication and the size of the commitment that is established between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero stressed "this should on the wound of the writer committed."
It found that in a world that lives in high speed also in relation to the intellectual habits and control consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every assertion there is a small and behind each deny there is a small yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and be masters of reality, we must temper: and nuance means a lot of time to put his finger on the wound and disturb the people who feel very convenient thinking caricature, in black and white, ideas established and without nuance and disturb also powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recapture the sense of writing.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
"Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to achieve three times the decisive set.
With the duel of Santos Laguna, Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles competing, marked by their technicians, who find a sharp contrast between them by the results.
"Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not put in the mile and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine eventually console themselves with the medal of Deputy champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The santiste strategist came to her first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he was holding the reins of Morelia with which it has lost with an overall score of 4 - 2 against; later, in the 2003 Close as he arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with an overall score of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 200th Anniversary Tournament, again against the Diablos," Rubén has suffered another setback, because his team has done an equal match 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in a series of penalties it has obtained an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to win the title and eventually three of its players have missed 11 metres and he suffered jumping on the outcome of 4 - 3.
"Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he tries to break the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break no statistics, this is a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I have mentioned before is more important," said helmsman when asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers a lot of the last final, in which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the single lesson can be learned is that until the referee whistles is not the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which is not concerned, because it entrusts his players: "You never seeks to achieve a series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we that we prepare for the tournament earlier we were prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a wrong turn, sometimes are the emotions or the anguish of holding the title between our hands, hands we escaped, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that we can no longer in this situation."
Romano has now the opportunity to no longer be a technician deputy champion and taste the glory afforded by the titles for the first time.

Tourism entrepreneurs regretted the accident tourist foreign because of poor conditions of the roundabout Sànchez Taboada to Mazatlàn.
After dark on a foreign tourist in a hollow circle Sànchez Taboada, the Mazatlàn tourist industry has asked the authorities that they focus areas and sites that are in poor conditions and projected a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants Zona Dorada, recalled that they have several times requested that the image of the destination is neat, and new activities must replace other tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to stroll and they see the disorder and avoid the stores close.
"Politicians don't know that means closing a business one day and they don't know the fortune that you lose, they also did not work for so long and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sànchez said that the fall of the tourist exposes the lack of prevention and maintenance of the City Hall.
"The municipium will have to shoulder its responsibility and prevent this happening again, how to do so through a preventative maintenance and will only make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of the fact that this is a tourist area should be nurturing, but as people who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito Mazatlàn.
"Today, because the tourist should come, this does not depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city which has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, ongoing maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"It is not their lent the attention it should and this type of facts pointed out something that is well known to all, maintenance is necessary."

He spoke of a series of places that must be put online together with the municipium and be a priority for the city, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it has a tourist.
"Fortunately Mazatlàn offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and locations that we should order first, clean up and get in line to be attractive to be able to add to the inventory that we have to make the promotion of the destination."

The list of expectations that the new Congress government legislation is a clean management and engaged with society and different sectors that need a responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dàvalos, president of CCE, has proposed that MPs assume great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations which confronts.
"We hope that MEPs exercise really right, free of agreements between the parties since the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into masquerade carnival of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
This is why I request that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that are the current Gouvernant progress.

14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in Estrie, Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, predominantly in places that would have been used in the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that were used in the production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Surete du Quebec.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two leaders alleged this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear in court on Sherbrooke in the hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of doing the trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place in the wake of a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is the information received from the public which allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the regional investigation module of the Eastern Townships of the Sûreté du Québec, Service de police de Sherbrooke and Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this operation.
Illegal migration will continue without any problem
The bill conservatives who, according to the government, should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants will obviously be defeated when the three opposition parties have indicated Wednesday that they could not support.
"I am strongly supports the Charter."
"I stand with a party that has created the granite beneath your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by deputies after the holding of the weekly caucus meeting.
The liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to a year anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, then we shall see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NDP in immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism from the other side of the hand that his party is not sufficiently strong on illegal immigrants.
"The NDP agreed that we take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill because it takes the Conservatives to refugees and imprisoning children for at least a year," said Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians overwhelmingly say to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect that Canada take firm measures," responded the Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could lead the country to elections in the event its rejection.
A Conservative told QMI Agency has, however, that the government would seek a vote so that each MP who oppose then explains to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public committee of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this matter as early as January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement on Tuesday has surprised many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services in Quebec, on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
He never needed more than the péquiste criticism in public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, describes as the announcement of "rabbit signed out of a hat" and "bricolée solution on the corner of a table."
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the result when we will announce, merely to say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this committee of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, it suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate for the Auditor General to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," 15-25-year-olds says.
It considers equally that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing it to compel people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would seek also to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request comes from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews, meanwhile confirmed that his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently studying some amendments relating to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, who hit the motorcycle groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently passed the Law on gangsterism.

Dupont partially blamé
The radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and the Haitian people and his on-air foul language.
The CBSC judge that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, representations unduly negative Haitians and swearing is not suitable for broadcast during the day."
The Council has also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the release of the names of two people who had killed themselves, have not breached the codes on broadcasting.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front social assisted people in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the program were inaccurate.
Facilitators should present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding the suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had estimated that suicide is a gesture of cowardly.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes implicated" Dupont lunch "have touched on a sensitive topic of fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was selected in his place.
The latest dispute focused on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media confrontation which had attracted a lot of reactions.
The facilitator of CHOI said that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people really would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is a representation unduly negative Haitians.
"I've already served my suspension three days on that."
"My file is blank for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM worked "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among others, announce these decisions once during prime time within a period of three days.
A king of Montreal kung-fu
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular route.
The athlete who excelled in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in Thai kickboxing and boxing climbs on the tatamis and the rings in the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing there are 12 years old, Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I am seeking fighting everywhere, because for those who dislike the game on the ground now in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the company UPS has rightly issued bad news for its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to October 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and boxing Thai, Davutoglu said."
"Currently, I am preparing to move into China for the World Cup of san shou."
"The fighters who have finished among the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I have concluded the tournament ranked fifth, while I got third in Toronto in 2009, said."
"What is interesting is that I have made progress in each competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time around or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where the kicks and punches, and projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels are held initially on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The pugiliste most renowned resulting from this form of battle is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung The well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to retain a single event in his career, he will answer surely his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This is the most 96,014 and most prestigious competition in China, explained the sympathetic forecastle."
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stage of Thailand)."
"It was an awesome experience."
Zemmal won his first battle in the semi final of his category (80 kilograms), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated was a true pro, has it analysed."
"There are four veterans by category (80 kilograms, 85 kilograms, 90 kilograms and 90 kilograms)."
"The semi-final winners in the final clash of their class."
"Then, the winners of each category face to crown a single champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has granted willing-seller $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain hydro-electric project -1- A- Sarcelle - Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Montreal-based Axor who won the most important, that of stewardship of the project, for a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was formed in 2004 to correspond to the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust private its responsibility to manage this important hydro project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium here won the lucrative contract without there having been public tendering.
For the Parti Quebecois, recourse to consortia of firms poses a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and lead to a rise in prices.
"This is the new way of doing the collusion and slaughter of competition."
"This means that the people, instead of doing so secret, now do it openly," said yesterday the PQ Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard has raised the issue at the National Assembly because he told hard to see how the public interest can be used this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denied that there was collusion for this contract.
"I began to have my trip," she pesté, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "failed rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortia formula is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to consolidate their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The project involves a high level of complexity given the magnitude of the work.
The site is underway and properly until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition should act; there had been negotiations.
Also, consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in engineering consultant is being investigated in the government.
A quick overview of the business register Quebec helps to count more than 200 consortia, including some seem permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA +, 5.1.2, SNC Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single corporation, Dessau.
As regards the consortium Energy Stewardship Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay Territory responds to specific dynamic workforce and that Hydro-Québec responds differently since the 1970s."
The big boss project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, the Société d'énergie de la Baie-James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which has frowned on the fact that the project management contract has been awarded willing-seller basis.
"If you tender and there are few bidders, your price will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take people who are in that market and that you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy stewardship is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec/SEBJ for the Eastmain A- Sarcelle - Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir scored 109 engineering consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin garnered 22 contracts, 5.1.2 scored 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting his involvement in Energy stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They add up to 449 783 $344, including the contract to Energy stewardship of 295,131,564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Montreal-based Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Nathalie Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms "fund," prior to clarify that it was rather of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - the label "green" does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer Quebec made very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also fair marks and écologisantes certifications to guide its choice.
Worse, even if it is immersed in a media universe where the messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, it regretted a lack of credible information deficiency as even brake to its commitment, says the Barometer responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies like green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the EUMC responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed on the so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of the products and brands posting as eco-friendly, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
The information in the field of responsible consumption seems paramount to stimulate this chunk of consumption currently facilitated by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient the ardour of 46% of consumers.
It is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher prices for these products.
Moreover, a third of Quebecers say they are also wary of the alleged performance green products or services that are seeking to put their hands.
On another note, consumers have been nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed brand or several products to meet their conviction.
Up to 61%, they have also fostered purchases from merchants in their neighbourhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 this year - Homo consumus Quebec likes present themselves as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by concern for the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside of his car, shows the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated using public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their interests green.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1 percent of the participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A loan from the state for the redemption of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to commit financially in the redemption of the complex of cinema eXcentris by Angus Society and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but up to a loan only.
Angus Development Corporation and the Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to redeem Daniel Langlois complex film eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent restore its full cinéphilique vocation, do not get what they asked for.
The government accepts to be involved in the case, but to its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government proposes a loan whose amount would be below initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous conditions, at least in the view of the sources of the headquarters of the state.
A first Action Plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan have been sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilot the record of eXcentris.
He sent a final report there are a dozen days.
But the counterproposal cabinet came to the stand Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the assumption of the donation of the State should have to really be ruled out.
Recall that the Association of Quebec cinemas and cinéparcs owners opposed to a direct investment of the state to support the buyout of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not finance real estate projects, what it has not done for other movie theatres.
But several players in the middle were demanding instead a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of bears, has for 10 years brought to end arms copyright film in its premises of the complex after having financed itself its construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting at Montreal, and eXcentris was able to build customer loyalty.
The Société Angus and Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, 23, from their side, a private fundraising campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring 2009, only one of three screens, The Parallèle, continues to distribute films in eXcentris.
The purpose of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February projecting the beautiful film Xavier Beauvois men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini not recalled Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group believe proposals to lower them.
The veil lifted on a complexé...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States consider the complex of inferiority of Canadians toward the Americans, but they betray the same token the sense of superiority of them to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector was not the Canada-U.S. relationship in mind when voting and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to get its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington over the plaza yesterday, offer more details croustillants that of the substantive content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in full federal election campaign, recounts how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the US ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"Canadian sense of inferiority almost inherent sways perhaps the political leaders to talk about domestic issues of daily life rather than to focus this election on the United States (as during the campaign on the free exchange of 1988)," he wrote.
The United States are therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk."
Ambassador understands even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
Another expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing for President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being toppled by the coalition and the opposition parties made agreement conditional survival to the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from the increasingly negative image that drama broadcast on CBC refer the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No Fly List" or abductions for interrogation by the CIA.
Another cable recounts that, at their first meeting bilaterally, Hillary Clinton has asked his counterpart Bernard Kouchner French if Europe was prepared to welcome some prisoners of Guantànamo.
Mr. Kouchner has answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, written in, "he presented a paper to the secretary of state in respect of Omar Khadr, a Muslim from 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
We note finally that sometimes became emotional on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC that the head of the massive leak should be "murdered."
He echoed the view of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The UN has proposed yesterday in Cancún a renovation plan domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which represents almost one-third of the additional reduction the need to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of large concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs, or better, bulbs to light-emitting diodes (LED or "DEL" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate the humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to pass the overall GHG emissions from 53 to 49 gigatonnes gigatonnes.
Subtract this balance sheet but it will take 5 gigatonnes to stabilize by 2020 climate rising to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid becoming out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs for LEDs, reduces the need for energy of two again.
The bulbs last for an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new lamps to LED, like those that launched the manufacturer Philips this week - the company has participated in the study of the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than a smouldering bulb, which gives an idea of the economy as possible with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to emit very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts had reservations about the location of bulbs because they contain mercury, and that it must eliminate as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers implement instructions.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the indicated energy bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast awaits in nervousness the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, called for the release "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines set.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay, said a spokesman of the head of the UN."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of midnight Wednesday without publishing results, three days after the election Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the chairman of the CIS had said on television that the Committee "continued work" to announce the results.
Calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world that the CIS finally proclaimed the winner of the second-round runoff between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and opposition politician Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council "fraudulent" voting in the north, held by the former rebel New Forces (FN) since the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, has said that intimidation practised by the FN voters in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president to go vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are selected by the Constitutional Council.
Yet opponents of Gbagbo felt that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, northern man who denies any link with the former rebels, has deemed "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that complaint before the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election Sunday, was expected to top the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country remained split into two for years.
The UN warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that she could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had topped the first round on October 31, with 38 percent of votes against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in mainland France (9.7% in counting the overseas departments), show the data corrected for seasonal variations (CVS) interim published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is estimated at 2,631 million in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the workforce in mainland France and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
A year ago, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available in two weeks to work and whether or not a job.
The situation of young people present on the labour market have worsened, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, brought to 24.2% in mainland France (+ 0.9 point about three months, 0.5 point for one-year) and 25% by including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Senior citizens have been for a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in mainland France (+ 0.2 points over three months and a year), or 482,000 people 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the overseas departments.
Only those 25-49 have benefited from a stable unemployment rate in the third quarter, to 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 percentage point in three months, 0.1 point in a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE no longer releases monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues in contrast to do so and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexander Guérini, 53 years, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the President PS board Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and Fresh Arrest at the house arrest of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexander Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social goods, diversion of public funds and property, concealment, bribery, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is aggressive and wants to explain himself on all the issues that the judge will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to continue for a multitude of heads reprehensible, it is another thing to prove," said AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the SP in the département, Jean-Noël Guérini, held by the intermediary of its lawyers, to convey to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been indicted Wednesday evening and Fresh Arrest.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never been anything other than run landfills that he had to manage.
Regarding the awarding of contracts or destination of funds related to their operation, he never had knowledge, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the services of the agglomeration of g n, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition of meeting the protagonists of the file.
"My client was able to provide explanations for the facts attributed to them."
"The judge has taken into account in not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been indicted and release into the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Director General of the cleanliness of Marseilles Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence peddling and corruption."
Two officials of the agglomeration of g n, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "evasion and embezzlement of public property by a person responsible for a public service mission," the other for "complicity of embezzlement of public funds."
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been placed in review for "concealment of abuse of social goods."
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini Figure Stéphane Brunengo - Girard, Fresh Arrest recently in a parallel case of fraudulent procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect that his companies have been used to launder money from the gangsters.
The survey is conducted within the framework of several criminal investigations opened against X in April 2009 in the wake of anonymous e-mails, for alleged fraud in the awarding of public contracts, especially in the waste stream.
Source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of attribution and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste g n and some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young researcher French arrested in Iran for "spying," was held in suspense opinion in France, put on alert diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained his strategy for the Americans, up to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had to return the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by US justice for smuggling of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place them under a bright light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is titled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases."
The advisor to the Elysée Palace for strategic affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talking with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do as much to repatriate their nationals selected force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "martelez ever" in the media the words "human rights basic," "innocence," "immediate release."
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Let all the more that the Iranians want you to do so."
Because past attempts to discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve" the Iranians are "masters in troublemaking."
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian familiar tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (who will be speaking on 16 August, when she sought refuge at the Embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians for a large sum of money" (230,000 euros bail).
And he said that the Élysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon which "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another some 1,800 live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, including the US call for extradition for an illegal traffic in electronic sensitive material to Iran, is released in Paris, on decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, as many observers, questioned this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the clandestine networks Iran's acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France did it accepted a trade-off?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he said, has not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There has been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the custody of the seals (" at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French cannot go back on the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the " monitoring of the French intelligence services.
The advisor to the Elysée composed a telephone number, links, and then informed the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée makes every effort, through releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to suggest that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator."
Americans observe this activity without irony, and find that the handling is bearing fruit as several press articles Chalfant the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the" blitz' media official French ."
What draws so many "gratitude" expressed to Assad, asking the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then examines the reasons which prompted the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," analysis says.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeservedly criminalised."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria which praises it can draw in playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US Embassy knows good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier gave him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have let go anyway."
"It should at least confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss is returning in France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy has received at the Elysée Palace.
In a news release, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cinderella" law which will ban teenagers from playing games online after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to these games after midnight, youth aged less than 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"A lot of children play in these games all night and then have difficulties to study at school and to have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this legislation is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6am.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law is clarified.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time for daily access to these games for young people whose parents request, said the person responsible.
It will also provide people who are demanding free software that can be used to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the newspapers regularly cover the various facts related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, faced with 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizers countries
The turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of FIFA designates Thursday organizers country World Cups 2018 and 2022, an intensely political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying are likely to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 competition Queen FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands - Belgium).
The issue of 2022 will be much more exotic, the Fédération Internationale hoping conquer new territories, Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities as part of delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William Sound, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides a measure of political and economic issues.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of the Championship, English records, Spanish - Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will weigh not very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, birthplace of football that has hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC has presented a layer, Monday, releasing a documentary that pinpoints three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What upset FIFA and embarrassment to French officials, which embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The Head of Government hopes reissue the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005, the organisation of the Olympic Games for London 2012.
This intense activity be enough to refurbish the escutcheon of England with the EC?
Nothing is less secure because the duo Spain - Portugal is not without assets with its stadiums ready, his expertise (Mondial - 82 in Spain, OJ -92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only raise the rating of Russia, become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of his record (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to not make the trip to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in an allusion to thinly veiled accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"It covers mud, trying to compromise," Mr. Putin was launched.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, are emerging as the logical favourites.
First global economic power, seat of the major sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a length ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have built separately a beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries cohosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World - 2026 to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would make obsolete made Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, which was lifted from the great game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new lands, but these two countries have more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of paid TV rights (because of the time difference) by the European countries, the sinews of war to FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand did believe that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than them.
A mandate to the Elysée Palace is another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then as if the doubt still existed.
In a sense, as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that it would take its decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011."
It evokes before UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday night at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" therefore caused a bit of excitement.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far away.
The president was merely point out that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of quinquennats.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that it refers to the presidential election, on the tone of humour at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you have again for seven years and a half with me," he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: ' Do not believe that I do not think about the stage after."
His remarks the day before not more candidate than the day before; they do not make it less.
If they are causing comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy.
But it is not competing entry of Segolene Royal leads Sarkozy to unveil.
It is rather because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an earlier than planned in order of battle.
The bad polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the nomination of François Fillon to that of French President Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA - the Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously reacted the entourage of Prime Minister.
"If he believes the defeat as possible, it will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"There will always be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of securities of State
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year should be the opportunity to clarify the exit terms, or at least, to announce the arrest of many unconventional operations of monetary policy which must be achèver at the end of the year.
Crisis in European sovereign debt requires, the Frankfurt emission institute could not afford to be as compelling subject to exacerbate a situation more tense today on the bond markets across Europe.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, and praised the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the states' debt crisis in Europe.
She did not say if she believed that the central bank should do more, increasing for example its sovereign bond purchasing program.
"I reserve my thinking to my European partners (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the ECB's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown more disert about his intentions, but merely to indicate that the program to purchase of state securities on the secondary market "progressed" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB have doubled the last week, at nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Portuguese and Irish titles, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, expectations of continued purchases without doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a significant change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter still conducts allowances unlimited liquidity on generous terms for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that this device is extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it alters significantly its program."
"Otherwise this would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short-term," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter 2011 seems more likely," " anticipates meanwhile Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the market for government debt, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to animate a sluggish market," added Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the Institute of issuance has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"It would be a substitute for the lack of investors on the market and act so as to prevent a runaway yields paid by the most fragile states," reflected an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are soaring, states will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
The preservation of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is riding
After an early week worrying for Italy, the situation has somewhat relaxed, yesterday, with the decline in long-term bond rates to 10 years.
A return to calm precarious.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of region said they had heard Giulio Tremonti described as the "indecipherable" situation and expect a weekend "unpredictable," which he then denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached a record high of 210 basis points and the price of hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in a certain frenzy in Rome.
Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rates were more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, was "strongly concerned" by "the turbulence of the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third largest economy in the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and weak tax revenues that goes with the risk to the state no longer be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate table on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will represent still 4.3% of GDP next year (vs. 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumours of a new collective budget that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, nor on the short or the long term, because in spite of its significant debt ($119.2% of GDP in 2011, acknowledged Chancellor Schüssel's notion), the stabilization efforts in Italy are lower than those sought by other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held late March.
Then would open a period unconducive to decisionmaking in cases of serious crisis.
Europeans can reflect the strengthening of the anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde stressed again yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have still demonstrated Sunday in the day and into the night, obviously is in solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currencies and their monetary zone."
Although relative detente registered yesterday on the rates of European state bonds has provided grist for governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target more concerned today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," believe the economists Exane BNP Paribas.
Even more than "political time is much slower than the time of the markets."
Aware of this hiatus and dangers that it holds, the European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers from the G20 are going well.
And in view also of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the eurozone in the firing line markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore an Asian tour to educate investors extrême-orientaux developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly is preparing the ground.
The first debt of the EFSF are planned next month.
Yesterday, a US official has told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
The countries that are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are added to the nearest austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a path different from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both take at any price to avoid asking for international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrective action and decide the necessary structural reforms durably to restore confidence.
European funders, finally, talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
Mark in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced the idea that if the?750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the EU would not hesitate to call the hand to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a premier player in the market for European sovereign debt, saw an increase of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle is there: it is the European Stabilization Mechanism financial with, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being examined closely in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions worsening.
Snow and ice storm: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and are likely to disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, d'Eure-et-Loir, Les Deux-Sèvres and Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, flurries supported affect the north of the Gironde and Charentes and snowing weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, selectively from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente and Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor Finisterre, Gironde, Dordogne region of Poitou and those of Basse-Normandie regions, Île-de-France and Limousin.
The snowy episodes are sufficiently significant to generate traffic problems and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo-France.
On the Côtes d'Armor, several départementales have been banned to heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including axes C-355/90.43 - Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult, according to the gendarmes who recommend not take his vehicle in case of necessity and the movement of certain TER coach has been suspended for the day.
School transport has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
There was no specific measure Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "calls on all motorists to caution on the roads and to adjust their conduct accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel Thursday 25 percent of their flights at Paris airport Roissy and 10% at Orly because of snow ahead.
The DGAC recommends for air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, the Gatwick airport, south of London, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first sketches financial
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Île-de-France is in full swing, the inner billion.
In the discussion of less.
It evokes especially $23 billion for the metro Grand Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical, it is this sum that will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets a portion of the funding of his double loop.
Today, it has finally arrived to the first additions.
The law on finances 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains devices to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the establishment of a special tax on equipment and a tax increase on the Ile-deFrance offices.
The first, says in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Society of Greater Paris."
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is $117 million euros per year."
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices which exists "to modernize, improve the product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
This would report how much?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these resources tax are added to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment that will be mobilized by the state and made to the Société du Grand Paris progresses and the project," reads in the explanatory statement.
The GSP, we do not find this shocking system.
"From the moment when we created (the two taxes, revenue growth), we can cover the studies on three years and then typing in the 4 billion after it was suggested."
"This will be included in the budget and fired it as."
The GSP estimated that 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which 4 billion promised are still subscribers, risks provoking a parliamentary discussion a little agitated.
First public session on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and spies diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal before the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
The other, it announces changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression.
But let us proceed.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is confirmation of the fact that each case constituted by a secret service (of whatever nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" revelations US on sexual habits of Berlusconi only bring back what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the profile eerily caricature of Gaddafi was long for artists for cabaret skit.
The rule according to which the secret files should be compounds that new already known is essential to the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a bookstore in esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templiers or Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And not only because the author of occult texts do not like to do innovative research (and does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the alchemy does not believe that what they know, and reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy (or spirit limited) the head of the secret services (otherwise it might be, whatever, editor of Libération), which is as true that what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek magazine ran the week before.
So why the revelations on these issues have so much noise?
On one hand, they say that anyone who cultivated is already known, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises representation, turned into centres of espionage.
Any investigative film viewer knows this, and it is only by hypocrisy that are pretending to ignore.
However, the fact of repeating publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country deals a significant blow to the prestige of the Department of State.
As the scandal is not in crisis victims that "executioners."
But let us move on to the very nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, at the time of Orwell, it could design all power as a Big Brother, which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely proven since, that can monitor each movement through the phone, every transaction, visited the hotel, the highway traveled and so forth, the citizen became the victim total eye of power.
But when it shows, as it happens now, that even the crypts secrets of power cannot escape the scrutiny, the report control ceases to be a hacker unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as vengeful citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets can take?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secret is an empty (and secrecy vacuum will never be disclosed); it is true, too, that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a vacuum of secrecy, because public; but revealing, as did WikiLeaks, Secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means removing any power.
While WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states can no longer put on-line information reserved - this would be tantamount to publish on a poster pasted down the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technology, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state has moved aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future the reserved and private reports?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is part of science fiction and is therefore novels, but I am obliged to imagine the government officials who move discreetly in stagecoaches uncontrollable routes, being carriers that messages learned by heart, or at most, by hiding the scarce information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in drawers locked: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now advance crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-established a telegraph wire (telephone).
The video (analog) had allowed researchers film to explore a movie not going forwards and backwards and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, whereas now CDs (digital) do that to jump to chapter by chapter, i.e. macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we are going to Rome to Milan in three hours, then that plane, and travel as it includes, it takes three hours and a half.
It is not extraordinary that the policy and communications technologies in return for cars horse.
A final observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what went on in the secrecy of the embassies.
At present, embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France bidouille its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the honouring promises of funding quickly released (so-called " fast start financing or early) made by the developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages were.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries have pledged to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU was lifted from the game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment regarding the fast start financing: report detailing the actions of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of leaflets...
Operation transparency is appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with a similar level of precision.
The EU announcement have reached in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which puts on the right path to respect its commitment to $7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money should be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states including France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference which suits him best.
The European Commission has for example considered reference year 2009: the international funding are maintained, and adds $150 million over three years under the " fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of ODA.
In contrast, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In practical terms, the total amount of the support of France for developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), she contends its commitment in terms of "new and additional funding..."
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1 € lent equivalent to 1 minutes.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are cost-effective (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that we will recover as equivalent to a euro that we give... any more, should be counted under its commitments that the cost of the loan for the lender countries (the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France did that make such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the document from the EU to check yourself.
It is the only country in the European Union to use if massively the loan.
Germany requires to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other) are meeting their commitments with 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is 1 to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice sleight of hand!
In summary, in his fast start funding, France operates a double scam: one hand on the evolution of the action in time and secondly on the reality of the financial effort.
Spending that 36.1 million euros, she comes to believe that she spends $420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it is Bercy who has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to provide if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is only a small matter, relative near term, relative to the whole discussion on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand of more in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever happens, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): you will not escape the issue of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become too progressive on these issues that it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary to make progress in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years consumed in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (former Movement for Rights and the respect of future generations).
The association, which cautions that its results "were not statistically significant in light of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," has purchased between July and September foods usually consumed four meals and a snack in one day by a child a dozen years in the Oise supermarkets and Paris.
These meals types, including the formal recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litre of water per day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet of the tax base is damning: 81 chemicals including 42 are probable or possible carcinogens and five substances are carcinogenic some and 37 substances that may act as endocrine disrupters (EP), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each substance taken individually are not exceeded, you can see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or MOU is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen potential carcinogenic residues and three found some carcinogens and almost two dozen residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack in the study, presents traces of six chemicals with a fungicide yet banned in France.
Same thing for green beans from Kenya, included in the luncheon, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even the loaves of bread and chewing gum were laden with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, steak salmon was the most "rich" with 34 residue chemicals detected and even the examination of the plastic base used to heat the meal in the microwave was not free.
The risk final for the "cocktails of contaminants" consumer "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
Europe Ecology Alliance - The Greens (EE, LV), for its part, has proposed "faced with the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study of the European agency for food safety (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of pesticides 365 different identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
