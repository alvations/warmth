Inflation, in Europe, skidded on the food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the zone euro, is due mainly has the fast increase in the prices of the food.
In November, the raising of prices, in the 13 country of the zone euro, was more important compared to the forecasts, after a rate of inflation of 2,6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3,1 percent was recorded, indicated the office of the statistics of the European Community located has Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, communicated Bloomberg.
Contrary to the banks central American, British and Canadian, the European central Bank (ECB) did not lower the directing rate of intéret by saying that the reduction in the intérets, with the growth of the prices of the matters premieres and lowers it rate of unemployment, would lead has the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would wish to maintain the rate of inflation below but near to two percent.
According to an analyst, it is Wrestling 22 for the ECB: "it is necessary to dissuade" inflation in order to not have more has to intervene on this subject later on.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3,3 percent is a record during these twelve dernieres years and in Spain, it went up of 3,6 A 4,1.
Inflation in the zone euro took off because of the fast increase in the prices of the food and energy.
The dimensions of future market of cereals increased by 88 percent and the course of soya also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of the edible oil and the dairy products increased also considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil increased by 52 percent and, last month, a barrel of black gold coutait almost 100 dollars.
According to ECB's, in 2008, the rate of inflation will pass from 2,1, this year, has 2,5 percent but, in 2009, it will drop has 1,9.
According to analysts', the rate of inflation over 12 months remains around the 3 percent, however, the 3 A 4 months next, the annual average rate will be 2,1 percent.
In same time, they expect has what the ECB decreases the directing rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a crisis of the government
After a long stagnation, the number of the partisans of Fidesz (Alliance of the young democrats) increased at the beginning of December significantly. Thus since 2002, it currently has the greatest number of partisans, whereas Gallup (Institute of survey) never noted such a weak socialist support before, has to know 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, because of the greatest determination of the voters of the opposition, a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one cinquieme (20 percent) for the MSZP (Left socialist Hungarian).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of the Hungarian democrats) and SZDSZ'S (Alliance of the free democrats) are below the threshold of members of Parliament: their support is two percent in all the population.
On the faithful voters some to go to vote, the number of the partisans of the two parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to worsen compared to the preceding point low, the proportion of those which judged that the economic situation of the country was particularly serious was never also high, it is assembled has 41 percent and according to 46 complementary percent the situation is rather serious.
After the more optimistic prospects for spring and summer the last, the families are again more pessimistic as for their financial standing.
For the next year, the majority of the population envisages an aggravation and only one dixieme envisages an improvement of the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of the probed people, have to know a majority ever seen at the time of the former surveys of Gallup, judged that the Prime Minister did his work rather badly that well.
13 probed percent of have confidence or much confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány whereas 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not make at all confidence with the Prime Minister and 27 percent with the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change of the political situation is the proportion of the company thinking that dissatisfaction with respect to the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
Whereas after the riots of last October, 35 probed percent of wished that the government and the Prime Minister remain in function, currently this rate represents only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) estimates that the behaviour of new elections would be the solution has this situation.
With the question concerning the intention of vote, 60 probed percent of answer that they certainly would vote and the 20 complementary percent say that they probably would vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 probed percent of would certainly take part and 15 complementary percent would probably take part. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be any doubt.
74 percent of people would say not to the registration fees in the higher education, 79 percent would say not to the expenses consultation and 84 percent would say not to subsistence expenses has the hospital.
When we look at only the same proportions among the people who expressed their intention to vote with the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of the registration fees, of the expenses of consultation and of subsistence expenses the hospital has.
Auchan is most expensive, Tesco increased its prices of almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets established in the commercial triangle of Budaörs maintained the increase average in the prices of 16 percent of the year derniere has the difference that this year the rate of the VAT did not increase.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the Basket of usual daily Christmas also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase in definitely higher value has thousand forints was posted in all the hypermarkets.
The prices, "which were déja flown away" in the department stores of supply last December, did not increase any more brutally compared to the preceding high base.
Nevertheless, the consumers are obviously shocked to see that the articles bought clearly below nine thousand forints the year derniere coutent now more than ten thousand forints.
The daily Basket in the probed hypermarkets exceeded of 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was assembled has 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was of 6 800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and alive fish remained almost on the level of the year derniere, however the prices of the turkey net, nut and the poppy strongly increased.
In the stores, the price of the flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of the Statistics) but, at Auchan, one found bread of one kilo only has 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was astonishing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the consigned bottle of two liters Coke was below 200 forints, it thus coutait only 257 forints the consigned bottle y included/understood.
It empeche only this year, in term of daily Basket, Auchan was most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Basket of 15 percent whereas Tesco and Auchan increased them respectively approximately 18 and 18 percent.
By comparing the basket expensive of the year derniere and the basket the least expensive of this year, we note a variation of 12 percent whereas the difference between the least expensive of the year derniere and expensive of this year is 21 percent.
The prices increased by 1 480 forints on average.
The year derniere, the prices increased by 1 206 forints on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the rate of the VAT was made déja noticed in the prices of Christmas of the last year.
This process made perplexed the trade, the hypermarkets could not determine obviously which margin to apply to products so much they were unable to envisage the impact of the change of the prices on consumption.
(If a tradesman badly calculates the rotation of a product, it is likely to lose a large profit on the adapted margin has the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change of the rate of the VAT, the raising of prices of the daily Basket evolved/moved in a so excessive way that the basket expensive was higher 1 720 forints has the value of that of 2006 whereas the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the basket expensive was higher 1 630 forints has that of the year derniere and the prices at least expensive increased by 1 284 forints also.
By bringing closer the two seasons Christmas, we noted a catastrophic increase in the prices, in less than 20 months the prices of the articles of daily consumption increased of more than 30 percent in the hypermarkets.
(This inevitably does not confirm the data of KSH: for certain food of premiere required, the institute of the statistics noted a raising of prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
Such is the case for example of the flour and egg.)
According to the daily Basket of this last, this appears quasi absurd since the level of price of this product, déja well expensive the year derniere, increased by hardly more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to indices', the suppliers of flour occupy a position stronger than the egg suppliers because they succeeded has to make also accept the brutal increase in the prices by the multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they record good years constantly.
According to our experiments, the majority of the customers does not look at any more the prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They achetent all in quantity, they take food of long conservation by pallets.
Wednesday morning of the important tails were formed with the cases of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased abruptly.
However, according to our information, the sales turnover is less important in province, about many multinationals complain aupres companies about survey same step to reach the sales turnover envisaged, not only for the food but also for the articles of durable consumption.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfecting
This year, more than thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in the hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of the hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of the medical personnel do not help has to block the infections, affirms the doctor as a chief of the national Center of epidemiology.
Many hospitals make also the economy on disinfecting
There is not a long time an infection MRSA was diagnosed with the casualty department of the János hospital.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The casualty of a serious car accident left the hospital but little time after it has to go back there because of an infection MRSA and, since, the doctors could not make him an important operation because of the bacterium which is in its organization.
Until December 10 of this year, 1 094 infections hospitalieres generated by a multirésistant agent pathogene were declared with the national System of monitoring nosocomiale, indicated Karolina Böröcz, doctor as a chief of the national Center of epidemiology.
Namely that it is the number of infections caused by a multirésistant agent pathogene which was really recorded in the hospitals and for the remainder we do not have any information.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by the MRSA, in other words by the resistant staphylococcus aureus the méthicilline-oxacilline has.
A third of people is carrying the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without it developing a disease.
The infections caused by SA (such as cutaneous anginas, tonsillites, infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily guérissables.
However, if the antibiotics are used in an excessive or inappropriate way, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium quite resistant to the antibiotics which will proliférera quickly under the bad conditions hospitalieres.
In the event of faulty operation provisional or prolonged immune system, this bacterium can cause serious infections hospitalieres, such as a traumatic infection or a septicaemia, on the old patients, of small weights or having a weakened organization.
According to the directing doctor of the János hospital, there is nothing private individual in infections MRSA, these infections form parts of the daily newspaper of the hospitals.
One should not especially confuse the infection with the epidemic, one does not only find a MRSA where they are not sought, Tibor Nyulasi said.
SA resist antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the looking after personnel puts on rubber glovees and masks of protection and we have antibiotics adapted to look after them", declared Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, the in-patients are examined whether they are carrying MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Prélevement of the sample is not has the fashion
The large majority of the infections caused by the MRSA could be warned but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable, in the Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and the proliferation of the agents pathogenes multirésistants, affirms Karolina Böröcz.
Like this infection appears especially in the hospitals and in the residences for old people, the hospitals should control the in-patients and immediately isolate the patients carrying MRSA.
However the prélevement microbiological one is not has the fashion in the Hungarian hospitals.
It should be known that the national Case of social security does not finance these examinations.
The majority of the cases are born only if infection MRSA is detectable on the patient, declared the doctor as a chief of the epidemiologic center.
The European Union has relative rigorous recommendations has the adapted use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian directives also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made so that the antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to empecher resistance to the drugs but the hospitals do not hold always account of it.
The realization of the microbiological prélevements is even rarer in the ambulatory care and in the basic care, Karolina Böröcz communicated.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfecting
Scientific evidence shows that the MRSA proliferent of a patient generally has another by the intermediary of the medical personnel.
It is thus of primary importance to wash the hands, to put on gloves and masks of protection. However important gaps are detected in the hospitals also in this field.
The MRSA proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, because of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient cannot always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often full, the beds often too are close the ones of the others whereas in term of epidemic, the patients should be distant the ones from the others of 1,5 meters at least.
Unfortunately, we also note that the hospitals, in difficult financial standing, make economies on disinfecting, they miss nurses, the patients are numerous, thus the risk of contamination is even taller, indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in the hospitals or the preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is weaker in a demonstrable way or then the proliferation of the agent pathogene can be blocked.
Governmental project counters the MRSA
The treatment of infection MRSA represents exorbitant expenditure for the cases of the social security, this is why one fights everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government established a program to prevent or decrease the incidence of the MRSA.
According to data's published, this program is effective and infections MRSA show a decreasing tendency in England.
The European Center of prevention and control of diseases (ECDC) revealed among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of the agents pathogenes multirésistants (like the MRSA also) as well as the prevention of the infections hospitalieres caused by these agents pathogenes.
The police chief, author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of intoxication
The relative official report has the fatal accident caused by the police chief of the 22e district was drawn up.
It can be excluded that the police chief from the 22e district, resigner of his station since, which crushed a pedestrian by causing his last Tuesday death, would have led in a state of intoxication or dazes, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the public Ministry of the capital after the relative report was established.
The report confirmed the first result of the investigation which has déja noted that the ex-police chief had not consumed alcohol before putting himself at the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police station of the 22e district crushed a 55 year old man who was face has him when it turned, with his personal car, in the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22e district. The man wanted to cross the road while not passing by the crossing for pedestrians.
(Moreover, the fact that it crossed the road outside the crossing for pedestrians does not constitute an extenuating circumstance, according to the Highway code a car which starts a turn must let pass the pedestrians.)
The pedestrian died after being transported has the hospital.
Following this accident, the police chief resigned of his station and it asked its retirement because, according to the communication of the police force, this accident A upset much.
The survey into this business is carried out by the Parquet floor in charge of the investigations of Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the ex-police chief cooperated as of the beginning with the magistrates charged to carry out the survey.
400 million additional euros for the infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister for Finance, and Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, Friday, has Budapest, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros concerning a credit limit in order to support teaching, the infrastructure of transport and environment as well as energetics.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of 300 million euros for the Hungarian budgetary financing of the projects of transport and of environment has to realize from the Funds cohesion of which a contract of credit of a value of 100 million euros has déja signed by the parts. This time, the signed contract relates to the use of the 200 million remaining euros.
The agreement on the credit of 150 million euros also relates to the budgetary financing of the dependent projects has teaching.
The EIB approved on the whole a sum of 300 million euros for Hungary, the 150 million remaining euros could be used later, following the extension of the contract of credit.
The parts signed a contract of 50 million euros for the innovation, the budget of state will initially use this envelope within the framework of the research project and of development has to realize has the University of Debrecen.
At the time of the negotiations, the project of line 4 of the subway was also approached.
The parts were appropriate that they would discuss again the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the subway with the EU.
According to János Veres, that could be done in the first quarter 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB granted on the whole 8,4 billion euros for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to rate's of intéret dependent A EURIBOR, with a grace period 8 years and without commitment fee.
Bulgaria, paradise of the real market of the EU
The Bulgarian real market trends are spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned towards this country of Balkans little quoted in the past.
What, or and who achete on this market of the EU which is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analyze Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is incontestably the target more in vogue of Eastern Europe with its apartments of ski and its houses at the edge of the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the seaside, Albéna, "gold Sands", the "Coast of the sun", old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly many A to seek a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik also.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, early or late, the central area of the country, has to know Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also wake up the intéret investors and they are also increasingly many A to buy in the corner well little expensive of Trick.
Sofia, the capital, offers also attracting opportunities, surfaces of trade and of offices promises the highest rate of depreciation.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the paradises of golf more attracting Europe and to be thus a priority destination, after the season of summer and the season of winter, also in the two other seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors achetent déja in great number, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts', the people buying a building in Bulgaria seek in same time has to change their life, their way of life.
The majority of the purchasers are English but others arrive from France, of Belgium, of Spain and more and more of Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. At the edge of the Black Sea and in the most considered ski resorts, we meet many Russian purchasers traditionally.
The foreign purchasers are divided into three groups, known as Georgij Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who hope to settle achetent renovated buildings, has a variable price between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or of old dilapidated houses, a going price of 5 A has 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are the accesses easy and the possibilities of communication, the proximity of a large city, stores and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes/understands the purchasers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria is quoted among the 10 premieres destinations of holidays in Germany).
The third group is composed commercial investors who achetent in the hope to carry out an appreciation has average or long-term.
The price of the buildings of the capital increases unceasingly because of an increasingly keen demand.
In the European Union, the real prices are lowest in Bulgaria. However, these 5 dernieres years, they increased by 21 percent each year.
The real raising of prices exceeds primarily the wage increase.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister for the environment and water, the meetings of the professionals achevent Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the mode of the international climate after 2012 will continue.
The experts and the politicians arriving of 192 countries of the world will discuss on the supposed Passenger waybill Bali to define the efforts has to make after the period of reduction of the emissions defined by the protocol of Kyoto until 2012.
In this moment, sharp discussions are carried out on this subject between the countries in the process of development and the countries developed.
The United States also announced that, for the moment, they did not wish to discuss on figures correct, however which they were prets has to sign an agreement on the reduction, until 2020, of the gas emissions has effect of greenhouse of 25 A 40 percent compared to the level of 1990.
Another important subject of the conference is to see whether the developed countries engage, except reduction of the emissions, has to provide a financial assistance and technological to the countries which need some.
An agreement was also signed concerning the assistances has to provide to the countries in the process of development.
The funds of assistance defined by the protocol of Kyoto will be managed by a board of directors made up of 16 members probably within the total framework of the Funds for the environment of UNO (GEF), communicated Piac és Profit (Gone and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the environment and water, confirm the ambition of the EU to keep its role of aiming flagship in the total efforts have to protect the climate and have to encourage the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU engaged has to reduce before 2020 its gas emissions has effect of greenhouse of 20 percent compared to the level reached in 1990, independently of the success of the signature of the "Accord according to 2012", and it was prete has to reduce them until A 30 percent if the other great areas of the world and/or the countries in the process of development were prets also has to pledge adapted is their responsible and has their capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatories of the protocol of Kyoto had aimed on the whole a reduction of 5,2 percent and all 15 member of the EU of this time pledged on 8 percent in less.
Hungary undertook to reduce the gas emissions has effect of greenhouse of 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fill its engagement, points out the press release of the Department of the Environment.
The stake is large A Bali because the international agreement in the long run on the climatic policy must be set up in the two years interval, if not the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be pushed back after 2012. In this case, engagements of reduction below the values envisaged in the protocol of Kyoto would not be immediately followed a new international system of reduction of the emissions for which the need was underlined in the new report/ratio of IPCC, international scientific body, which obtained the Nobel Prize of the peace of UNO, gave the responsability to be occupied of the climatic change.
The reduction of the emissions would be delayed by it and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 celcius degrees could not be avoided any more which, according to scientists', would have consequences extremement serious and irrevocable.
The British army recruits on YouTube
The units of the British army communicate, on the site of division of vidéos, of the recordings carried out at the time of its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with an aim of making itself popular.
Initially, it is the British air force (RAF) which was impassioned for YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan charge there of the sequences vidéos on the operations carried out against the talibans since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras rises on the helmet, are controlled with the headquarters of the operations of the air force has Kandahar and they are then transferred has London or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is impossible to circumvent
The soldiers of the air force have déja passed 139 sequences on the Net by this way and their "chain" was looked by more than 75 thousand people.
The ministry for British defense was registered there under the name of "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and it communicates vidéos on the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan whereas the ministry for the Commonwealth (the Commonwealth Office) and the international forces of maintenance of peace in Iraq (MNFI) also have their clean chains on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan

The propaganda published by this way coute practically nothing compared to last usual publicities of recruitment has television, communicated has the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defense. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the cogency of the military operations decided by the government.
American made a play
The army is embetée because, except the vidéos composed and censured carefully, from the vidéos amateurs passed on the site of division which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrites, the officers do not avoid speaking about the losses but they never present the side strapping of the combat.
Moreover, of many vidéos were déja passed on the Net presenting the zones of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan which were carried out on mission real, but the British army packs for the loading of these vidéos only recently.
American a little differently makes recruitment while being useful itself of the play of shooting America' S Army downloadable free. In this play the player can put himself directly has the place of the soldiers within the framework of a more or less real simulation.

Capital Political: the Hungarian Guard increased the country risk
According to Division analyzes of risk of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, made up last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for better Hungary) increases, under several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the area.
In its "warning of risk", the company announces that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is déja that "in the short run aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur following the aggravation of the ethnic tension déja existing between the population gypsy and not gypsy of Hungary".
The institute of research added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard probably aiming has to cause this situation is the principal reason.
As they say, that is explained by one of the principal gaps of the Hungarian political actors: "the public actors passed the relative public discussion has the business of Roms to the representatives of the radical political regroupings and extremes which based a political strategy on the disagreement between the Gypsies and the Hungarians".
The problem is some worsened, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists are seen reinforced and the arrival of the aggressive conflicts is more probable, say they.
However, according to the institute of research, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian Guard "deteriorated the image of Hungary significantly has the foreigner, in particular concerning confidence in the stability and the democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater given publicity has the reorganization of the radical groups and extremes right Hungarian since the autumn 2006, of many associations were made up in Hungary since summer 2007 giving itself the name of "national association of self-defence".
"the common feature of these gatherings is that they are defined as a civil organization whereas they publicly declare the preparation of their members has missions of defense (catastrophes, national defense, defense of the order), armed if it is needed, in addition, by evoking the inaptitude of the police force, the army, in other words of the state", they added.
They announced that all occurred according to the method which, while being based on the rancour of the company of the policy and the parties, seeks has to disguise various political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The stress laid on the civil character and the statute of association is not thus useful only which the legal pieges recording of these associations to the court has to avoid but they constitute also a political strategy.
The analysis announces that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor which also increases the risk compared to the relations of vicinity.
"These last months, of many close countries quote the Hungarian Guard like a potential source of risk and the political actors ultranationalists of certain countries bordering wish to justify their policy anti-Hungarian woman while referring has the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the area ", added.
According to the institute of research, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phénomene in Central Europe of the East, the political risks increased on the whole of the area.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, has the activity of the Bulgarian national Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian national Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many disorders of Roms which burst in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are has the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
While benefitting from these events, the BNU decided to constitute a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is "the national self-defence".
According to them, these 17 dernieres years, the gypsies "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative had caused sharp debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of certain Bulgarian organizations of Roms concerning the constitution of their own guard as a resistance announces the increase in the risk of the ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing of the similarities with that of the Bulgarian national Guard excluded not that Hungarian Roms react has the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can one read in the warning of risk of Political Capital.
With the request for information of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, director of search for Capital Political, said: the analysis of risk is one of the activities of the institute of research.
Like it has said, their analysis of risk is published every year and if events occurred which could have an impact on the change of the risk, they inform the public opinion of it, as in this case, by publishing a warning of risk.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines the days of fete exactly and, around the fetes, it became current to reorganize the working days of which the number will decrease the next year.
The fetes are not uniform in the EU and in the United States either.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days from fete national and state as well as the days of rest.
The days of rest are often dependent have religious fetes or have important historical events.
In Hungary, we fetons New Year's day, the last day of the year which finishes and the first day of New Year's day are also days of rest, this last all the more so that réveillonneurs can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we in all eleven fetes marked in red.
March 15 is a national fete, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, like October 23 also which is the day commemorative of the revolution of 1956.
August 20, we fetons the constitution of our state, May 1 is the fete work and 1st and November 2, we remember the members of our family and our friends deceased.
Moreover, we have two days have Easter, have Pentecost and have Christmas.
The days of our fetes of state, main roads or chocolate éclairs seldom falling over a weekend, according to the calendar, it became current to reorganize the working days in the cases or there remains only one working day before or after the fete marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the weekend prolonged while working or while going has the school saturdays preceding the prolonged weekend.
Since long years, the Minister for Labour rules in a regulation particuliere over the days of replacement of the days preceding or following the fetes.
The law extends for all the employers and all their employees employed, on the civils servant and the people working in the public utility.
It is not worth however for the service companies, the institutions turning without interruption and in service, from their vocation, and also for the days of rest.
This year, the working days will be modified only around the fetes of end of the year: from December 24, the life arrete almost in all the country bus according to experiments' the majority of people is made rather overtime or takes holidays that they saved has these ends to be able to spend the days between Christmas and the day of New Year's day on their premises.
The next year much of fetes fall in the medium or has the weekend, consequently there will be less changes on the level of the working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the premiere time around the fete work to make it possible to the employees to remain on their premises four days of sharp.
Saturdays April 25 will be one working day to have one day of rest Friday May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: saturdays October 18 will be one working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the fetes bus from December 24, everyone will make a same pause not-stop if the day of New Year's day fall over one Wednesday.
Six futile things which can embeter terribly the colleagues
Courriels that we forget to send, of the vocal messages whom we never receive, of the innocent lies which aggravate us almost more: in fact things "embellish" the daily newspaper of a place of work.
The question is to know if one is accustomed has these troubles or one releve the challenge and one avoids the ambiguous situations consciously, causing troubles with the others.
Examples.
"I Excuses, I forgot to say to you that you were called service marketing", a colleague says you.
What did you miss an appointment?
At best it is sorry and tries to arrange the things by calling the service marketing to say to them that it forgot to pass the message (it is the least current solution).
In the majority of the cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to reflect how you will be able to cause unpleasant moments has your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something which does not belong to you?
There is nothing more irritating to want to take a file, an office automation tool or the telephone and you do not find them nowhere.
You remember that the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
You find by chance your pen which you believed lost on the desk of your colleague?
Do not take anything has your colleagues without asking if not they are right to be annoyed against you to have piqué their good.
Ramene not of envelopes, of post-it in your pocket because it can be embetant that there is not more and that you need some immediately.
You papotes of the private life of the colleagues?
There are not good means for arreter pewters which are propagated.
Who did what, with which?
Or and why?
Do not tell has everyone your information (assumptions) on the private life of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his secrecies intimate with you, does not misuse its confidence!
Bury in you shared information and does not discuss it with your colleagues in his same absence if your colleagues are well-informed also.
You declare yourself sick without right reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under pretext of a tearing evil of tete because you smell yourself badly or you regards to need rest that day, thinks of the fact that your work, your urgent businesses, your missions has term must be carried out by somebody of other A your place.
Do not make troubles has your colleagues!
If you know the advance has that the following day you will not work or that something can arrive which would oblige you has to remain at home, does not forget to warn your chief and your colleagues to prevent that they are astonished by your absence the following day.
Fredonnement, snigger, telephone
You plunge yourself in your work but the snigger of your colleagues t'en tears off brutally?
You became, without wanting it, witness of a discussion by telephone which you would have better done not to listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with fredonnements, chantonnements, discussions has high voice (that you menes above their tete), beats of feet, coarse words or expressed dissatisfactions has high voice.
They can disturb same if your colleagues are not plunged in a project (drafting, design, organization).
You show the others for a fault?
If your work is not made for the allowed time, you forget to send a mail or an important message, does not show anybody for this lapse of memory!
Do not put it on the account of possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a fault and if that presented disadvantages for the others, repairs the fault!
Ask how you could repair your fault, repairs the negligence!
You smell yourself too much at home at the office?
To put a jogging and slippers is comfortable A the house but they are not appropriate for the office!
Do not put a same comfortable jogging if your function allows it!
Would not be neglected, respects your colleagues and you-same by equipping you correctly, and if your function requires it by putting pretty and elegant clothing, to go to work!
If you want to answer waitings, you are not interesting any more
One advances gently in the usual stopper of the morning.
Suddenly, a melody particuliere is made hear has the radio: the voice of a violin has which electronic effects are associated.
I assemble the sound.
The music changes rate/rhythm and the low one is able to accompany the tone by all has the hour, then a female choral society comes to join to it like a true jewel.
Mr2 diffuses the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with a pop electronics of good quality.
However, now it appears that the stopper becomes different if you listenings the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting productions born Hungarian numerical underground start little by little has to change the overall picture and, in spite of the new fashion of the rock'n'roll of garage tearing the guitar, the Hungarian électropop proves that there is the new one under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived of Pécs and there played itself in the group of Yonderboi before it does not launch out on its own way, perhaps because "it is no place for two feet in a same shoe".
Its project (Zagar) and its music, an alloy of jazz, dancing music electronic and pop, started has to be made known when one entrusted to him the composition of filmed soundtracks (for example
The season of Ferenc Török).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs started has known by general public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty more important discs of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the quasi only creators of the Hungarian tendency who would be also competitive has the west.
Zagar and its unit became incontestably "trendy" but nobody asked to them whether they wanted to carry this label well.
The group reacted as it is necessary, it left new and better disc.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, left recently, can open new ways for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the last years has Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the old group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there well with the reference to the flight but has side of the air music appears now, according to the spirit and the tendency of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of the rock'n'roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed its talent in these songs at the time of the premiere of the album to the thousand-year-old Park.
On the album, one finds a true tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, diffusing recently popular music of the morning at the evening, started has to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All well thus goes (?).
hvg.hu raised questions has Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes to me has to raise a question: did your music remain a music well aiming at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aiming at a certain layer does not tell me large thing.
For me there are two castes in the music légere; not mainstream or underground, not pop alternative or but commercial music and sincere music.
The alternative musics oneself saying, underground can also poor and be only made to sell them and become thus commercial.
However, a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception functions in this spirit also independently of the language or the borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the public Hungarian and foreign, one or the other is more open A your music?
Zs.B.: With the foreigner, especially the west the music légere has has older traditions.
, people go to the concerts and not only the young people of ten or scores years but also oldest.
They follow with much more attention the changes which have occurred in the music légere because they think that it also forms part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which is the role of the public in your work?
Es you interested of knowing which, or and how much people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that people come increasingly many A our concerts.
However we never made music for the market.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important with the concerts or the mutual influence functions déja but it is perceived only in the imperceptible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you wanted to answer waitings of the public, you will not be interesting any more.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
It only works and made career rather has the west.
Zs.B.: We do not go on really his same way if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather players equips some who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it be spread.
At the beginning, it was well on inevitable that our music is compared has that of Yonderboi because we are several A to leave his group and has to take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the premiere place.
Many are those which heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style you opened consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs.B.: We did not envisage to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song wants to say more things.
We wanted it for final album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult topics approached in all the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - which was the hot line?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choral society of the gospel kind.
We had the idea to compose this choral society of good soloists of the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus the choral society was made up has six members, has to know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [ Neo ], Juci Németh, which one baptized then Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: You wanted this song like that or the girls modified it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece existed déja in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought that it still missed something has this song.
The continuation of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody which the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and all was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that that galvanized me has the time but quite sour we needed the Divas.
With my voice it would not have had the same force.
hvg.hu: On the disc and with the concert also it seemed to to me that the girls were in arriere plane.
There is no solo (the exception of a short solo of Judy Jay has), they do not have a role only, they sing all unit and they do not sing more extremely than the music, therefore the music does not make only accompany their song.
They were derriere too on the scene.
Is this desired?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in arriere plane is only has technical problems.
On the other hand, which was voluntary, it is that we did not want to distribute roles of soloist.
The song also says that we must forget a little our ego, to forget which comes from or, which goes or, it is necessary just to leave that these wings, the wings of the love, carry us.
I wanted that the others also feel this euphoric state which we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work more?
Zs.B.: To tell the truth, none as for the processes of musical creation, we had more difficult pieces at the time of the mixture.
For example, with Dorian Gray' S Dilemma, or I play has a concert grand, or Rock' Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove did not want to function for a long time, and then, gradually, very was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which your is preferred on the new album?
Zs.B.: Ca changes all the time with the concerts and owing to the fact that I have déja "released" this disc.
In this moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious trador risked billion because of his complex of inferiority
A defrauder dissimulator.
Thus designates his former employee the French giant the general Company, owner of the Czech bank Komer?ní banka.
The bank lost because of him nearly five billion euros.
However it seems rather than Kerviel is only a one large player who wanted to equalize his colleagues, and who, moreover, can by no means be regarded as incompetent.
Contrary to all the large houses of bank, it recognized in time the crisis of the American market of the mortgages.
"It is fragile", implied its superiors who denounced it with the police force.
However, if one sticks to the deposition of Kerviel brought back by the French media, of which the World, the transactions of this man produced at the end of the year last a rising benefit with 1,6 billion euros.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All that I wanted, it was to gain of the money for my bank", affirms it in the deposition.
Last summer, it succeeded in benefitting from the American crisis to gain one half-milliard of euros.
In fact, it felt the occasion from the very start of the year.
Information started to emerge in February according to which the mortgages known as "sub-premium", granted to customers with low income or with those which had met in the past of the difficulties of refunding, would have problems.
But this crisis should not influence the whole of the economy.
Kerviel did not believe in it and it misé well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefit amounted to 1,6 billion euros.
"As soon as I had gained my first half-milliard, I did not know how to announce it", Kerviel entrusts and adds that it does not have, of course, nothing kept for itself."
In all the interrogation, it acknowledges to have distorted the reports/ratios not to be detected.
It succeeded in deceiving its superiors, although the Eurex purse started to be interested in its transactions.
Who does not risk anything does not have anything
Did it fear to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I estimated that the simple fact of having obtained 1,6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
From which does its will come to risk so large?
It arrived to its station only gradually.
It had started to work at the General Company in 2000 Juste after having finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual wages turned around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already assistant of trador and, in 2005, he became trador independent with annual wages of 90 thousand dollars.
However, it knew that it would never gain as much as the others.
"As of my first maintenance in 2005, I knew that I was considered much less than the others.
Taking into consideration my professional and personal course and my university course ", specified with the Kerviel investigators.
However, little after its entry in function, it gains its first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz actions, it gained one half-milliard of euros while misant on the fall of this title at the time of the attacks of London.
And the mechanism was started - he wanted more.
As long as you gain, one leaves you in peace
"There was as an effect swell of snow", has it says to the police officers.
But the superiors were well-informed of all, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I gained, they made pretence close the eyes."
However, at this point in time the blow of the beginning of the year occurs.
It loses a billion euros in one day.
At mid-January, after the weekend, it decides to occult the sum.
Monday, when it arrives at work, it is not bank clerk any more.
A few days afterwards, the bank announces that it lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how was it discovered?
It became suspect because of its vacation.
"the year spent, I took only 4 days off.
A trader which does not take holidays is a trader which does not want to leave its book with another ", concludes Kerviel.
Tchéquie has the occasion to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers for the Czech government signed in very nine operational programs with European Commission representatives, who could, in the years to come, to bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
It acts about of half of totality of the sum which Tchéquie can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns resulting from seven operational programs will be intended for the Czech areas.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns within the framework of the Entreprise program and innovation.
The transport sector will profit from the greatest part, up to 150 billion.
The Transports program is the operational program most important and represents up to 22 percent of financial means that Czech Rép. can obtain within the framework of these projects.
This money will be at the origin of a rise of the budget of the national Fund of the infrastructure of transport which will manage the next year a sum of 90,8 billion crowns.
The program Undertaken and innovation, intended for SME and the contractors, must be used to obtain financial means to encourage the innovation within the company.
The companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective methods of management.
Until now, Czech Rép. formed part, among the new members, of the recipients of the funds of the EU the least crowned success.
The Court confirmed the 20 years sorrow of prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed Thursday sorrow the 20 years of prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which it was condemned in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1,8 billion crowns).
However, later it was released and lived assigned with residence in its hacienda close to the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former chief of this State center-American, in function between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again encarcéré is not for the moment, according to agency AP, not clearly.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, all will depend now on the agents of prison, or they will let Aleman finish its sorrow at his place, or will go again in prison.
4 years ago, the Court proved that Alemán regularly moved the money of the government towards accounts from foreign companies in Panama.
They were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of its family and to her closest partisans.
A part of this money went in the funds that Alemán had created in order to finance its election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
It is thus.
The official budget was adopted.
In what this budget is it exceptional?
It is the first budget conceived by this government and accepted by the governmental majority without opposition supports.
That for the current year passed one year ago thanks to supports Czech socialist party -?SSD, since it is the Sobotka minister who had prepared it and?SSD could not allow its refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate preceding the vote by the declaration of distrust to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Commons adopted without any problem this law which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
Here is a kind of paradox.
That one wants it or not, each chapter and each article constitute the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget left constituent the policy, though occulted behind the competition of capacity opposing government and opposition.
The latter is gravitational médiatiquement and it is for that that one gives more attention to him in the media.
The arguments of the politicians interest much more the opinion that the figures abrupt.
The national budgets of the last socialist governments suffered from three evils which the current budget is not ready to regulate at the same time:
The first being the important share granted to the expenses of mandates imposed by the law, consisted not only by the retirements, but also the social contributions, adopted last year by the quiet "coalition" gathering parties?SSD and KS?M.
The second being an overdrawn economy, consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, it, are consisted the deficit of the finance public, i.e. by the deficit of the cities and the communes.
However, it is not the deficit of the official budget which represents the greatest risk.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The true bomb with delayed-action, it is the deficit of the cities and the communes.
Many mayors often emitted, into thoughtless, of the obligations, involving in debt their municipalities inordinately, in order to obtain, put aside the money coming from the taxes, the revenue duties and the appropriations of bank, of new sources of investment.
In the years spent, they succeeded in refunding these debts by the sale in mass of the actions of the systems of distribution, in particular of those of energy, obtained State within the framework of privatizations.
Today, they do not lay out any more a this souce.
If one sticks only to the official and verifiable facts, one notes that:
Our economy has crossed already for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and?SSD does not fail to be windy about it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize the finance public.
However, in the place of that, they involved in debt the State more and more.
Other countries, settings besides some exceptions like Hungary, Albania or Egypt, managed their business in a way much more reasonable than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame which falls down primarily on the preceding governments.
We form part of the countries which, on a total scale, are threatened by poverty.
We thus do not have no need for massive social programs which are, precisely these last years, unfortunately unnecessarily swollen.
Although one succeeded in removing a part of the absurd populist expenditure, approved the year spent before the elections, if a shift of the age limit for the retirement, as well as a reform of the system of the retirements will not take place soon, then any policy will cease existing in this country and whoever will be with the capacity, it will do nothing but manage.
While hardly éxagérant, one can say that the politicians with the capacity will become bureaucrats méchaniquement distributing the majority of the money imposed between the retirements and the social security benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be a revolutionist, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes that the ordinary expenses are pushed back by the expenses of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion envisaged for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the preceding governments had not dissipated all the money which they could.
If we really do not want that it happens that the policies with the capacity become simple bureaucrats, it is necessary for us to be patient and to grant to this fragile, conscious governmental coalition that the State can spend only the equivalent of what it manages to take in taxes and in revenue duties, calms necessary to the preparation of new laws of reform.
There are only these last which will make it possible to gradually reach a balanced official budget.

The banks want to regulate the crisis
The federal Bank of American reserve, the European central Bank and the banks central English, Swiss and Canadian decided to fight the crisis of the financial markets together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be thus placed on the money markets by the intermédiare of bidding.
It will be a question for the banks of selling, by a system of bidding, the interest rates auquels they are ready to borrow money.
By way of example, the American EDF will send to the biddings 40 billion dollars and, moreover, it will provide 24 billion to the central Banks European and Swiss.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 which the central Banks of individual States decided of a concerted action at this point, aiming at preventing, to even decrease the effects of the financial crisis.
"This step tends to regulate the major problems of the economy, namely the lack growing of free capital that the banks could lend", written in his report/ratio with the customers Bernard Baumohl of the company of council Economic Outlook Group.
"the joint action of the central Banks decreased the probability of a recession in the United States of 65 percent to approximately 50 percent", adds Baumohl in his report/ratio.
The banks already lost 60 billion dollars because of the not refunded loans, especially in the United States.
The analysts still await other losses of billion.
"If the central Banks chose this step, it is that they must really apprehend what can still follow", known as the chief economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It appears that the situation is really bad", it adds.
The central Banks fear that, if the banks themselves have a difficult access to the loans, they will lend to their customers expensive.
This would decrease consumption and would plunge the American economy in a recession being able to influence the economic growth of the whole world.
The central Banks made this choice after one did not succeed in cause a drop in the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
What meant that the banks always feared the mutual loans, although the Banks central American, Canadian and English decreased on several occasions, during the autumn, their interest rates.
"That will have the same effect which a new fall of the interest rate", known as at the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Certain analysts do not believe that the step of the central Banks will not contribute to entreat the crisis, since it does not regulate the principal problem which is the fall of the real market in the USA.
President Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
The total climatic changes are supposed to harm the countries in the process of development especially.
President Václav Klaus again came to a conclusion about the problems of the planetary reheating.
Criticism fell down this time on the international conference of the United Nations on the climatic changes finishing in Bali.
In Vienna, where it presented its book the blue planet, not green, it stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisted a mixture curious representatives about governments and not-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference that there is between rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"the debate is not structured there a whole, it is only one rocket of words, substitute of the solutions to the current problems", said Klaus.
The Czech president underlined, at the time of the presentation of his book, that its subject has for him a great importance and it is for that that it engages as much for this cause.
It also expressed its satisfaction of what its book also appears in German translation, since, it has says, "I do not meet often that the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, the interested people can read its positions without they being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he has nevertheless, in his opinion, enough of provisions to write such a book.
It is indeed an academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of the statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, in his opinion, the following theses: the climate evolves/moves unceasingly, the changes of this one are thus normal, it does not exist an opinion shared by all the researchers on the planetary reheating, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too low registers, they thus do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts carried out in order to influence the evolution of the climate are useless, ineffective and inacceptablement expensive.
More especially as having experience of a totalitarian mode, it regards as unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on the others, which it feels like a dangerous attack with freedom.
In answer to the questions of the people present, it explained on several occasions why it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrist environnementalism which does not take into account the relation between the expenses and the profit that they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek institute.
600 thousand people did not succeed in renewing to them driving licence in times
Six hundred and thousand drivers let expire the time and did not succeed in renewing their old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.

By doing this it could be forced to pay to 30.000 crowns.
The Ministry had called the authorities with moderation and to impose fine not going beyond 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry for transport Karel Hanzelka, nobody risks fines of tens of thousands.
The driving licence constitutes, according to him, a document whose people can decide if they wish to have it or not.
It is not as with the indentity card which, it, must be valid without exceptions.
The people not wishing more to lead should give to them driving licence.
It is enough to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.

Does the lawyer of the families disaster victims Igor Veleba want to obtain hospital of T?ebí? a compensation for 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for the fathers and a million for each child.
The hospital proposes a maximum of 200.000 for each parent.
This is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond?ej Dostál is absolutely not agreement with the proposal of Veleba.
"We refuse such a claim, this one are very very high", said Dostál to the exit of the audience.
"to be capable to form an opinion about the counter-proposition, we need the report/ratio of expert of which the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We will check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands ", underlined Dostál.
Would the amount owe, in his opinion, being fixed between 100.000 and 200.000 K? for each four parent.
From the beginning of the business, the family of Jablo?ov requested a million crowns for each month when it could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba was useful of the report/ratio of expert, written for him by the university hospital complex in Prague-Motol, like one document with the support for the negotiations of the compensation.
According to experts' in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered a psychological damage and were prone to the stress to various scales and depths.
The situation of stress was supported better by the men, although they were confronted with the remorses not to have known to prevent the substitution of theborn ones.
The women, they, remain less serene in front of lived of the traumatism in the topicality and in front of what occurs precisely in this moment, the contents of the Veleba report/ratio summarized.
Were Veronika and Nikola substituted by nurses for the hospital of T?ebí? last 9 December.

Polívka lost Vala?ské Království (the Kingdom of Vala?sko)
Bolek Polívka lost the litigation about the mark Vala?ské království (Kingdom of Vala?sko).
According to is the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it indeed him which had used for the first time the title King de Vala?sko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá? Harabi?, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at the audience of today.
However, according to its lawyer, the business is probably not finished and its customer will appeal.
"does the litigation relate to the fact that Mr. Harabi? and its team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Polívka, "said after the lawsuit lawyer of Polívka.
According to him, the Royaume words of Vala?sko precisely evoke with everyone this actor and comic.
Harabi? is of the same opinion.
"There is behind us a work of almost ten years.
Of research of the money and development of events "it has says.
In his opinion, it is the money which is the cause of the litigation.
"After years, they realized that the project has success and that they could benefit from it.
It is them which want to parasitize on our work ", it added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it is Polívka which used for the first time the title vala?ský král (King de Vala?sko) in its television broadcast.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned it king in 1993.
However, at the time, that did not have a relationship with the project to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi? came with the idea to make appear passports of Vala?ské Království.
A humorous action in the beginning it left there a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed creation, by Harabi?, company Vala?ské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that its name and its signature are quoted in the passport and it even proposed to the holders balances on the price of the visit of its farm and its spectacles of theatre.
Who will sit down on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi? did nothing but use the naked idea, published by mané Polívka in the emission?, at commercial purposes.
"the popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainemement helped the project Vala?ské království," said the judge.
It added however that the heart of the project was consisted Harabi? and its team which devoted itself to the intense project of manner.
Did collaboration between the parts now enemy continue until 2000 when Harabi? for Polívka an official crowning with Vsetín organized.
But from there, of the conflicts started to accumulate between Polívka has Harabi?, who culminated with the deposition "of king Boleslav 1st elected official for always".
The role directing in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi?, assumed by the singer Jarmila?uláková as a Queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka carried felt sorry for against Harabi? and its company, asks that the court rejected today.
What could draw with light the business, it is the tournament under consideration for the throne and a half of the princess.
It should leave a new king it.
It did not want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We do not want to go quickly in work.
that would be quelquechose like the procession of the kings with Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr Polívka can be obviously registered ", added Harabi?.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparition of the prejudices
To tell the truth, I was never a large fan of Peugeot 206.
Its qualities of bearing were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the shifting of speed, control and also that of manufacture could, with many regards, being described as lower than the average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor Peugeot 207 which, it, is definitely better.
More especially as the combi named SW still goes a step further, it does not remain me any more but with better reflecting.
When I tested the traditional hatchback of Peugeot 207 I complained for example space for the head on the seats about behind.
Whereas there finished complaints because the body combi means that even the great strapping fellows will be, in this respect, at ease.
Let us see quickly made
I very quickly will evoke the interior not to repeat myself too much.
It acts of an about successful design, my only remark relating to the central tunel which appears poor to me.
There, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, since the car has the air so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or too short files is completed.
Side guidance also clearly improved compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in dimensions of the body is appreciable there too.
The combi sees also disappearing the lack from place above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
Most important on this vehicle, it is thus its soutte with luggage.
I must evaluate this one like very quite accessible (also thanks to the swivelling ice back) and of a rather easy stowing.
Spaces plug are provided with rubber bands of stop which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not cumbersome and can be wide while being able to hold of the objects asez heavy.
But let us stop with volume.
This one made, according to the tables, 428 L in the basic configuration, which is compared to competition a rather average figure.
Setting with share the?koda Fabia Combi, conveys more sold this category in Tchéquie.
If one compares the 207 SW with rising generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, one notes that Peugeot remains very appreciably behind, the difference being in 52 liters.
When it is a question of leaving on leave abroad or to charge poussette, this figure is quasi critical.
But, if I were to emphasize the advantages, I would mention the underbody remaining after the inversion of the files of the back seats perfectly right, or a very low footboard.
120 horses distributed out of four cylinders
The car that we tested was been driven by a Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1,6 L and a power of 88 kw.
And to tell the truth, it is with that that one should resemble 1,6 which makes go a family hatchback.
It is quiet, consumes little and, especially, it pushes well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by?koda which often gives the impression to have a muffler stopped by a floorcloth, then I can be only enthusiastic for it.
Let us traverse the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not accessible by all.
However, one must be aware that one tested a car equipped rather well, with a roomy interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a Otto engine 1,4 liters rising to 329 900 K? is still passable.
The vehicle that we tested costs starting from 410 900 K?, what is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 K?.
However, we laid out in more of airbags head, of an automatic air-conditioning, essuis-ice automatics, an automatic control of the windows postpone...
Actually, the vehicle costs 531 900 K in the last analysis?.
It is much, but try to add to the price of Fabia the additional equipment and you will obtain a very similar figure.
It thus does not remain any more but to choose the mark.
The integration of the Slovak pupils in the britanic schools goes badly
The number of children originating in the countries in Eastern Europe in the britanic schools is growing, which causes among residents of concerns about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Europeans of the east runs up, for the moment, with a series of obstacles.
The britanic schools note even cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin are transformed into violences.
The case of Kent of north, where start to be accentuated the resident adverse conflicts and immigrants of Slovak origin illustrates well the problem of the integration of the children originating in Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the baffle and the brawls between the pupils were transposed in the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far the police force stopped in Chatham a Slovak woman who struck with an iron bar a ten year old pupil.
The culprit defends herself by affirming that the boy had insulted it by remarks rasists.
The police force also had to intervene following the attack against a Slovak immigrant conducted by two teenagers.
The girls had allegedly addressed to this man racist remarks and stones had thrown to him.
"When one returned to the house, young person climbed on the stop of bus and started to spit us above.
When I said to him to stop, it answered by apples and pears and then it discovered its buttocks ", described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are formulated by the two parts.
One of the residents went until qualifying the conflicts with the immigrants of fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify than the atmosphere in the britanic schools between the inhabitants to origin and the immigrants starts to be tended.
70 thousand Slovak come to find work is recorded in the United Kingdom.
And approximately 30 thousand Slovak pupils attend the britanic schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
All that you await from your vacation can be carried out if you make a good choice.
Beaches gilded and white like snow, of the high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and the inclusive all with waiters offering to you on the beach a pizza pie, ice or many cocktails enivrants.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the caster.
On the islands of the sea of Caraîbes, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find still much more and it is Cuba, largest and the most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
In the the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb qualified like the most beautiful place that the human eye never saw.
Havana became the deposit and the place of transshipment of the treasures which the Spaniards had stolen and which they transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was set up with the whole beginning of the years 20'.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the Maffia American, which made it build, since all that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was allowed and constant in Cuba: drug, games of chance, prostitution.
Parmis its customers, there was, inter alia,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings in height pushed and of the cars, pertaining to the symbols worships of the years 50' of last century, circulated on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, close to Havana, and, in Cojímar, it had its yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and the politicians of whole America left their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a hotel of luxury, one will mix you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars worships always circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and the fiats formerly imported have already for a long time, in a climate if salted and wet, rotted.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is appreciably decrepit, nullepart elsewhere in the neighbourhoods it does not have as many monuments there colonial splendid there is precisely over there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Being given that tourism brings the money so necessary, its development has the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels pushed not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still proposes an imagination which is single in the world and which will be appreciated especially by the amateurs of small trains.
The cane had returned since the plantations extended in the sugar refineries on a narrow gauge railway by small engine and steam trains.
Their travelling material was not renewed during tens of years and thus one can see there moving of the small engines whose contemporary ones are not elsewhere only in museums.
Towards where to direct its steps?
The majority of the visitors does not miss the most known places.
There thus does not need to write some long on Varadero or on Havana.
If not to point out that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that that which loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vi?ales in the west of the island constitutes one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
A vegetation exhubérante pushes there on a calcareous ground.
Mogotes, balloons limestones and rocks go up out of candle of the bottom of the valley, and, with the fertile ground being taken in their entrails, even its rotted rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where one probably cultivates the cuban tobacco of best quality.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the factories of cigars of Havana.
Somebody will find perhaps also interesting that it is there that at summer turned the Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old city founded little time after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It is the market the trade of the slaves and that of the sugar which brought glory and the richness to him.
The richness was incarnated in the beauty and the character city-window of this town of reduced size.
Will Koloniální?pan?lská architektura, výrazn? ovlivn?ná pozd?j?ími francouzskými osadníky, za?ty?i staletí tém?? nezm?nila.
Trinidad, located between the mountainous sea and solid mass Escambray, is a place at such point with the variation that still in the years 50' of last century, there was no road which would link this region with the remainder of the country.
This insulation enabled him to remain on side.
Nothing was built, and this is why one demolished nothing either, each one was satisfied to have a roof above the head.
If one has, in Trinidad, more time than one afternoon, then it is worth the sorrow to go to also see places interessants in the neighbourhoods, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of the Sugar refineries.
Then, the evening, it is of habit of going to Casa of Música which becomes animated after laying down it sun and where the music is deafened only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some indicate this village located at the extreme Is of Cuba like most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly influenced already by the way which carries out to it.
The two roads which carry out to it since Guantánamo must cross high and broken mountains and almost cross a landscape without marks of the human activity.
UNESCO registered the shelf Is of Cuba, thanks to its landscape intact, on the list of the world inheritance.
One manufactures the best chocolate there, with the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (actually, it was born about hundred years after the tour of Colomb) and since the hill where is held the old castle-extremely and the current hotel El Castillo, one sees several mountains counts, of which most famous is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, mountainous solid mass Maestra Sierra, Bay of sows and island Isla de Pinos, cabaret Tropicana, sanctuary of holy the patrone of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, of Santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of the former slaves, about all that one could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, like one precisely says, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, affirm the Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment necessary influences, according to United States's, the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister for defense Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan does not proceed as it would have, agreed at Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries which have troops in the southern part of the country.
At side of the increasing dispute on behalf of the movement Taliban, the eight implied States discuss today also future plans and the coordination of the allies.
Whereas the United States called this week by the intermediary of the Minister for defense Robert Gates the troops of NATO to a greater activity, the United Kingdom sees like priority the reinforcement of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of the development aid.
"the evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but the military power can constitute only one part of the solution.
The other being to make it possible to the inhabitants to start themselves a new development of the economy and safety ", said to chain BBC the Minister for the britanic defense Of Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurrectionists is, according to data's of the American army, most intense of these five last years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the year spent, up to 60 percent in the Helmand province, located at the south of the country.
The countries of NATO have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter in the southern part.
However, according to United States's, the allies reached their absolute limit and in the organization and the equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the drive of the Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously reflect on the concrete objectives for the period to come, just as on the manners how to reach them", Gates said.
The secretary-general of NATO Jaap de Hoop held today of the similar remarks.
"I am not content with what we have on ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and the equipment which we would need, and that is not enough ", said De Hoop to the Reuters agency at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo which lasted three days.
Who is passive
These last months also reign between the implied countries of the conflicts concerning the question if all the allies make indeed in Afghanistan all their possible.
For example Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"the Germans have in Afghanistan a representation comparatively numerous.
But they are engaged in zones where violence is minimal, the requirements of combat of which they are prone are thus not as rigorous as those in the Southern parts and Is country where we operate ", Gates said.
The tabloid britanic Sun qualified this week the German soldiers the lazy one.
"lazy Afghan discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight ", wrote Sun in a document supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing the tenis of table.
The German newspaper Bild passed to the counter-attack by publishing the photograph of a britanic troop at the time of a match of Rugby in the southern part of Afghanistan.

It is interesting that the rise is generated especially by the government bonds where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but other side that indicates that there are grounds for to negotiate when the reform comes from the retirements ", commented on the Pikora data.
Better than than one waited

The British was shown to have let pupils from 6 to 7 years give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear whereas any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was liable to a sorrow of blows of whip.

Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children out of 23 have chooses Mohamed like preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Moslem prophet, but especially a first name very common to Sudan.
The children then carried out a book for the class with the photograph of the bear followed legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult with Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching in the same school in Sudan, specified that he knew it well and that she would never have done anything which can be insulting towards a religious faith, "I regret just that she asked the children to vote for a name", it acts according to him only of one "innocent error".
Opinion divided by many pupils of the teacher who describe it like "very attentive towards his pupils" and "which never speaks about religion in class".
Let us recall that the Mohamed first name is also the second first name more given in the United Kingdom, it is written of English in 14 different ways.
This first name often chooses by the Moslem families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given the first child of a family).
But which are the rules concerning the use of this first name?
Can one for example give it to a toy?
It acts of course of a question of interpretation.

They must finish as they started: with the Security Council."
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had answered that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the statute", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on behalf of the albanophones would be done "in dialogue" with the Westerners.

Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have been necessary more than seven working hours in space for the astronaut Scott Parazynski and for his comrades of crew of the international space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential with the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit which accumulated the records because of its duration, of its distance of the livable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, of the tools "arranged" by the astronauts to carry out repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday whereas the astronauts had discharged from the Discovery shuttle the module Harmony, a large cylindrical part charged to accomodate the scientific laboratories soon European and Japanese (see framed).
This module is a kind of quay of landing for the module-laboratories.
But it is necessary to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was thus to move a module of production of electricity by solar panels weighing 17,5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it at station on its final position.
After movehaving moved it, the crew started the redeployment of the solar panels of the module which have a scale of 76 meters.
And it is there that one of the panels, which are unfolded like accordions, was damaged on nearly one meter by a cable which was wedged.
The deployment was stopped not to damage the panel more.
The astronauts, who were at the origin to carry out an exit of control of the Discovery shuttle, then then to go to repair another solar panel whose system of rotation was defective, saw themselves constrained to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski which was selected to go caracoler at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out repair.
It is one of best "the spacewalker" (walker of space) of NASA.
Large, resistant, very skilful, it has the chest very developed and of long arms.
At 46 years, this doctor of formation was thus charged "to operate" the solar panel "wounded".
After having precisely inspected the damage, it divided the faulty cable and installed kinds of "splints" on the damaged zone.
It was helped by a second "spacewalker" remained close to the hopper and, of the interior, by the other astronauts of which Peggy Whitson, ordering it of the crew.
The tool which it used, a minicanne hockey wrapped of insulator to avoid electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundreds of volts, was designed and "arranged" by the astronauts on board station.
Once the finished operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel is entirely deployed before making an inventory of its tools and to regain the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts benefitted from one half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts do not regain the Discovery shuttle for a return on Earth envisaged Wednesday.
Title EADS sanctioned out of Stock Exchange
Action EADS is into clear fall currently with the Paris Bourse, after the group of aeronautics and defense announced that it was going to have to spend between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to face the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros with the Paris Bourse.
The group was obliged to re-examine its forecast of operational result for 2007 following the delays generated by the slow progression of the development of the engine of the A400M, which conditions the inaugural flight of the plane.
The cost to mitigate the delay taken in the delivery of sound of military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts ' ' between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus' ', announced the head office of European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these loads, EADS will be constrained to announce new objectives of turnover (EBIT) for 2007 at the time of the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds it without more quantified precise details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new loads is coherent with the delay of six months.
For recall, the operational result of EADS fell of 86% in 2006, primarily because of loads related to the delays of another program, that of the very large A380 transport aircraft.
Initially, the group envisaged a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the ballot boxes: the Russians will choose massively the party of president Putin, Russia plain.
Confirming their aspiration with stability, even with authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian president Vladimir Putin addresses today to the voters a message televised on the public chains, already recorded but whose contents are kept secret.
It does it in the capacity as chief candidate of linked Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced crushing.
Yesterday, the president let anything of it show through by receiving the foreign ambassadors, being satisfied to deliver a new load against the marked Occident of interference - his topic of predilection during the countryside.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish the honest elections, most transparent and the most opened, elections without tears", it added.
With the eyes of the opposition, one is far from the account.
It denounces a campaign sullied with pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there "never were such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the manifestations of last weekend, the ex-champion of the world of failures Garry Kasparov, condemned to five days of prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited of visit according to his lawyer.
"the Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus"
Behind these legislative without suspense two questions much more open are profiled:
- Which will succeed Putin with the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first tower of presidential, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make known itself.
Elected official in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot briguer a third consecutive mandate.
However no successor emerges.
- Which role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful plain Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
At all events, with legislative as with presidential, the outgoing capacity will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"the Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel main their destiny", estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the university of State de Saint-Pétersbourg, goes up further: the civil company took delay in this country christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the Nineties, "Putin joined again with the model of a paternalist State, accepted perfectly by the population more especially as this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease", Maria Lipman estimates, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "give up of full liking to the personal liability" of which they had briefly made proof after the bursting of the USSR.
"A what to reflect good?"
The phenomenon touches all the social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 chiefs of Russian areas) direct the local lists of plain Russia.
New imported freedoms of Occident are often synonymous with chaos, as in the Nineties.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of what the Russians will not vote either for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54 year old professor: "A what to reflect good?
Those which are with the capacity are not too bad, why change them? "

Significant information
The access of the historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to undertake research "in particular on displacements of the prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of the forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these files managed by the international Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, whose Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public these personal documents, because of the significant character of certain information.
Like supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of the deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or the warrants for arrest establish by Gestapo had been gathered after war with a practical aim: to find the civil deportees or subjected to obligatory work and, if required, to bring a proof of their internment to them, in order to open the way with their compensation.
Still today with Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees tens of thousands of individual requests treat.
However, for a part of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen revêt a limited interest.
"There is nothing basically again to await these documents", had declared in 2006 Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research center on the anti-semitism in Technische Universität of Berlin.

Will there be a rally of end of the year out of purse? Experts divided by the crisis of the sub-premiums.

Javier Barrio, person in charge for the sales of BPI in Spain, agrees on the fact that it is not the good moment for saying that there will be a rally.
"It is not the best thing", ensures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish index of security prices, lost nearly 4 % since November 8 when the index enclosed at 15.945,7 points.
However not all the experts have this so negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believe that Ibex 35 could enclose the year at 16.000 points thanks to the reorganization of the wallets and the contributions traditional with the modes of the retirements which occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert moderates that the things will be a little different this year since it believes that the rally will take place as from the second week of December, after the bridge of the festival of the Constitution (on December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, evaluate that we are close to the technical levels and "this is why we could observe a bounce of the index which could be caused according to information which arrives of the European Union with regard to the consequences of the crisis on the market of the appropriations".
The analyst hopes that those will be positive.
The analysts agree to choose the values which will be the persons in charge to carry out Ibex towards new maximum coats.
Solana, of Intermoney, affirms that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the wallet the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electric sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco ensures that the rises will be at the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructors will be able to also profit from this rally, if they are put at it.
"ACS for several months has recovered positions and we hope that the other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will suiveront the same way", explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in the sales in the season of sales of Christmas.
On another side, the expert believes that the technological companies will also do it very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times during seven years
During the seven last years, only during two occasions December was one month bear.
The authentic rally of end of the year took place in 2003, exercise during which the stock exchange markets left the crisis caused by the boring of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 %, the month of dicembre recorded a rise of 6,68 %.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 are the fifth consecutive year of the profits (for the moment Ibex increased by 8,36 % since January) and if it succeeds with computer on its rally of end of the year.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours of Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank decided to renovate a great part of its offices.
On the whole 200 are the banks located in the most commercial zones of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the mark Populaire max, represent for the bank a great change.
Also for remainder of organizations Spanish, since it is the first group which decided to start to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20h30, and to open saturdays of 10h with 20h30.
Another group which as reiterated several times as he would like to amplify the schedules of his branches, BBVA, even if he did not decide yet to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75 % of its agencies saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, but not with the public.
The results of the experiment of the Popular Bank will be decisive so that other organizations adhere or not to this initiative which coincides with the schedules of the trade.
It is precisely this objective which research the Popular Bank.
To attract the autonomous customers who circulate in these zones to make their purchases in SME and the trade of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies established on all Spain in approximately 18 months, since it acts not of the opening of new agencies but of a restoration of those already existing.
For that, the organization will modernize the branches which it already has in the commercial zones, by adapting them to the profile of the customers of the various streets.
By this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a design different from the interior of the branch and by a new design, more current, with more luminous colors.
The sales manager for bank, Ángel Will rivet, ensures that this restoration does not imply great investments, but the recruiting of personnel, since the number of employees will increase by six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces so that SME can meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experiment for the group
The Popular Bank already tested its initiative in three agencies of Madrid.
And the experiment was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains it.
The branches of Brave the Murillo streets, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and successfully apparement, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2.500 branches.
And 60 others which operate under the mark of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of the immigrants, also with very full schedules, which open even Sunday and the public holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a large range of non-financial products for its sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers ', notices Rivero.
For the moment, they arrived at an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile telephones, with an external personnel at the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock exchange security of its rival Antena 3
We arrived there.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a deputy adviser of Telecinco, its satisfaction expressed yesterday, with the fence of the stock exchange market, when it noted that the chain that it directs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished its joy: ' what hurts me, it is not the fact that we increased more but that we have less baissé', affirmed it.
However, it stressed the fact that on a weak market, ' we fell less '.
Telecinco finished yesterday the day with a progression of 2,54 %.
This profit has stabilized its loss to 15,66 % for one year.
The stock exchange security of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13 % moreover) thus reached the 4.488,88 million euros, according to data's of Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, who yielded 1,52 % yesterday and which accumulates a fall of 40,5 % since January, costs half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other companies of comunication dimensioned out of Stock Exchange rises to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in that of Snuffed (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is with the fact that ' we speak about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to make, on the same market, at which price and how we make profitable it in terms of audience '.
Telecinco announced last week which it envisages to become this year the first chain of television to exceed the 1.000 million rough advertising incomes, like Giuseppe Tringali, the deputy adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña ensured, the subsidiary company which manages the publicity of the group.
So that this announced data is real, the chain of television should record for the current year an increase of 3,6 % in its invoicing for publicity compared to the 965,4 million the exercise of 2006.
For its part, the clear invoicing of Antenna 3 increased by 1,6 % in the first nine months of the exercise (until reaching the 734,4 million) while the incomes Nets of television increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors which the annalists point for the best relative evolution of Telecinco out of Stock Exchange is important the pay out than it maintained until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100 % of the benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol and in partnership with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise to give for tiny 50 %, although we always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make content our shareholders, with those to which we already gave titles with 33 % of Endemol '.
According to analysts', the market gives in this moment of the signs of tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of the benefit on Telecinco in 2008 to 4 % and 2009, to 7 %.
That is due, explain, with the fall of the growth envisaged of the incomes of 10,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and of 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
This same company decreased the forecast of the profits of Antenna 3 to 4,5 % in 2008 and to 7,5 % in 2009.

Martínez Andreo replaced it to me May last Juan Morales, current deputy of right-hand side, and hitherto city council man town hall, and which according to sources' of the investigation consulted by Chain SER, could be the ' meneur' of this screen.
The agents continue to excavate the municipal buildings and those of the council of Town planning and one does not draw aside the possibility of new stops in the next hours.
Moreover, the lawyer of Juan Morals, principal suspect of the screen of corruption urbane, discovered at the beginning of this semine, was charged.
As yesterday Chain SER indicated it to lawyer of the deputy ' of the party populaire' Juan Morales, one stopped it while leaving the residence of Morals with important documentation in his posséssion relating to the screen.
Moreover, according to sources' of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the cashing supposed of commissions of Morals in exchange to facilitate the signature of an urban agreement with a company constructor of the galice to requalify 200 hectares of ground.

Bono agrees to be with the head of the candidature of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède and to chair the Congress if they gain the elections
The ex-minister of Bono Defense accepted the offer of the president of the Government and of the secretary-general of the Socialists, Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be with the chief candidate of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède for the next general elections and to be a president of the Congress if the Socialists gain the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, Blanco, and Bono him even announced it during a press conference after the meeting which took place this midday with the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the Executive justified quoted to the ex-minister because "it is important to count on the best" in the political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, it stressed that "yes it seems" which the politician of the English Channel will be the candidate of the socialist group which will chair the Congress if the Socialists will gain the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín like chair Congress, which this last made public on 15 November last its decision not to arise at the prochainess general elections and to give up its political career to devote itself to the fight against the climatic change within the university framework.
The ex-minister recognized that the president of the Government did not stop insisting that it returns to the political avant-garde since it gave up it two years ago.
Moreover, it pointed out that, even if the citizens know already who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party gains the elections, his party wanted to announce that who will chair the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If it reaches the station, Bono hopes to transform the Room into "a house of the respect and not of the insult or cry" and to make that "it resembles to the citizens more and more".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the single room of Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government to the Senate in certain occasions has éte stopped 26 times".
Same manner, it had words of praise for its current president, Manuel Marín and "its knowledge to make" and it did not want to make as if it occupied already his station not to fall, as it pointed out, in what its adversaries could regard as "a domination".
A climatic propaganda
Since the movement against the climatic change as well subjects to a persecution without mercy the skeptics of its predictions as those which gives priority to other political and social battles, it must show an iron coherence.
It is all the more the case for a leader of the movement which is a president of the Government like Zapatero and which believes that this fight is more important than that of islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for planet".
This approach obliges it to explain why the action, or the inaction, of its Government contributed in a decisive way so that Spain is with the head of the European Union in the non-éxecution of the protocols of Kyoto.
Who are the persons in charge for the non-éxecution, in which sectors it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with planet, did not avoid it.
Moreover, it must explain clearly to the Spaniards which are measurements which it will take to slow down the climatic change.
Which companies will be affected, which practices of the citizens will have to be changed, which individual and collective energy economies will be us obliged to make, which economic consequences that will cause it.
I.e., which will be sacrificed and which will pay to save planet.
But there was not and there will not be aucunes explanations.
Precisely because it is a question of being sacrificed and to pay.
Measurements against the climatic change, real measurements, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and menaçantes on behalf of the companies and of the individuals.
Until the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed to him so dangerous electoralmente with Zapatero which it hastened to deny it.
I.e. that it is a question of saving planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences which have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new stations.
With these contracts with planet, this so useful Mister for the election campaigns which does not speak, which does not denounce and which does not require, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that that is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting part and which does not claim so that we move in the bicycle or we refresh itself with the range.
The mayor and the chief of the local Police force of Totana stopped for a supposed screen of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie stopped the mayor of the locality murcian of Totana, "popular" Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local Police force, the secretary of the Town hall and a contractor hôtellier suspects for urban possible offences, informed today of the sources of the investigation.

Only one person thus was stopped in Totana, all things considered, the owner of a company of avicolous products very known in the area, which could have played the part of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was the person in charge for the development of the greatest residential complex of the common murcian of Totana, which would imply the construction of more than 5.000 residences, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Penal code of the offences on the remote loadings on Internet:
With. The remote loading of a song would be an offence liable to a six months sorrow to one year.
On the other hand, the flight in a store of cds for a value lower than 400 euros, is regarded only as one fault (article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value up to 1.000 euros is already regarded as an offence, but the sorrow is lower than that imposed for the remote loading (article 234 of the Penal code).
C. If you steal a car and you return it 40 hours after, the sorrow is lower than that imposed for the remote loading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to take part in a brawl than to take part in the traffic of compact discs.
To take part in a tumultuous brawl implies a three months sorrow to one year (article 154 of the Penal code) and the traffic of cds would imply a six months sorrow to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal code).

My attending practitionar spoke to me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: ' the money produces cerebral activations, especially if the others receive less '.
I.e., that the feelings which the monthly pay of the workers generates depends on what the colleagues gain.
The study was carried out thanks to tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of the images of neurocognition of the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his/her companion failed".
The researchers observed that when the two people guessed that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was larger.
I do not know if this conclusion required such an amount of science.
The prosecutor of Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years has implacably continued the war criminals of Balkans since the public ministry of the Penal Court for ex-Yugoslavia, which is in the Hague.
Its mandate finishes at the end of the year and Carla from will go away with a bitter taste, because the principal persons in charge for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8.000 Moslems bosniens died -, the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the ex-leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still in freedom.
Their names are in this list whose documentary one of the Swiss realizer Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, ' the list of Carla ' (2006, not projected of exclusiveness in Spain), with the rate/rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York which continues the criminals in escape and fact pressure on the implied governments so that they narrow the circle.
Which insurance is it appropriate to me?
The automobile insurance, which covers the driver vis-a-vis with possible disasters, implies an important expenditure which will depend on various factors, such as the age, the sex, the seniority of the driving licence, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use that one in fact, inter alia.
To have a car it is the main thing.
Y be that, escoger el seguro automóvil adecuado are incluso más difícil that to elegir el modelo of vehículo.
And it is that, to choose the adequate automobile insurance, is even more difficult than to choose the model of the vehicle.
The insurance car is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes by a contract of insurance, which establishes that the company receives the value of the granted premium and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of disaster.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established by holding account of various factors, such as the age, the sex, the seniority of the driving licence, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the usageque one one in fact, inter alia.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that the higher the probability of undergoing an accident is, the more the dimension to be poured is high.
For this reason the people of more than 25 years and the women must pay lower premiums, since the statistics show that these persones has a lower rate of disasters of to their prudence.
Same manner, while being useful of the censuses, the companies concluded that the married people tend to have less accidents than the unmarried drivers.
The use which one makes of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
They are numerous the variables which the insurers hold in account at the time to establish the price of the premium.
It is for that, that the driver must study the situation well to choose the automobile insurance which adapts best to its profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that this one, in more of adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price to him.
The young people of less than 25 years must deal with various disadvantages at the time to sign a contract with an insurance at an accessible price, like can be the weak experiment in the control and the seniority of the driving licence.
Although the ideal to be quite assured is an insurance at any risk, other more economic options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can choose a comprehensive insurance with frankness, so that they obtain the covers of an insurance at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the disaster.
"the part of the amount of the disaster which the customer pours will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher plus the amount will be weak", specifies Luis Noguera, the person in charge in Spain de First Europa, mediator of insurances online.
Another option is the insurance with third widened, so that the customer ensures protection to face damage caused with thirds, but by for those caused on its own car.
Moreover, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A council.
If you are 25 year old a minor try to be careful and to avoid the disasters as far as possible, since that will be reflected on the allowance, being able to reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
An allowance is a reduction of the basic tariff which the company has.
On the contrary, a sanction is an increase of the basic tariff.
"the allowances and the sanctions will depend on the company and the profit of this one.
If the company had a good year it will be able to be allowed to increase the allowances ", Noguera clears up.
Beyond the 25 years that becomes easier for the drivers at the time to sign a contract with an insurance, since the rate of disasters is tiny room thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason it is preferable to choose a comprehensive insurance with frankness.
"Normally the young people cannot benefit from the experiment as a preliminary acquired after an accident", ensure the director of the European company in Spain and add that the majority of the accidents occur during the second year of control, once last ' fear of the beginner '.
However, if the customer is married but children yet it does not have is preferable that it negotiates an insurance at any risk, momento that its economic situation allows him.
The marriages with children are considered by the insurers as being the people with the lowest rate of disasters, because increases will be weaker.
In this case the best insurance would be an insurance at any risk with frankness (being able to be of 300 euros), or an insurance with third widened as from the third year of life of the vehicle when the policy-holder has a high level of allowance.
"They have more relaxed control and they have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to assume a larger quantity of franknesses", judge Luis Noguera.
For the pensioners an insurance at any risk with frankness is preferable (while being this one of 150 euros), or a widened asurance with third when the insurer has a high level of allowance.
It should be said that the automobile insurance is something of important, not only because it covers the driver vis-a-vis with possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, it is for that that it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance which is appropriate to us more according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to gain a point in Milan to arrive at the eighth of finale
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow measure next Tuesday with San Siro with the research of the point which misses to them to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the Champions, since it is used to the Italians to be first and to the Scot to classify itself.
Italians add up ten points and they are already qualified during fifth day thanks to match null with Portugal, whereas Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it has still need for another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, which has six of them, and which receives Benfica which has four of them, does not pass to him in front.
These two matches of the Group D will be played one week before the sixth day finishes, since Milan AC must dispute the semifinales World cup of the Clubs in Japan 13 this month in the search of a place for the finale of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the stage Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the result more awaited, although the two teams will try to leave victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate on their premises and Celtic Glasgow knows that while gaining there would remain first and a better crossing in the eighth would be ensured of finale.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be sufficient to be classified if Shakhtar Donetsk does not gain, but it will not be able computer only on that since with nine points the plays returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but which gained (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milaneses will try to poison the evening with the Scot, who have good hope to be classified for the eighth of finale for the second time at the League Champions, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the ' rossoneri' the triumph would return only in Shakhtar, if Celtic would lose, to be classified for the eighth of finale to be able to continue the league of the champions of the UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities of continuing the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.

The new gas business between Russia and the Ukraine throws alarm.
An argument on the price of gas ferments between the Ukraine and Russia, increasing thus, the risks of repercussions on fuel exports towards Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports towards the European Union (U.E) are convoyed by gas pipelines, and each conduit is scrupulously supervised.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase the taxes of transit in Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two, had caused a reduction in the supplies towards the countries of the U.E.
The last argument between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, company of monopoly of property of Russia providing gas, tested in vain, to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to the Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom declared that it would increase as envisaged, its prices in the Ukraine considering which it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% of more for the gas supply coming from the Turkménistan neighbor.
The analysts declared that that would comprise for the Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of the imports coming from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which the majority of gas forward," the Ukrainian Minister for the Economy announced, Anatoly Kinkh at service Reuters the news.
"the fluctuations of the costs of gas would undoubtedly be related to our discussions in connection with the taxes of transit (towards Western Europe) via the Ukraine"
The last great dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of the supplies of Gazprom intended for the Ukraine.
That involved the fall of exports towards Western Europe, increasing by consequence the prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has largest gas stocks, even if the majority of them under are still developed.
By consequence, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas coming from Turkménistan and other nations of the ex Soviet Union in the Central Asia.
The ministry for health ' must control its employees étrangers'.
The Scottish ministry for health must improve controls to be carried out on its Community extra employees to check if they have penal precedents, declared the committee of control.
The warning of the General Reviser, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was implied in the attack with the airport of Glasgow of June.
Mr. Black moreover, expressed his concern on the fact that the ministry for health shelled overseas does not have any precise data on the number of people whom it employs.
His report/ratio all the same highlighted the other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of medical employees of five authorities.
The general reviser made controls on the Community extra personnel following the attack of the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years, doctor of Iraqi extraction to the service of the Royal Hospital Alexandra de Paisley, was stopped with the airport after having dark with its jeep, in the doors of the principal terminal.
It made party of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, bus suspectés to be implied in various attempts at explosion of cars in the United Kingdom.
The ministry for health will have to carry out controls pre employment on the personnel overseas, to be certain validity of their qualifications, experiments, and work permit for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish ministry for health use Disclosure Ecossaise to carry out controls of penal precedents, the agency does not have any right to obtain from such information out of the United Kingdom.
Among the many warnings, the report/ratio of the general reviser declares now that the committees are held to confront itself with the Office of control of penal precedents, thus allowing, with the employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we discovered that certain information concerning the personnel was indeed checked, that is not done with each time" announces the report/ratio.
Mr. Black declared that the Scottish ministry for health carries out the majority of controls pre employment which it would make itself, but it also added: "our report/ratio highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to guarantee that adequate information on certain members of the personnel overseas is available to the medical services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland declared that it is "extremely improbable" that controls pre employment can identify the employees likely to make future terrorist acts.
It A declares "the report/ratio suggests that controls pre employment currently carried out, function well in the medical system shelled and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish medical authorities stated to overseas employ 1161 people, made up for the majority of doctors and nurses.
But the general reviser stressed that these figures must certainly be re-examined with the rise, partly because of the problems relating to the identification of the members of the personnel equipped with contract at unspecified duration, who could choose or not, to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that current procedures of controls of the medical authorities with Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are completely adequate.
These controls are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government revises in this moment its policy and its system of controls pre employment for the members of the personnel in addition to ocean of the medical service.
The secretary with Health Nicola Sturgeon declared: "I was enthusiastic to complete this work following the terrorist attack with the airport of Glasgow"
It added that the Government shelled allied at the medical committees would consider carefully the warnings stated in the report which should be published the next month, and would commit themselves guaranteeing recently a better execution of controls pre updated employment, and valid for all the employees, including the people overseas.

The television of state of the largest world oil exportor, declared that one of the cells of smugglers of missiles.
The Al Qaeda sympathizers put in scene a campaign against monarchy allied at the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell made up of eight militants, directed by a foreign resident planned an attack against an oil site in the Eastern Province, declared the newspaper TV.
Saudi Arabia quickly set up a group of 35.000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006, against the greatest oil site with Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoting a declaration of the Minister of Interior Department, declared that 18 of the stopped people belong to a cell directed by a "expert of launching of missiles" which infiltrated in the country.
It is said that the militants planned counters it band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the prisoners would seem to have plotted the assassination of ecclesiastics and armed forces.

The Venus climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists declared yesterday that Venus was certainly a planet pleasant to live.
The data resulting from the European vessel in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice smaller than the Earth, as opposed to what one thought before.
Venus is the planet more close to the Earth.
These two worlds are practically of the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
The scientists believe now that it there of the billion years, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could have even been livable.
But the effect tightens due to the carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion which had with allied solar radiations with a slower rotation led Venus towards very another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is private of water, is devastated by hurricanes and storms of flashes and has a surface of enough hot temperature to melt lead there.
The discoveries of Come Express train, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied planet during one year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to the catastrophic changes of the climate.
The professor of the department of physics of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of Come the Express train, declared: "we start to include/understand the reason for which the Venus climate is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets in them even are practically similar.
"Our new data enable us to establish a scenario according to which there is billion years, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, can be even with a livable surface"
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police force.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently of uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovakian and Hungarian police force yesterday.

Still opened with all
Mitt Romney stated not to be with the height like candidate with the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowman.
In spite of that, the republican candidates with the presidency finally agreed to take part in the debate of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters having recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening November 28, none the put questions was as ridiculous as that resulting from another debate of You Tube, when a snowman required of the democrats their position compared to the reheating of planet.
But this time Ci, the questions and the answers reflected the conditions of the republican party much, candidate with the next elections.
One does not know oneself on which criteria, the producers of CNN, which has sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to be shown to the candidates candidates.
But the first half the hour of the debate, longest approaching of only one topic, was focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects the forts for the Republicans.
CNN required of certain voters to telephone when they would hear pleasant things: The control concerned the rises of approval when the candidates expressed in a coarse way.
The hardest exchange and longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national face, and Mr. Romney who is at the head of the important anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that it was accommodating in connection with clandestine immigration at the time of his mandate of mayor of New York.
It attacked Mr. Romney, showing the ex governor of Massachusetts, to employ clandestine immigrants at his place.
The two combatants became particularly wild when it was asked to them whether they would be ready to promote a "amnésia" (offering to clandestine regular statute and the possibility of becoming citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, succeeded in looking further into this subject.
None them has the possibility of being elected, but both remain in the race, can be thanks to the fact that they started to fight immigration before and in way plus incisor that the others.
In a general way, the candidates, at least concerning immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and tolerance zero for the clandestine immigrants.
This subject, combined with the concerns caused in particular by the business of the toxic toys manufactured in China, or of other fears towards the external world, support the Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between the catholic libertarians and conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other subjects were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why it had before supported the countryside for the control of weapons.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed to know if to put water in the nose should be regarded as a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in his totality, the contents of the Bible.
That led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is its preferred book, even if it is not on believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
One did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa at the time of a recent election, thanks to its Christian conservatism of long date - to declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When one insisted to know if Jesus would have been in favour, it started to laughing and declared that Jesus is too smart to present himself at the elections.
The human race remains open to all insolitement.
The increase of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with recent extraordinary research of subsidies carried out by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles at the time of the debate of Wednesday.
These two there are emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that both protected from the party are not able to agree to decide which are the candidate more known and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and in a convincing way thanks to a message of success on the American size bringing closer the leaders thus.
This time Ci, the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
Pains of the Members of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; Even if it resigned, the situation would not change.
Considering the tendency of the British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, nor invoices of Parisian hotel of politicians, not of sucked marital extra toe.
But here is that a revelation attests that a rich person businessman would have masked during four years, under false names, his contributions to current Labour Parti, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle from which Gordon Brown would have occurred well from there.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went into reverse in his project of election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly proclaiming that the opinion polls did not influence its decision, and that it hoped on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the democratic brilliance liberal leader, declared that terrifying it Mr. Brown changed of Stalin with Mr. Bean.
The repurchase of Northern Rock'n'roll, a bank in difficulty at the edge of the ace, showed a fault of the directives and a poor judgement in the event of urgency.
The inadequate proposals in favour of the change of the code of the taxes caused a coalition of the industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 personal million data on behalf of the authorities of the taxes, revealed an incredible administrative boob.
A trio of Generals to the retirement launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of the military expenditure: they proclaimed that to be a Minister for defense is for them, a part-time employment.
At present, the suspicion of donations have a cast on behalf of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary-general of the Members of the Labour Party (and his ex chief of vigilance) made that they had to resign.
Nothing of that means that Mr. Brown moves inevitably towards the exit.
However the governments can arrive at a point where it would be impossible to control.
People do not love the politicians, and do not rely on them, but in general leave their doubts of with dimensions at the time a new government arrives at the capacity.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve the things, nor to even control for a long time, at the time which it risks the suspension: the public administration does not function any more; the cabinets of the ministers make the assessment; the press seeks bad stories; and the government becomes on the defensive and without more any objective.
In a direction, the position of Mr. Brown is particularly difficult, because contrary to other leaders policy, it cannot be praised to be initial.
Although it would wish to repudiate Tony Blair, he was his higher lieutenant all the same.
The problems relating to Northern Rock'n'roll and the data of the taxes for example, are related to the made decisions of Mr. Brown when he was a chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if it is not directly implied in misfortunes of Blair, the such long investigation into the funds of the party "of the money cash for the members of the House of Lords", the voters could think the opposite.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown incurs is not so tragic that it has the air of it.
The blunders are not so monstrous as the members of the party of Tories make it believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim nor swindle.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to concretize the tendencies Stalinist of Mr. Brown of always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on the political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compares his donations with charity, declared that it did not wish any public recognition of his benevolence.
It can have its opinion, but is not with him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the large subventionneurs of the politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those which will control the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated to be with the current of the programs of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing that that was illegal, will have by consequence questioned being, in the same way moreover as Jon Mendlesohn, the person in charge for the collections of subsidies who had spoken about the doubtful donations in October.
But up to now Mr. Brown is not implied: Nothing lets think that it was with the current as of the these steps, even if the majority of the payments carried out were done following its arrival with the government in June.
Up to now the Prime Minister made half.
It quickly condemned the legislative fault of its party, but it did not draw the attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on a trick which he connait well, to make recourse to an investigating committee on this subject made up of one bishop to the retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law were ridiculed, it is spring of the police force.
Moreover, there have been well other things that Mr. Brown must make, such as finding a president permanent for the committee independent of the public Standards of living, without leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on financially political parties.
That would oblige the Travailliste party, in one moment of weakness, to collaborate with Tories, which could lead it to give up his particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such Mr. Brown.
But it should face certain facts in favour.
The party of the conservatives now has a good advantage for the elections; it is two years old to reconquer the voters, and the only way of obtaining a victory is to show an irreproachable integrity and solids competences.
Swindles of charts.
Would the crisis of the mortgages contaminate the American market of the credit cards?
When there is blood in water, it is normal to see poked fins, to whirl around.
Now that the market of the American real estate crosses a critical phase, the predatory ones aim to the American market of the credit cards.
The analysts from Goldman Sachs think that the losses related to the credit cards could reach $ 99 billion if the contagion extends from the mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rises in the rates of the expenses and insolvency, which measures the nonrecoverable shares of the assessment or which are it, more than 30 days afterwards.
HSBC announced last month which it took $ 1.4 billion in its appropriations with the consumer, partly because of the weakness of the card holders.
It is all the same too early to panic.
The expenses and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3,89% of the troixième quarter is lower of almost a point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of the rates is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change of the laws in 2005 in the United States, concerning the personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall of the files of bankruptcy, which in its turn caused heavy losses for the credit cards; the number of files (and thus of rates of insolvency) could increase even if the conditions of loans were to worsen.
Industry announces moreover fixed rates of payment, which highlight the sum of monthly debt that the consumers must regulate.
and confidence in sureté of the capital of the credit cards is rather strong in spite of the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney de TowerGroup, a company of research, predicted that the volume of emission for 2007 will be 25% superior at last year.
The direct bonds of infection between the crisis of the mortgages and the market of the credit cards exist certainly: the consumers could prefer to increase their debts now that the equitable real loans disappeared.
But the transmitters of charts rather pay more attention to flow of species than to the value of the inheritance, and thus the fall of the prices of the real estate inevitably did not involve a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even bring advantages to the transmitters of titles of credit.
The premiums with the consumers for the payment of the mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; by consequence, the debt by credit card would become a priority to pay again the whole.
The transmitters of charts are able to answer much more quickly than the mortage holders and with more flexibility such conditions of crisis, because they can change the interest rates or deteriorate the limits of rédit.
That should in theory reduce the risk to have a fast resumption of the actions.
"We will not awake we one morning and to revalue all the loans" declared Gary Perlin, the director of One Capital.
If a financial catastrophe of the market of the credit cards is improbable, there are strong risks to have a consequent fall.
If the lower prices of the real estate and a contraction in the market of the credit bring America towards the recession, industry will have certainly to face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the dorsal fins well.
The British bankers plead guilty for the case Enron.
The three British bankers who were to go to testify their roles compared to a fraud made by the preceding financial director to Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their declaration, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared himself innocent of the seven charges for fraud supposed collusive in 2000, made by Fastow in a secret financial swindle in order to grow rich with the spite by their employees.
They should be presented at the court in January.
But during an audience chaired by American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they declared all guilty to have made a fraud.
The three ex frameworks of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary company of group PLC of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous everywhere in the United Kingdom because of the procedures of extraditions which lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains still a question outstanding for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges which were inflicted to them in 2002, made include/understand in Fastow which it was the object of the investigation of the government in the rout of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, called the "three of Natwest" declare being come in Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and its ex right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary company of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the director many fraudulent scenarios, which helped it àtruquer the procedures of bankruptcy.
With the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest for the subsidiary company like null, but makes the three British of them know already his value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the bank of the subsidiary company for £ 1 million.
The bankers paid $ 250.000 in Kopper like interest for this company.
According to shows, Fastow would have wrongfully announced in Enron that the company of energy was to lay out to pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the subsidiary company.
But in truth this $20 million went in the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others still.
According to charges', the bankers would have obtained $7.3 whereas Fastow, Kopper and the others would have gained $ 12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pled guilty for its active role in two conspiracies in the rout of Enron.
The British trio was stopped three months afterwards.
Fastow endures a six years imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a guarantee of $ 1million each, which oblige them to live in the United States during the lawsuit.
Enron, before seventh larger company national, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after countable years of fakings, could not hide its billion debt any more nor to even propose its speculations can like profitable.

The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the ex general president Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year, for their implication in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was condemned to more than 24 years of prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offences were useless because of its death due to a heart attack last year.

"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche" Miss Yumatova declared, who seized her dress of haute couture a such veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems above all to aim to the new rich person, the kind of Russian purchasers of marks laid out to make the tail in the stoppers to come to an immense warehouse where are exposed of Cadillac Escalades, of the platinium penknives, the Mövenpick ices, the personalized billiard tables, the apartments to and of the teddy bear Gund.
The public could buy the bills for 30 euros ($44.57).
"the Russians are interested to define the most expensive marks and the best" declared Mr. Gijrath, posing proudly sitted with the stand of Royal factory of manufacture of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a mural table of Raimbrant on blue squares, hand made.
"it is certain that Russian is interested in the bling bling"
Indeed, the salesmen declared here that Russian having of the old capital (10 to 15 years too are according to Russian standards') already passed from the logos bright to a kind of mark to limited edition which could not be sold with the living room.
In spite of that, thousands of people, is millionaires, emissary millionaires or tourists, survey the exposure tous.les.jours.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exposure, last Thursday, Romance Ershow, the chairman of the beds King Koil, stated to have sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton encrusted with gold wire.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motor bike, a company which equips the cars with warning systems the last cry, also stated to him to have sold to a Russian millionaire, orange Porsche shining, for $ 170.000.
By Sunday after midday, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company which personalizes the luxury cars, declared that it would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, to $ 55.000 each one.
It showed a receiver, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, which wanted that it is encrusted with Swarovski crystals so that it resembles a wheel of caster.
The set of four costs $ 22.000.
"the Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of leather of ostrich, or a photograph of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not lead inevitably with such tires" declared Mr. Karapetian.
It certainly will keep it in its garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles "
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian declared that the expression "millionaire Russian" is not on the agenda, considering the raising of prices of the real estate here.
"if you had bought an apartment in Moscow there are three or four years, you would be already millionaire, at least on paper, if it is not in species" it declared.
"there is more than you could think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the Continental stand of Alliance, a Russian company of patrimonial management.
The company set up four stands representing the British phone boxes, filled with mass of dollars of counterfeit.
Azad Karryev, the director marketing of the company, declared that its team printed 500.000 counterfeit bills for the Millionnaire living room.

"you see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire", declared Mr. Karyev.
Surgeon not approved suspecté of homicide in the New Jersey
It was the day before of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked by picture window of the Just restaurant has little Healthier and observed an ambulance which had just stopped with the doors of the white Cape Cod on the avenue West Scott.
Then the patrol of the police force arrived.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stopping" Mr. Livingston, a person in charge for the restaurant, declared Wednesday.
It is there that I realized that somebody was deceased.
The authorities would learn then that the person deceased was a 41 years old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant of the director of the department of Newark police force.
Maintaining the investigators try to determine if the cause of its death must with a gesture carried out by a cosmetic surgeon not approved, that the police force did not identify yet, resident to the 212 of the avenue West Scott.
The authorities did not determine yet the causes of the death of Miss Arroyo, but they wait trustful, the results of the toxicological tests which, alas will take time, but which should make it possible to solve this mysterious death which saddened the high rows of the police force of Newark.
Miss Arroyo was the assistant of the director of the police force, Garry F Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and its voice was well-known in various departments.
It was honest, large worker and tough ", Mr. McCarthy declared in connection with Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview, Wednesday"
"it was like a pit bulldozer"
"it would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy declared that Miss Arroyo was married in Jimmy Arroyo, a ex senior police officer of Newark which worked for the Audit Board of Alcoholic Beverages, and which it leaves two wire of 14 and 11 years, as well as a daughter-in-law.

Two mountain bikes hung on the with dimensions ones.
McCarthy declared that since its arrival with Newark 25 years ago, at the Department of Police force of New York, Miss Arroyo was extremely invaluable, helping it to sail in the new city and to give up its framed political culture.
"she said" you must pay attention to this with that "told it.
"it was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rates related to the effervescence of the world purse.
The actions are exploded of the two with dimensions ones of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the conditions of the credit, reducing later on the interest rates promoted by the alleviating declarations of the vice president of the American central bank.
The stock exchange markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, n° 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, declared that those which decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets considering these new tensions related to the credit, Mr. Kohn declared that recent turbulence partly "reversed certain improvements in the operation of the market at the end of September and October.
If this hard turbulence was to persist, that would increase the probabilities of a later rigidity of the financial conditions for the owners and the companies, At it declared.
These comments appear to the investors as an obvious signal which the Federal Reserve is ready to inject of new capital in the American markets, and which later reductions in the interest rates could stabilize the credit terms.
These remarks also made it possible to calm Wall Street with news even worse on the American economy, such as the largest fall of real sales for October.
Reflected of this financial tumult was accentuated following the declaration of Bear Stearns, banks of investment, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, i.e., 4% of its personnel, to reduce the expenses to compensate for the heavy losses which had with the bets losers of the real loans.
20 stations only are envisaged in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow-Jones increased by 331 points, that is to say 2,55% conclusive with 13.289,40 whereas the largest index, S&P 500, took 2,65%.
In London, index FTSE 100 took 165,5 points is 2,7% conclusive with 6306,2 adding more than 39£ to the value of the British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2,6% and the French CAC40 took 2,3%.
Previously, the reappearance of the difficulties of the credit in the markets was highlighted following the keen demand of an auction sale of tri funds monthly resulting by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to the European trade banks at the heavy rate of 4,7%, highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject later funds in the London financial markets causing tensions of the credit, made that the rates of loans tri monthly "LIBOR" the British banks, caused their higher growth since last September, to 6,59% continuation a strong increase since November 12.
England faces a call with the judgement compared to criticisms of Owais Shah and charm Bopara.
We are vis-a-vis with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the beater n°6 for England with Kandy this week end, Owais Shah or Who charmed Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, which will make the decision?
The second question is important bus David Graveney, the president of the selectors which was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, trainer chief, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, Chairman and managing Director of England, starts to fill the application forms to become a national selector, at least share time.
That which will not manage to gain the number n°6 will be unlucky person, but the life is often unjust and the sport is also.
It is never easy to destroy what makes it possible to a man to arrive at the signal of its profession while another never arrives in addition to the lower level, sometimes for lack of chance more than for lack of ability.
There is not only with the cricket which the selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgement remains subjective.
To make emerge Bopara is the good moment?
Is this right compared to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new frameworks having obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is of place only for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketor unless at least a chance is granted to him?
The figures have their importance in the decisions, but also opportunities.
At the interior of a team, a cricketor must capture the?il of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the one day old cricketor.
But to capture the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Much better did last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison were declared in full form and continued entrainer to be useful.
Anderson took 32 doors of first class on 33 lathes to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same average, but both already lived their moment of glory on the greatest level and hope to still offer.
If that will be Shah or Bopara which will play at the Asgiriya stage, that is only one question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but that done little difference.
There is four years, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and succeeded well in the first, with five useful doors and 40 turns, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, which succeeded in becoming the paramount cricketor of the Test, and that, in spite of the fact that its double hundred marked against Australia in Australia can under be still estimated.
The probability provides that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after the session of today at the Asgiriya stage, will follow certainly their preserving instincts and will support the greatest experiment of Shah against the exubérance of the Bopara young person.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliance and considerable beginning with the innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first class against six for Bopara, which with 22ans is seven years young person, and its excellent classification with launching.
But Shah made only ten turns at the time from his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Lord Test, his town of player of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again forms some, claimed its place for the next match, seems to have afflicted its so obvious dashes in Bombay.
Contrary to him, the player of Essex is full with joy in life.
Nothing frightens him on a ground of cricket and it exaggerated when it was recently hooded on a 4x4 at the time of a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It deferred only light wounds, was shocked, even if the first thing which it has fact were to take its Vodafone (sponsor well on) and to call Alastair Cook, its team-member which looked at it by far, to ask him S "' it had seen that? "
Bopara is the best beater by far, its slipping by pace enables him to make services which suit him, and which it beats with confidence and professionnality.
To choose the man right is a thing, to choose the good moment is another.
Is this can be the true art of the selection?
I would be favourable to give his chance to Bopara, which does not want to say that Shah should not apply if, the such sheets of tea suggest it, it will be him which will play this week end.
The buses bring back people to work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first bus filled of Iraqi refugees coming from Syria arrived to Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiled without money or renewals of visa, or others still which hope that the city found normality.
Some returned to fight against the militants who moved away them from on their premises.
At the station of bus Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozen bus of the official government, the terminal was filled of refugees of Syria and Jordan which returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors with Baghdas" declared Sabah Al-Qubaisi, Doctor Sunni.
"I returned today because I saw with tele and read in the newspapers what occurred to Baghdâd and considering the city is sourer now"
"They say that the Mahdi army does not commit any more crimes! "it declared, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada Al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the moment.
Qassim Al Atwani, a Shia teacher 38 years of the zone of Amariyah dominated by Sunni, returned with his/her two children, because it could not renew its Syrian visa any more and bus the mode prevents Iraqi from working.
Its neighbors of Shia with Amariyah called it it to inform that the militia helped by the United States, allowed to drive out Al Qaeda of the west of the capital, and invited it to return.
One of the newcomers of Jordan is the chief of a tribe Sunni and Shia which had to leave its house in the north of Baghdâd because of an attack to the grenade after it encouraged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But it was to return to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and said to me to have set up a militia anti Al-Qaeda at Sleikh, and that they had need for me and of my boys"
"For this reason I return today" declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years.
Many says to have attracted by the increasing lull of the capital since the American troops arrived, and with the sight of continuous training of "groups of implied citizens" well armed and collaborating with the American soldiers to defend their vicinity.
But still of others say to be obliged to return because of the problem of visa and of the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqi have flees the last years.
Salaam Al-Samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all in connection with the visas for exiled that Nouri Al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two million and half of people would have flees of the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
"we did not have a problem until Al-Maliki comes to Syria and encourages the government not to more give visas to Iraqi, to force them to return to Iraq" declared the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government which supports the criminals who burned my house when I left".
The fall of violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis were driven out zones of Shia and vice versa, creating places where the tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not increase the sectarian tensions again and bring back the engagements.
The small Saar, good formation.
The smallest federate State carries out as regards professionelle formation, and shines even from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one field that a deficit weighs on the of the Saar ones, similar to that of the remainder of the country.
"I exliqué yesterday for the 50ème time at not-of the Saar, which we are not of French" - it is the slogan which the smallest federated state, by autodérision, posts for its 50ème birthday.
On this level, France and Luxembourg play a great part in the system of formation of the Saar, system which is placed fifth in the monitor of the formations of the Institute of German saving in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with the close countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrucken in 1948 by French.
So far, the students have the possibility of finishing their studies by a double there, even triple diploma.
In the quotitée high one testifies to 15,6 percent of foreign students.
The Saar leads it in addition also the children of the country to the higher schools in a number higher than the average - much of them without a diploma of Gymnasium.
"In the Saar, one benefits from the system of vocational training", known as Axel Plünnecke, expert in formation at IW.
More than one young person out of five obtains his title of studies in a vocational school, thus the Saar is located at more than seven points at the top of the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of a vocational training and academic are relatively well developed.
Within sight of the number of inhabitants, the panel of double course is second the best of Germany.
In spite of a hands-on training and an increasing demand, the number of diplomés in engineering however fell by a third in the last years.
For this reason the Ministry for education of the Saar obliged the schools higher than a marketing campaign in the matters of engineerings.
"After the first studies RAMMED, we celebrated a great number of reforms in the general schools", known as a spokesman of the Ministry for education.
Thus the government introduced into all the federate state of the tests of comparison.
So that the children earlier start to learn, the last year of crêche is free from right - a model that meanwhile of other federate states copy too.
Only of future comparative studyes will be able to show if the performances of the pupils improve in a durable way.
In the studies RAMMED in 2003, the share of pupils at the risk was reduced from 29 to 20 percent.
On the whole however, the Saar did not improve as much as other federate states.
The Bavarian ones are left there better.
And with the great spite of of the Saar, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by the studies RAMMED - one could if not to gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is obligatory in the colleges - even if the of the Saar ones are not of French.
Chávez regulates the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will differently make soon tick-tock than in the rest of the world.
December 9, president Hugo Chavez will make reassemble the half an hour old stop watch in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain meanwhile.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela communicated it, because of a new law, the watches will be regulated at less four hours and half universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone which does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position inter alia by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world separation time zones in full hours.
Moreover, Chávez announced Wednesday (standard time) the suspension of the relations with the close country, Colombia, because of a business of hostages.
The nationalist of left announced that as long as the Alvaro Uribe conservative would remain president de Colombie, it would maintain relations neither with the Head of State, nor with the Colombian government.
"I cannot it, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez which hastens a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by way of referendum Sunday.
With this reform, it would appreciably reinforce its capacity in the country.
The element release of this argument was the decision of Uribe to withdraw in Chávez the negociating brief in connection with the release of hostages with the rebels Marxists in Colombia.
Uribe "would have spit with the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new ringing of portable telephone makes fury in the country: "Por qué No you callas" (why you do not keep silent yourself) is the sentence that already more than one half-million of people downloaded on Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos which, at the most recent top ibéro-American, was irritated by the constant interpellations by populist by left and which said to him to be keep silent.
A fall of the wages threatens Germany in 2007.
In spite of the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a true depreciation of the wages threatens the German employees this year.
Experts quoted all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimist forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-böckler foundation, the employees should expect in 2007 a real reduction on their card of pay compared to the previous year.
"the fault returns to the weak development of the wages, with the increase in the Value-added tax and to the rises of the prices of the foodstuffs and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for the macro-economy and research on the economic situation, with the newspaper "Bild".
New loads could also intervene as regards unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the fall envisaged of the unemployment insurance of 3,3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However the national Agency for employment does not have any more the right to be in the embarrassment to require of the Federation of the appropriations or the financial assistances, according to words' of the politician of SPD.
Tuesday was known that the explosion of the prices of the foodstuffs and hydrocarbons had pushed the rate of inflation on its higher level for 13 years.
On the whole, the prices increased by 3,0 percent from one year to another.
Venus is the infernal binocular of the Earth.
In spite of its hostile atmosphere with the life, Venus resembles the Earth more than than one believed until now: the European space probe "Come Express train" discovered flashes in the atmosphere and of the whirlwinds to the poles, similar with those which appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, the scientists have supposed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Come Express train" brought the proof today from there - it detected electromagnetic waves in extreme cases of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus burst with a height of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud in cloud, brings back Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Natural".
According to the theory celebrates cyprine, the flashes would have revealed the life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans which led to the formation of amino acids, hones angle of the life.
It is not the case on Venus: "If life there were, that must have been on a very old date of the History", explains Sean Solomon of "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be today hardly alive things on the Venus surface: the atmosphere is approximately hundred times denser than on Earth, it reigns there sometimes of the temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal binocular of the Earth, but it remains a binocular", said Russel.
Why Venus, which resembles so much the Earth in mass and dimensions, was struck of such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the mission ESA.
The departure of "Come Express train" in November 2005 was an important stage in Venusian research, since more no probe was on the way for the exploration of this planet since the Eighties ten.
In the opinion of researcher, the most recent results of research which was now presented in several articles of "Nature" do not underline only the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our planéte close more than are supposed with the first access.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the known whirlwinds déja to the North Pole, a swirl of clouds to the South Pole, which turns still much more quickly.
The phenomenon points out the draughts in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale E Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planéte of sytème solar A almost the same mass that the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilométres, almost also large.
The qualified planéte evening star or morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
It turns however much more slowly on itself: one day Venusian lasts 243 days land.
Although Venus, with temperatures on the surface of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, the scientists suppose that both planétes were constituted under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And whereas the carbon dioxide was fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus the greatest part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with Dalaï LAMA.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the quarrel of the parties in connection with the reception of Dalaï LAMA to the Chancellery.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks against the chancelière after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler worries about the appearance of Germany and sum the great coalition to close the quarrel in connection with the reception of Dalaï LAMA.
"We should not present at the external world a nation divided on this question", said Köhler to Handelsblatt.
In parallel, Köhler showed comprehension for the reception of Dalaï LAMA by the chancelière Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"the humans right have a universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures" said Köhler.
Each one knows that Germany should preserve a sensitive balance as regards foreign politics, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches according to which it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancelière did not take her distances with the traditionelle policy of Only one China.
"China also knows it", said Köhler.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly made known his dissatisfaction in connection with the reception with Dalaï LAMA and had been attacked for that apart from the rows of CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "policy of front" of CDU as regards foreign politics.
After the reception of Dalaï LAMA to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports/ratios.
Thus the Chinese government did not only countermand the Minister for Finance German Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but information's of Spiegel, also cold the dialogue called of strategy of the Foreign Ministers of the two countries has.
The chief of the government of China Wen Jiabao requires from now on of the chancelière allemmande Angela Merkel of reconnaitre that the reception of the Dalai Lama was an error.
China refuses that the European politicians receive the spiritual chief of Tibet in his official functions, supported Wen Jiabao thus the Chinese position.
The words and acts of Dalaï LAMA would show that it tries to separate from China Tibet and others regiones Tibetans, which includes also other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against the riots like those of France.
Street battles with the police force, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots like those of France.
All must be put in?uvre so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany does not burst in the streets by violence, required the German Minister of Interior Department.
Barricades which burn, of the breakers who draw on the police force with shotguns: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Minister of Interior Department Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must take care that a social explosive contitue not also on our premises and is defused in violence.
We must take this with serious ", said it to" Neue Presse "appeared in Hanover.
All the young individuals would not sometimes happen to leave themselves there with the rapids transformations social reality.
The Federation, the States federate and the communes already worked with firmness to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
That would not touch only the integration of the immigrants.
"Of the tops of integration to the conferences on Islam, that shows already its first successes."
But it would be however too early for an end of alarm.
Schäuble points out in same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of town planning as in France.
In the Paris and its suburbses of north, young people had devoted themselves to serious street battles with the police force during last nights.
In Toulouse also, public cars and buildings burned.
Moreover main efforts of integration on behalf of the German government, here are what required the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Taking into account the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would remain nevertheless a need for acting.
Kolat stresses the fact that the quota the unemployed ones in the young people below 25 years resulting from immigration would be higher than the average.
It would be necessary for all to ensure more places the formation.
Kolat insisted: "We must give to the young people a prospect".
The President of the Turkish communities added however that a social control in the families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people resulting from immigration do not want moreover to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat exhorted: "But we must nevertheless be careful."
It would quickly be necessary "to give to the young people the possibility of taking part in work and the formation".
While waiting, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-the-Beautiful, all remained very calm during the night.
Units of police force were in place, a helicopter flew over the zone with projectors.
The authorities in station made share of three arrests as well as few burned cars and dustbins.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 forces of safety ensures calms it.
The police force will intervene as a long time as necessary, annoncait the Minister of Interior Department Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of the suburb.
In the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 police officers were wounded at the time of the riots to Villiers-the-Beautiful.
In the following night, the disorders overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots burst after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost the life Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet floor, the police force responsible for did not die for the young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The entry in utopian scene of the chancelière shows that the coalition in finished with the bottom - and that there is nothing any more to wait of her.
In which country does live this chancelière with the Juste?
For its intervention afflicting in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of contents, it is necessary to say: not here - not in the country which would have, with final, being governed by it.
The reproach to concentrate too much on the policy was pushed back by Angela Merkel of a hard and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, has it says and showed only by there that she does not want to include/understand what the critics want.
At the Parliament, it made visible of all with which point this reproach was exact.
There was neither of concrete interest nor hardly of feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
At the place, Angela was presented in the form of a cloud: politicking in weightlessness, which flees in the foreign politics and which even there remains in the approximation.
For example the protection of the climate: in this matter, it is still pleased still and on the agreements with Heiligendam, but does not say how the objectives on the climate will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of oneself - to have also little modesty, the chief of CDU would have still refused it two years ago.
Now it studs with ready-made phrases, that the growth would touch people.
By there it destroys its image of pragmatist, who résoud problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, the problems of domestic policy are a marginal phénomème.
Poverty at the children and the concerns of the workers with low wages?
There remain to him some additional sentences for that.
In this matter the number of times is revealing where it makes lapses when it acts of family benefit.
Here, Merkel needs three startings to pronounce a sentence with precise half.
It staggers in unknown ground, as from the moment when that becomes concrete.
The branch Attacks
In the debate of Youtube of the republican candidates to presidential, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are devoted to a hard offensive battle - and must now fear a candidate outsider.
The tension of the candidates bursts already on the first subject.
It would have made of New York a "refuge for the clandestine ones", reproach Mitt Romney with its adversary Rudy Giuliani.
This one against its side by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a harbour for clandestine" answers Giuliani and reproach the former governor of Massachussetts to have employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the republican base does not have moreover official favourites, the eight candidates with presidential are useful themselves of the debates on CNN before very discrediting their adversaries.
The films amateurs 30 second old that the users of Internet sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to the capacity", launches John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is in the round to only claim an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney also is made vigorously make the lesson by the veterans of Vietnam, when it refuses to condemn as a torture what is called the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the drowning is simulated.
However the fact that the important topics of the countryside go meanwhile beyond the war to Iraq and of the debates on torture sees in the reactions of the common room of St Petersburg in Florida.
Whether the preserving values are rented or that the future rises of taxes are refused, the applause breaks in the auditorium.
It is there that where resident the weaknesses of the two favourites appear once again.
"I made an error at that time", explain Romney contrit and present his excuses at the base and the public televised in 1994 to have still been a partisan of the abortion.
Giuliani on the contrary passes in a n?ud running when one asks him for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time into civil.
One day after his withdrawal as a chief of the armies, the man of Pakistani capacity Musharraf was invested as a president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army finish.
The president of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested Thursday for new a five years mandate.
Pakistani television retransmitted on line the ceremony with the presidential palate of the Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the wellbeing of the Nation.
Wednesday it had transmitted its load of chief of the armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and was thus etait folded with the international pressure, in particular that of the United States.
Eight years after his catch of being able by a putsch without bloodshed, the former General reigns from now on for the first time as a Head of civil State.
By this withdrawal of the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had filled the principal requirement of the opposition and the Occident.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state that Musharraf had issued on November 3.
Already little after its Musharraf nomination will suspend the emergency state, according to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will fill another requirement of the Occident.
The supreme Court of the country, that Musharraf had occupied after the introduction of the emergency state with lawyers of its rows, had rejected last week all the recourse against the discussed re-election of the Head of State on October 6.
Meanwhile five soldiers were killed in the tribal area of north in Waziristan of North in an attack against a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to indications' of the spokesman of the army, a bomb exploded in a street close to the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock make their return.
The supergroupes of Germany of the Seventies rejouent: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return recordings of their great success "Live 1974 are appeared".
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The feeling envisaged occurs then in the shape of three Messrs announced with the poster of the evening.
Each one has its small limps in front of him, its cable and before all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years, throne in the medium in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked on the left of Michael Rother, young person 57 year old and possession of a portable computer and a guitar.
, observed on the right by all the auditorium, Hans-joachim Roedelius, 73 years, curves itself on its console.
Each one contributes to the noise, inter alia very Beat.
And sometimes that is added by inadvertency with a traditional piece of music.
That does not seem besides too to disturb the Messrs themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonized cheek again ensured some agitations among the amateurs of Krautrock.
There is the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, certainly, the name reasons in the collective memory the pop one, but to in no case in a so durable way so that this group has missed also painfully for 32 years.
But why German have wouldn't also the right to celebrate its alive legends of the Seventies?
More especially as what is called trompeusement "Krautrock" rained always more in England and America that in the country of origin.
Lorque the industry of the music decreed in 2003 the Echo price with the survivors of the group of Cologne Can for their?uvre, one saw in the room the interrogative German pop faces.
When Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the groups Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyrical praise, the astonishment did not have any more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of Red Hot Chile Peppers like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown are only the and single one.
The memory of this fact déja is taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that for this period, the capacity of impact which felt was much weaker than what was allotted to him thereafter by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
One played initially in the cellars below the Berliner scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly repaired in Kraftwerk and had been finally made a name as guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the German group most radical.
About 1973, Rother followed however the musicians of Cluster in exile in the fôrets of Weserbergland.
There, in an old farm of Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived like members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be made torment as a children's nurse.
Rather an artistic existence with the manner of Spitzweg.
Supposedly was in the dustbin a flag of the choral society Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Much retained Harmonia far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "Of Luxury".
Because also serene and moderate that the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of the deadwood was not only used for him with research of oneself.
CD "Live 1974" which has just appeared was recorded at the time of a concert with Griessem in front of a public record of almost 50 heads, as somebody believes to remember.
Rother emitted at that time the wish to force Harmonized to be involved from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of the esotericism and ensured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (c?urs in flames).
Cluster was reanimated in the Eighties and has since more success than Harmonia in ever had.
One owes the album Live de Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label set the goal to maintain Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to the contemporary music.
Neu! déja unearthed on this occasion like the personal?uvre of Roedelius had.
The physical resurrection of Harmonized takes place at the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and author of the book of pocket "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole of the limit of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be encircled with regard to the future pop music.
The left place vacuum by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno planes in the room in the medium of the singular sounds: "the only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photographs which show the producers with Harmonia in the part of the farm.
Projections of other photographs in black and white of tools cabled in bazaar are used for the formation of the legend.
In front of, the three veterans are again occupied improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to draw with the instruments from the sounds thanks to the instruments for built purposes oneself.
Today, the electronic music resembles the electronic music.
Three into large finicking of technique.
With that even the choral society of the house will change nothing there.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and one sings at a pretty time "Aaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It is never acts of rock'n'roll.
The roots were sought in the blues than in the academies of music (Edge), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
That which shouts "68" is not completely wrong, and also Harmonized is not let now more irritate by that from now on.
But what goes more self will be covered thoroughly on the scene.
Where does the music start and where it finishes?
That can type on the nerves of somebody (?) or grant fugacious moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is quite simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "fatal Peace", two films approach the war of Balkans again.
But both do not convince.
Either the projects rest of too on the action and on the exchanges of foolish shootings or on the contrary they are too larmoyants.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
The good news initially: admittedly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic always hide in the mountains of Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the most lugubrious back-country of the war of Bosnia, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had lastly lost sight of the fact the most beautiful man of the Eighties, because far too many gentillets roles and futils in films with feelings for women and far too many conferences press on the topic of Buddhism charmed the desire to him for being shown.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party nevertheless" - when the hunter becomes driven out (why the films of today do have to be as long and confused as collective agreements of drivers of engines?)
It delivers a splendid representation full with covering joints of?il: at the bottom, its character to defer war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and the industry of films were not also benevolent: a man who for a long time has his best moments behind him, but which, even as a monument in ruin with its decline, however kept visible remainders of its old charm.
But in spite of this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "fatal Peace", which leaves also this week, the interminable film continuation missed on the war by Balkans.
"fatal Peace" one can make the lawsuit quickly: the talking film about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max Riemelt), who save Serb Kosovan franks-tireurs, in which one of both tomb still promptly in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serb ones for once are not presented like the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost well too quickly in the action and the exchanges of foolish shootings.
That remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but with a war in the place.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there never was a truth good film on the war of Balkans.
Perhaps the history of the three reporters of war American, who conditions itself to track the high war criminal "the fox", could have become, with another realizer and another scenario writer (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another moment new "a Now Apocalypse".
Because the stories resemble each other in a striking way: two males go as a small team in the forest, to achieve something that the soldiers cannot make and for the two males, that becomes a voyage in the madness.
One of the reasons of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one does not let simply Simon Hunt be the cynical one deserted equipped with a c?ur, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
Not, script must in addition allot to him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian assassinated thereafter.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when to defer it, in the five last minutes space, by an accelerated process, arrives so that NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of premiums of the world did not succeed in five years: to catch the war criminal and to leave it for a right revenge with the Moslem Bosnians.
They is so bad which one should seize the international Court of the Hague of crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has a too major human concern.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and it suspects American and French (here they must agree exceptionally) not to lead hunting in a rather intensive way because of secret political agreements.
But the disposed good and the malicious one are this so similar time that famous a poême of Brecht comes us to the idea.
That speaks about a mask out of wooden of an Asian demon on the work table of the poête: "Sympathizing, I see the veins of the face inflated, clearly: as it is tiring to be malicious."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have such tumescent heads exactly, but which insinuate into which point it is tiring to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war of Balkans.
Recently, it was brought back in this newspaper that all the Hollywood films on Iraq were large failures.
One can add: there never yet was of good films on South Africa.
What is worth each time: when a star trails on a hearth of crisis or a minefield, it leaves there then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits Grenzen outward journey" with Angelina Jolie or "" Blutdiamanten "with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
At all events, the decades always passed before Hollywood can make a good film on the holocaust with "the list of Schindler".
Certain films must still mature well - those which are worth today traditional?uvres on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Now Apocalypse" or "Full Metal Jackett" do not have to in no case celebrated unanimously at their time like chiefs of?uvre.
But perhaps let us know some today also simply too about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives on line on two screens at the same time at the house,
And that charmed with the scenario writers the lack of scruples which they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "the dictator" in fact became also good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know yet at which point the mode Nazi really dominated.
Perhaps that one should not want to be good when one wants to make goods flims.
Perhaps is necessary it to have the sarcastic and outdistanced artistic glance of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When one questioned it on the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war of Balkans, it answered: "That is due only to the fact that certain things never change".
"the large cities will be always awfully dangerous, the men will be always assassinated in a horrifying way and the war will always règnera in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The catch of retreat of the mayor of with the candidature of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of summer ran up in the policy and the economy against the virulent critical ones.
Many wants to continue to fight for the Plays at the edge of water.
But Von Beust calls with realism in the appreciation of the chances.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as being "bad for the local economy".
Lately, no other project had deployed as many forces of motivation in the city than the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the dash politico-sportsman could not have been maintained in same measurements".
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point to him, "which takes as starting point another modified diary".
The mayor Ole von Beust remained about it Wednesday with his preceding declarations, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg which decides on a candidature for the Olympiads, but the German Federation of the Olympic sports" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It renvoit with the discounted decision of the Federation of the sports at the beginning of December, in connection with the candidature of Munich for the plays of winter of 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the lapse of time that we had envisaged up to 2028 until there, we will not have any chance."
However the dream does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The sporting Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted the declarations of Beust.
Of that the impression would be given that Hamburg does not want to present any more its candidature for the Olympic Games in the 25 next years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, by burying the projects already now", told to Wednesday the President of the HSB Günter Ploss.
An abandonment of the candidature would be moreover in contradiction with the declarations of the chief of the Senate at the time of the reception in assembly pleinière of the German Federation of the higher schools of the sport.
Over there, Von Beust would have qualified the candidature of Hamburg for Universiades of 2015 like not being "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of the higher schools of the sport had initially in the last weeks nominated Hamburg like candidate city.
Fraction SPD of the mayor reproached the Senate used this invaluable time in the construction of residences in Hamburg.
"the development of Small Grasbrook was refused by the Senate during years because it played the chart of the Olympiads and excluded construction from residences", the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
Whereas the SPD always claimed for Small Grasbrook a plan integrated in the Olympiads and a posterior use of the residences, CDU would have misé exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidature for the Olympic Games of summer in 2012 for its part would have raised in Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg however had broken against Leipzig.
They are not the cases of Warhols.
That which connects the Sweden concepts and case out of wooden, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or if?
In this moment, cases out of wooden made in Sweden throw shades on the list of the?uvres of Warhol.
A great part of the eighty ten Brillo-Boxs of "Stockholm Type" listed over there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned there is a few months the authenticity of Brillo-Boxs of year 1968 of Andy Warhol, internal research of Moderna Museet of Stockholm leads today to a desenchantor result: six "Brillo-Boxings", whose former director of the museum Pontus Hulten made gift in 1995 in Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a great part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm Type", which circulate on the international market of art.
The old history is tangled up, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxings", of the cases out of wooden painted, which are based on the design red-blue-white of the soap powder paperboards "Brillo".
An exposure of its work to Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo made cases of paperboard: Those did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been directly delivered factory of Brillo boarding.
It did not act here of?uvres of art, but rather of their models, samples of exposure.
In same time, Warhol had given the authorization into 1968 well to cause production of some cases drink Brillo in Sweden of it, which were not exposed besides to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today about approximately fifteen cases out of wooden which at the time would have entered of right the history of art and the biddings, as original Brillo-Boxings of authorized Andy Wahrol, with the appelation "Standard Stockholm".
Some of them reached in the auction sales more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem from now on is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén claimed, wrongly, later than approximately hundred cases out of wooden had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, than Warhol would have then yielded to him.
In truth, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exposure to St-Pétersbourg.
On this date, Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, conservative as a chief of Moderna Museet, examined, beside six Brillo-Boxings of the museum, three others of private collections suedoises, among which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated plates were initially printed and sandpapered, then one applied with a brush of the oil-base paint white.
The texture of the copies which date from the year 1990 reveals on the contrary that painting was directly applied without priming coat to the laminated plates, using a roller of painting - moreover it is not a question of one oil-base paint, but of an acrylic resin.
"These cases were not authorized by the artist and should be removed official list of Brillo-Boxings of Andy Warhol", implies the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If ' Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come from there another decision, Moderna Museet will classify the six cases in its collection as a copies/matériel of exposure."
Already in July Authentication Board of course announced, that it would inquire into the "heavy charges" which will be raised in the business of the soap powder cases.
But since one haloes inéxorable silence over there.
The rebellious Soldiers of Manila give up
In the Philippines, the rebellious soldiers give up, the same ones who had cut off themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had required the withdrawal of the president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproached to the President the corruption and the electoral fraud, said to reporters in the hotel which under no circumstances would it answer of any bloodshed.
The soldiers faithful to the capacity not very front had taken by storm the hotel using gas lacrimogene.
The two dozen soldiers had been cut off since from the hours in the building.
Approximately half of them were held Wednesday in front of the courts because of an attempt of putsch missed in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
It benefitted from the audience to eclipse suddenly with approximately 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were normally to supervise them, had apparently deserted in its favour and had joined to its mutiny.
They were introduirent in the Peninsula hotel and required the withdrawal of the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The honest troops with the capacity buckled the sector around the sizeable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Cabinet of safety.
The national Adviser for safety Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"people have enough of it", said Trillanes.
"We invite the people to join us".
The General Danilo Lim, who ordered before the unit of elites of Scouts Rangers, declared that other units of the army wanted to join soon to walk.
The critics of the mode had called with a great demonstration against the President Wednesday.
Its government is surrounded since of the months by the reproaches of corruption.
The district of finances of Manila was already since 2003 the theatre of the attempt at mutiny of approximately 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke nearly 12 midnight after to the refusal of the army to join to it.
Since 1986 there already were at least seven attempts at putsch counters governments elected democratically in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured a participation of more than 20 percent of the company of Versatel telecommunication.
The average price by action is 14,46 euros, as the company Wednesday communicated it.
Only 20,05 percent of the authorized capital would be held.
There was déja speculated before in a repurchase.
The option would remain open to increase the participation in Versatel further.
With this step one seeks to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of the DSL, communicated United Internet.
Right front, of the assumptions had already been made Wednesday in connection with an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the operator of network of Düsseldorf of 5 percent to 15,1 percent.
The institute of credit would hold the money only for one third part, tells one on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a participation of almost 10 percent in the mobile telephone company Drillisch.
Within the framework of a new issue of capital, Drillisch placed out of Stock Exchange 17,4 million news actions of a value of 106,4 million euros.
United Internet in bought 5,15 million for 31,1 million euros.
Moreover, the companies opened negotiations about co-operations as regards marketing of the products of DSL and mobile telephony.
"We renforcons our partnership", explained a spokesman of United Internet.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb competitor freenet.
For the moment, the two companies want to be estimated satisfied with their participation of ten percent at freenet, and not to make use of their right to endorse 18,49 additional percent at freenet, entrusted United Internet Thursday.
The two companies would leave all the opened options however, particularly to increase the participation in SA freenet, one learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and freenet in connection with a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker still not easily foreseeable on freenet which lasts since months formed part of the consolidation of the German market of the télécoms.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2,9 million customers bound by a mobile contract of telephony and 1,27 million customers DSL and subscriptions complete.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch held until now a direct participation in freenet of 6,01 percent.
It was from now on agreed that Drillisch would bring approximately four additional percent.
The right to buy the 18,49 percent of company Vatas the investment had déja decided in August.
