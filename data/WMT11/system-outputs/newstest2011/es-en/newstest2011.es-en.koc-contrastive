What do you mind? The ČSSD in Prague does not know and to voldemort or cake
The new councillors of ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome language barriers, it is clear that the components of the board of Prague and the local council to understand their renewed colleagues from the ODS.
The period aktuálně.cz "examined" to the members of the new Council of ČSSD to test their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when they ruled Prague current members of the coalition.
The dictionary encoded using the cream policy of Prague during the previous period, the mayor Pavel bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes more acquaintances of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been established that the new councillors almost not understand these known concepts.
At least, so they say.
"who is voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know."
"rather, I am a rookie in the praguense policy," he said during the examination of terminology of 'colegueo "councillor for culture Lukáš kaucký.
And as regards the political veteran, reacted as Karel Březina.
Perhaps aware of the concept "hole of golf."
"This is potentially the only expression of all that I preguntasteis that use from time to time."
"If it does not normally use slang."
The glossary, whose definitions published the paper aktuálně.cz last June before the Congress to vote on the ODS, chose six examples, in particular those which are particularly connected with the municipal authorities in Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts' voldemort, '"greatest hole of golf of Prague," "go to the cake," "back of bull," "betrayal of the capital" and "shield."
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, antonín weinert, which in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but never again take the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr dolínek, refused to do so.
"I think in these things and assess how to enjoy themselves the civic democrats."
"What is important to me is how we will understand one another in the execution of our programs," said.
As has been seen, supposedly the councillor Lukáš kaucký had not realised that the title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the former Mayor bém, Roman janoušek.
To kaucký the word 'voldemort "did not mean anything; the only word that he is in" the hole of golf largest of Prague ."
"It is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký immediately, it adds: "but rather what I know about the news."
"I will take that point to a course of languages', joking.
Karel Březina is not the only one which recognises in the hole of golf the tunnel blanka, but also the councillor for the environment Lukáš plachý.
Later, both sociodemócratas know who is really voldemort and Lukáš plachý even knows where to find that character; moreover, suspicion the meaning of "go to the cake."
"I think that means going to a company of Prague"; soon it uncovered plachý to the headquarters of the business of janoušek.
Like Březina, suggests that such knowledge was the news, but that employs just vocabulary.
According to participants in the test, between the sociodemócratas there is no glossary so familiar in colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but they seem not to have anything like that."
"rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or do word games with the names," says the President of the ČSSD praguense, Petr hulínský, whose party colleagues call hulda.
"at school I received bříza, but I do not know if my colleagues I also call as well," admits his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper aktuálně.cz tested the name and works.
For his party colleagues, weinert is děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav poche, which teamed up before the election trickery during the sponsorship of party, is nicknamed "igráček" ("Playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only titles that the sociodemócratas tolerated in the talks in the party.
To hulínský does not like being described as hulda, but the newspaper aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this President praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of the clubs' it recalls that Petr hulínský received his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of the "witches," according to published in a pamphlet
Women seen as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to have a great age, they cannot work, for example, for reasons of health, are unmarried and not have children.
Women who are "relapse" witches are sent to an isolated area, not to harm the rest of the people.
"men rarely suffer such but."
"It puts healthy young women, for help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso is occupies a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure."
Issued an information leaflet which should help to avoid the witch-hunt.
However, this has a drawback.
"more than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso neglects to read," warns the daily, die standard on the disadvantages of awareness in writing.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In wins, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the week died ammy hemmah, 72 years, when three women and two men tortured, covered in petrol and burned.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors say that was due to an unfortunate series of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was set in the oil that is used to the unciones rituals.
They set ablaze when the group wanted to "eject bad spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" supporters people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a businessman of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "the devoradores of human souls always represented a danger," she said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to appease the witch-hunt, in Gambia last year still participated in it the President.
"The President gambiano jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched a broad wave of McCarthyism, allegedly had been linked to his death and had tried to kill the President himself through the magic Negro."
"to help him brought to shamans from nearby Guinea, protected by police officers, soldiers and the staff of the President, were to force men and women chosen at random chosen between the peoples gambianos to ownership of the President in kanilai," points out in his report the organization Amnesty International.
In the building, those arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with effects hallucinogens, moreover, are causing intestinal problems and kidney.
Two of those arrested and did not survive the stay on the farm.
Following international pressure, finally released around 1,000 people arrested.
The occupant of bakala: hot stoves with coal and signing a higher rent
The man, aged, and robust, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the customers of the company byty rpg "tycoon coal" zdeňek bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm was about documents with the new contracts of hiring Three floors: yours, his daughter and his son, who is serving sentence.
The three I just looting the liberalisation of the rent.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the son will pay starting next year 4.100 crowns for a floor of two rooms with kitchen from second category.
"In addition, it has no hot water and heating is based on a boiler of solid fuel," shows the finger at the man in the new contract of their son, on whose signature has full powers.
"But what I signed," explains means angry, medium resigned.
The civil partnership bytyokd.cz, who described the new conditions of rent as "incorrect and dishonest," recommends to the tenants who do not sign new contracts and to wait until December 7, the date that will publish a guide on how to proceed in such cases.
But, in view of this, the man only just shrug.
"everyone says one thing," says with bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory testing of liberalisation.
After New Year would happen with the vast majority of the ones who, in the Czech Republic, were so far under rent regulated.
That is why, aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The waiting room from rpg is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday to the nine, was already full.
Just beside the door are the security guards and his side a machine for picking numbers.
"rent 2011," it can be read in a button Luminoso of his touch screen.
The pulsarlo, leaves the machine a papelito with a number.
Almost no time or to read "157" and the number appears on the big screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Soon after, a marriage of old age to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rent.
The majority of people come to solve problems, as usual, applications arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the mail from the tenants of the majority of the 44 apartments belonging to rpg around mid-November.
Rpg byty proposes in letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November, opens a window in the centre of attention to customer for the new rent.
"has been in use for a week, so is beginning," respond after hesitating briefly, workers who are in it when the client is presented as a journalist.
The liberalisation and the old flats for miners of bakala are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the election, as was the loud and clear the Vice-President of Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomír zaorálek, the ČSSD, and now appear in the newspapers of the area.
"twenty years later I would like a new soil."
"neither I changed the damned plate bathroom," desahoga man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, by the time they come mostly retired to see if they get a reduction in rent if you sign in time, as promised by the supply of rpg.
I shall also half of the discount on the rent February the remaining tenants to sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the 'liberalisation' mining certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, just asked for rent in 2011 around 40 or 50 people," estimated the effect of the window.
Meanwhile, rpg proposes online and on their pieces make individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two sides cannot reach an agreement on the lease, it must resolve the issue of an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed as possible and in full accordance with the law," warns rpg in its pages.
"here is not going to judge anyone," is one of the pioneering rpg byty and a man in the street opposite the centre of attention to customer gives, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I left 5,000 for food; I have no means to go to court," she says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We will see."
"Mr zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so perhaps the people expect," she said.
The regulation of rent will no longer exist in the majority of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according byty rpg, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still do not cover even the amounts needed to fund the maintenance of the Community," recalls Pavel klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company byty rpg, who adds that the neglected state from the bottom of the Community that enfada to the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 rpg was able to rent apartments to invest in four billion, in the four years that Iran from 2011 to 2014, the number will rise to 5 200 million.
The great screen hanging from the ceiling, as opposed to the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data highlighted in red.
"The increase in the rent in 2011 in a 15% and less applies to 31.200 apartments, in other words, more than 90% of the properties of rpg."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum 7,50 Czech crowns per month per square metre," indicated on the screen.
Only a 38% increase in rent for 400 flats of the portfolio of rpg.
"in such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19,66 Crowns per square metre," suggests rpg.
In 2600 apartment, the lease will stay the same next year.
Rpg byty promises that liberalisation will not affect coup to rents, but escalará between four to eight years.
In addition, the following compromise: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (consult the graph) again in the flats, mainly in saving on heating: new windows and heating.
Have priority people to sign the agreement of rising rent.
The architects have understood that the offices also need childcare
The administrative building avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company arch.design.
No one would say that is within a small nursery with everything they own to such facilities: walls of colours, furniture creative and even a miniature park in the terrace listening outside.
Since October last year, can go to the children of employees of arch.design.
The company arch.design architectural projects, whose study took numerous buildings known of Brno, thought since the first designs of the building avriopoint in include a space for his miniguardería.
The company employs about 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and allow the arquitectas and delineantes could return soon to work after maternity leave.
Along with the possibility of having a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits offered by arch.design their workers in the framework of its social agenda.
The builders, and arquitectas thus have the possibility of combining a profession demanding of the care of the children.
The miniguardería was an idea of the employees of arch.designu and, with the support of the leadership, succeeded in obtaining funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The miniguardería enterprise is funded through the European Social Fund in the context of the operational programme for human resources and employment, as well as the budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (an endowment of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, to recruit qualified staff and services.
When it comes to funding (two years), the company arch.design has the obligation to keep the miniguardería with their own funds over three years.
The preparation of the draft lasted a year and in the presentation of the request for funding helped the company economy rating.
The attention of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; moreover, they are present throughout the day for caring nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The nursery currently plays host to children with no age limit, although the majority of them have less than three years.
Given that this is a "miniguardería," so can only respond simultaneously to a maximum of five children, but with the shift towards more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, independently of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is a lesson and individual care, the content of the programme of the miniguardería are comparable to the programme of the kindergarten.
In her children not only play, but they also receive a quality education: from the basic education to prepare for school, to teach English.
Not only has the kinds of toys and games of table, but also of a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself to create an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of collect late to children when the school is far from their place of work.
So, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this would naturally a relationship of trust between the worker and the employer.
In this way, arch.design being signed companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support to the family and, in short, this programme reinforced the marketing of staff.
The home of the bone remains fascinando after 100 years of Gaudí internal observed.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lagarto, ladders are reminiscent of the pillar of a dinosaur and the balcony seem to the mouth of a fish open.
So is the Casa batlló, in Barcelona, the architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its shape similar to a skeleton, the local apodaron "the home of the bones."
Their organic forms, their glossy colors, the novel use of the stone, the bits of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and the ubiquitous lines mildly curvadas, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front page of the home is playing oneiroid lines, colors and sensitive texturas taken from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, there is a certain geometry, pace and a carefully thought.
By the evening, the entire front of the House looks even more impressive, since that is illuminated so that it improves the brightness of the colors.
Serpentea and the torsión of the ways we still surprised in its internal affairs.
The wood ondulada copy of windows, the barandillas, the decorations of the doors, the mirillas and signs.
The Casa batlló, which is in the district of eixample in the number 43 of the lively streets, commercial passeig de grácia, emerged from the renovation of a House of the year 1877 the architect Emilio Chamber courteous.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the home was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep batlló, initially insisted in overturning the previous building and start from scratch, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudí reconstruction of a novel and cheaper.
However, the Casa batlló, composed of various apartments not devised Antoni Gaudí.
It has assisted in the design of the architect Josep Maria jujol.
Indeed, in their plans for the project emerged ornaments for the apartment is representative of the owner of the property and mosaics used in the facade.
In the front also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa batlló was the start of the successful collaboration of jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the home milá and park güell of Gaudí, they were in other parts of the same.
Due to their organic form, the premises shortly after their completion the apodaron "the home of the bones."
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows started to call it 'the home of the yawns. "
It also says that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, pattern of Catalonia.
Other elements of the building escultóricos religious motives.
Gaudí projected at home, a single system for the age of central heating, ventilation and air vents and chimneys characteristic.
It may be strange his inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí did not comply with standards of the time and refused to be influenced by them.
Even so, the building got the relevant permission from the outset, though obviously the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years after its completion, the city was so shocked by the result which was asked to amend it.
He resented, for example, that the construction included columns even until the public footpaths.
The arrangements were never carried out, quite the contrary: only 15 days after the request of the city, Josep batlló requested (and won) permission to lease the two top floors of the building.
In the lower floors spread the owner.
In the gallery on the second floor in the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was hired at a jewellery.
The House, six flats, is completely atravesada by a ladder that leads to the terrace listening to the roof.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all the angles and lines honest, cubriéndolos curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection in space.
The common part can connect completely opening the doors of the reception and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without renouncing the privacy needed for more intimate.
The House, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only won a new facade, but it is also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also amazing how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the internal courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with the two colours provides maximum of light on all floors of the House.
Was based simply on the principle that the target reflects more light than the dark colours, which instead absorb the rays of sun.
Anyone can visit the Casa batlló, who in 2005 was added to the list of World Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
On the first floor of the House is the apartment espacioso more and more of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visitors confirmed, or found, that it is a very good business and widened the visits to the euro zone and to the attic, including the terrace listening to the roof.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaches the 16,50 euros, although students, pensioners and the holders of the tourist card gets a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí building in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with their towers of lagarto, should be friend quickly from one resident of the neighbouring houses and visit him at home.
How it chooses the mattress and the somier: women and men looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous to bed; what really gives its quality a good bed is the surface to lying down, namely the mattress and the somier.
Above all they must be supplemented to perfection to adapt to specific users.
During the election, there are numerous factors, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
It is also important to the kind of Interior for the mattress and the somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a chalet in weekend not ordinarily heating, should not be used because látex cushions are "warm" more slowly.
In addition, usually weighing considerably more than the usual polyurethane cushions.
Therefore, it is necessary to get around more often.
If not properly aired channels of the centre and, above, are on a firm foundation, keep within the moisture. Even moho can appear below.
When choosing a bed, also influence the customs.
Anyone who has spent much time abroad, often uses a mattress very high with a soft layer and will have to be in a lower surface.
"almost all the hockey players who became the NHL complained that there were sleeping just as well."
"for their ground down shoulders, heels and caderas needed cushions with a soft layer of viscoelástica."
"This kind of cushions also are recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so that they are wrong information of expression and of the skin," explains hadamcziková Sylva, which specializes in the acolchado furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, time-consuming preferring the viscoelástica cushions.
"Today there is no longer a problem, because they have these suitable tempur and Italians magniflex, but also the Czech brand tropico."
There is no longer to be a player in the NHL to see the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" is very simple.
Optimises its rigidity and form of the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing presses; during the night, will not cycling as after a hard game.
Simply, they slept better.
The viscoelástica doubles as protection against the wounds.
By choosing the size of the buffer, add up the length of their feet, namely between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example of singles recommends at least between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a standard simple to calculate the wide: the lying down their should have their hands encogidas comfortably to the elbow," advises the ingeniera Helena prokopová, informed of cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, which already has many years to manage the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the furniture, who teaches in specialist schools.
In twin rooms, each one needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase attention should be paid to combine the height of the cushions.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to put on the somieres to different heights, which is not always possible in all the beds.
The foam cushions should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with interior of docks a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three inch are for the layer that adapts to the forms and relaxing.
"in touch with the hand or in the mattress, certainly should not be noticed the docks," warns Helena prokopová.
Each mattress requires a kind of somier determined.
The bedrooms acolchados completely, in which the mattress and the basis are as siameses, does not make sense in the bedroom.
The cushions are breathing wrong and you cannot wash their forms, which today is often.
And, given that every night transpiramos between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the bed will begin to remind a great (and crowded) point of view.
For this reason, experts reject the slogans that talk of a life of buffer of up to 25 years or, even, of a guarantee for life.
However, there is a but.
So, sellers give a Council: in the cushions with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully ensure cleaning and brainwashing the forms, but better adds a protective buffer that they can be easily and launder.
Although currently being built fundas of cushions with closure one-for-one system on its shores, so the course are in two parts (something very important to money laundering and the size of the washing machine!), his intervention in the larger models (and for a single person) to lift the mattress can seem a fight between a fly weight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a somier, does a firm?
Never!
As for the beds designed to a night visitors.
However, it must make (if you do not already) ventilation holes in the table and must be used with a mattress with docks in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in pockets (like the German taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
The cushions them should not be used on such databases.
For the somieres of thin not articulables and containing between 14 and 18 thin, can be used látex cushions or sandwich cushions (for example, a combination of látex fibre and Coco), although it is always best to somier with a greater number of thin, 28 or more, in which the thin the lumbar area are strengthened and could regulate its rigidity.
The somieres of thin articulables should not be used with a cushion of docks, since we do not react to the reclinación.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the thin, it can also use the protection of the shoulders.
This is a special area of the thin that allows press or, even, tip the thin so that "around him" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have a very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
Even remember them manufacturers of cushions that, in the "male," began to use a softer precisely around the shoulders.
Also remember women, for which have a softer around the caderas.
For the most demanding customers, there are somieres structure in Cruz or tablets with the so-called dampening multitorsión.
The pressure was distributed among different points and reduce tension.
It must also note that, although using the mattress and somier adequate if you use a pillow (large and "mullida"), will the majority of the benefits.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must underlie the head and the corner can only reach the shoulders, so that we can relax the muscles of the same.
The right size recommended is 50 X 60 cm, something normal, for example in Scandinavia.
The lying down aside, the pillow must be at the same level, when combined with the somier with reinforcement to shoulders or the softer area of bed) that the height of the shoulders.
The modern cushions have something to do, it seems, with the original cushions stuff of straw.
The manufacturers are using increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, they are fashionable the biological cushions.
The raw materials from oil, which manufactures the polyurethane foam, be completed with natural oils, for example of ricino or soya.
Indeed, virtually all manufacturers employ known soya.
"organic, in the case of the cushions, mean that the center is made solely of natural materials," explains Petr vašíček enterprise tropico plus.
In addition, natural substances are used in the manufacture of the forms of the cushions, one of the first aloe Vera.
But it can also be opting for the microcápsulas, who released a fresh aroma of wood or lavanda.
There are also differences for men and women.
While the men were "refrescan" with plant extracts of breeze, to which the forms of mattress absorbing heat and refresque the body, women prefer "heat" the forms.
The extract of red toss enhances the circulation of blood, so that women feel more warmth.
Does favourites today?
The cushions made of foam, which are more porous, with a structure of cells tailored, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold and viscoelástica enable manufacture foam cushions of various areas which they know perfectly well where is head, shoulders and the heels.
A buffer of good quality will cost of seven thousand kroner up.
Those that have a therapeutic role often have a lower VAT, because they are considered as health resources.
The first thing we got this advantage in the Czech Republic was gumotex.
It is difficult to save in the cushions and somieres.
Sometimes it can approve the proposals put forward by manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer two cushions for the price of one.
For example, the designation magniflex offers duofreeze cushions with a memory foam memory affixed to the founded by 11.990 crowns.
The second is to be achieved for free.
The era of the viscoelástica with an open cell structure and a high density began with the "cósmico tempur material."
Initially emerged as material for NASA, because during landing astronauts eulogies were subjected to a huge burden.
Tempur is ablanda with the heat and tighten.
Consequently, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and best suited their pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid wounds, but also to improve comfort for the dream.
The foam viscoelástica not only used in the cushions, but also for medicinal products, for example to almohadas that is injected under the legs and the ease, as well as their movement.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use foam eucatherm C or twinsaver and the like.
More and more parents used monitoring devices in people to control their children.
The fear for the children has been more and more people to monitor them remains with by GPS.
The system, initially thought in the monitoring of vehicles, which can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl anička janatková.
By the time the device is the size of a box of cerillas, but soon it will reduce the size of a clock.
Many people gave fear the case of the defunct anička and began reporting on the means available to best protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading their privacy.
"we all try to tell us that this is not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," believes Petr pilin enterprise macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring devices in the Czech market.
"I recognise that, in certain cases, be of such devices, for example if they get into the bag of someone without their knowledge, but we have not yet come up with such cases."
"The majority of customers actually buy for safety reasons," adds pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the point of the "cajita" and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana bočková draws attention to the fact that, if the child does not want to take it, simply throw away.
"even the younger children show great creativity to intentionally lose certain things if they want to avoid being monitored."
"before, parents relied greatly on mobiles, but these could be turning off as easily as the monitoring device," says bočková.
In his view, it is debatable whether in case of attack this arrangement is genuinely useful.
"If this is a kidnapping, the author almost always will check if the child has, for some kind of electronic device that can unveil its location."
"Now is the telephone."
"We are going to extend the use of the devices, also the will, since its sale will surely be much publicity."
"in such cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
However, adds that such devices can help in the case of an attack from an improvised.
According to Robert čech enterprise RC monitoring, which provides services for monitoring both for vehicles and for people, even if, after an attack, destroying the monitoring device, its presence can be of help.
"can the device for which regularly sends the position after a certain period."
"If suffering damage, at least the latest position of the person in question."
"the most expensive devices have included an medidor slopes, so if the person is simply resbala and stays put, the device will issue an immediate warning with the position in question," says čech.
In his opinion, a service of this kind can be obtained with mobile phones with intelligent navigation, in which only has set up a special software.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that by the time these devices with a similar size to a box of cerillas or mobile phones to smaller.
Therefore, could be lost.
According to pilin of macro Weil, for that reason we are testing now with devices that resemble a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage of a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"or that identify it after some time, which may make the police earn time," it adds.
Although the monitoring devices are put in the doll or hanging will be using the same technology used for monitoring of vehicles.
It is checking the position with a GPS system (which is used in navigation in the car) combined with the function of a cell phone that the current position.
The army has enough mechas as to encircle all the Czech Republic but only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of fuse for setting explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added to his arsenal 224 miles of fuse.
Therefore, they have stocks to 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the fuse for explosives to stv group, A. S. by 40 billion crowns.
The staff of general responded to MFF dnes justify the purchase of such a large amount of fuse saying soldiers need for the training of 60 kilometres of fuse per year.
According to the calculations of the fireworks of the army, who was in contact MFF dnes, are however that, in this case, should undertake manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives each year all the generals, officers of high command, and even secretaries and limpiadoras.
They did not want to exempt nor defense minister Alexandr vondr and captain of the army Vlastimil picek.
Only thus could justify the army spent 60 kilometres of fuse.
Such length amounts to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, such as experts, to the training of every new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even by the use of the units of engineers or special) enough stocks for the 225 indicated previously.
The soldiers from the Brigade of swift complained myself a little before the Minister Vondra because they say that with little ammunition for various weapons, so that even the limited range of practices as a matter of money.
And not talked about the lack of underwear.
"I too fail to understand that we buy repeatedly such quantities of fuse."
"but it is his decision and, without doubt, you will know why they are so."
"for us, the army is a good customer who, as a company, we are trying to meet," admits the commercial director of stv group, Jan děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of fuse saying also that will take stock of this "bullets" at least for ten years.
However, Jan děcký, stv group, suggests that the fuse only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of the fireworks for the army or the police, for two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, can take up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by the criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
Following the completion of its useful life, each arm should be checked carefully to see whether it is still reliable and will not be detrimental to the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument is that the Treasury, to buy 445 kilometres of fuse, got a discount.
"We amounted to a 60% less than the requested last year of 244 miles," the spokesman pejšek of shopping centre and Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of fuse the fireworks of the police, to remove the ammunition from the second world war or the left by the Soviet army only because for years the 1,500 metres.
In addition, the police always asks only just the right amount as to exhaust the ammunition before it finishes its useful life.
It was decided for reasons of security for the fireworks and, moreover, can you get types of fuse more modern and reliable.
The Ministry has already obvious difficulties in closing tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of 200 000 people were preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the fireworks with those who spoke MFF dnes, after a couple of years there will be the next problem with the present: we must eliminate hundreds of kilometres of fuse old, which is now buying "cheap."
Until now I do live on the contacts that I won the tender
The fact of winning the competition "entrepreneur of the year" helped Lukáš pytloun in the sale of the franchises of their hotel.
The last edition, won the competition "entrepreneur of the year" the enterprising of 28 years Lukáš pytloun Liberec.
His history of success seems plucked out of a movie.
To Lukáš pytloun Le encantaba travel.
Abroad found in Liberec was required quality accommodation at a price.
With the savings that met with seasonal work abroad and a loan from the Bank bought a House that was half a derruida consisting of five apartments.
Bearing in mind that still studied his third year at university, it was really brave.
"Today, the value for money of housing in our area I drove to do something about it," says Lukáš pytloun.
He began renting out the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the revenue it earned the invested back into the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of housing.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the hotel design four stars pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in ostrov or tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a franchise of pytloun," said the businessman number one last year.
"This sale of licences for the opening of hotels helped in large part the fact win the involvement of the 'entrepreneur of the year'," adds grateful pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec in the vicinity.
"The people I recognized on the street, I still felicitaban often and, I must say, that was very pleasant," recalls.
Without doubt, recommends to everyone who wants to try any company involved in the competition.
But it is not necessary to win, but that participation is beneficial.
Claims that, so far, still lives of contacts and, without the competition, perhaps had not obtained.
"with some people that I met with the competition I started to work normally."
The fame associated with success, in his view, also included in employees.
In total around 70.
"I have seen that show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that got the general recognition."
"It is not, not least, my own personal success, but that is the result of the hard work of all the team."
"It is my name that appears on the front page," says today Lukáš modestly pytloun.
To my successor I wish a year reassured that we have had in farmet
The euphoria of victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that farmet has now past the worst.
The owner of the company farmet, Karel žďárský, was awarded first prize in the latest edition of the competition for Vodafone "company of the year" last year in the "home" seeing in Prague.
The jury was their efforts, with those who managed to make a small technical workshop in Česká skalice in a law firm with turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize had not only said to me, but all of my collaborators and improved our confidence in the fight against the competition," said the winner of last year.
The history of the company farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the State proposed to the father of Karel žďárský leasing a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, did not hesitate too; resigned in the company that constructed and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father in piles of plastic.
Soon after, began to specialize in presses of vegetable oil.
Eight years later became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the centre of Europe.
They won a greater presence also among the public unskilled following success in the competition in the media.
"not only our customers started to regard the brand farmet as significantly better, but also the foreign partners began to appreciate the cooperation with a company that won a greater success in their country," said Karel žďárský.
Last year perhaps was not in farmet only a sample of the euphoria of victory.
Also got credit for commercial results until 2008 and in 2009.
And the year 2009 was the year harder for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many, have led the companies pause their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new engines or engine technologies.
"We, obviously, we return this situation."
"The revenue fell by 40%, we had to limit the production and even had some layoffs," explains Karel žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, monitor the situation and kept the profits of the company, though at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where farmet not cut expenditure on research and development.
"with the subsidies we have built a centre for research and training activities, will strengthen the presence in the international market and obtained excellent assessments in national shows," says žďárský.
Everything indicates that have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expect to bring a sense of victory, but in an atmosphere more level-headed," says Karel žďárský.
A survey uncovered ridiculous rules.
The survey of absurdity is part of the year for the fourth time in the tournament business.
He has already made some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring the administration to documents that officials can access online.
The decision is adopted more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration called a text from the commercial register, although their officials can be accomplished with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security no longer will an extract from trade register when out of the impositions of the insured," said the spokesman for čssz Jana buraňová.
The aim of the absurdity of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must respect businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and to try to erase those that are absurd.
This year, form part of the tournament for the fourth time publishing business hospodářské noviny and begins to create fashion also among the general public.
While the edition last year with the involvement of three thousand voters this year virtually reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have plenty of several legal obligations that must be respected just to trade.
"perhaps in number of documents to the declaration of taxes we are first of the world," says Karel havlíček of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules is a stated objective of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement, especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, the Czech Republic is in the position 74ª, i.e. eight posts worse than last year.
The absurdity of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and each year in the same way.
Anyone can suggest any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when it closes the competition.
The proposals might be made to the website www.firmaroku.cz. later, the organiser of the contest to choose seven candidates for the "antipremio" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that receives more votes.
For the survey this year there were more than a hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that are meaningless.
The examples them both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "rose" of the competition was framed, for example, the requirement for vehicles to the maintenance of roads and motorways pay tolls or that employers with 20 employees, two offices and two bathrooms painted every two years the walls.
The list of the 1970s proposals this year is published in the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place in early November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event at the usually involved Celebrities from political and social.
This year, for example, attended this act of tender Eva svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce in the Republic.
"economic prosperity cannot stand if the state puts continuously obstacles to entrepreneurs, so my aim is to eliminate every year a minimum of 30 paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," announced by the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations are not left in tatters.
In 2007, what more annoyed people was the duty of the employer of communicating with an advance of three days in the business office of the area of operation, the intention of taking a post to a show or exhibition.
This obligation is removed in the new law.
The requirement that ended up in second place in the number of votes in 2007, namely the communication to the office to work for part of its foreign workers of the journeys of up to 30 days, it was deleted in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the back.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for the physiotherapists have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two speaking of soil.
That is why, this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying that he had removed the obligation to have a fridge.
A new category recognizes the socially responsible companies
It valued the green projects, humanitarian, educational and sporting.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the competition of hospodářské noviny is category called company responsible for the year 2010.
The role of this competition is to support responsible undertakings and fair.
"In this way we want to support companies that take care of the impact of their activity on the environment and supporting activities socially responsible," said Patrik bartholdy, regional director of the firm " s mobile operator Vodafone, organizer and patron of the contest, as in the case of competition of the rebel of the year.
For this new subdivision special edition this year - the main company Vodafone 2010 ran firms for whom commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of every one of them is inspiration and we would write a separate article.
Although the type of activities vary between a completely and another, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that offer.
In one case, for example of disabled people, in other of the personal problems and health of employees.
Among the 14 rose throughout the Republic stood, for example, the company praguense of software et netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company isolit-bravo, already seven years being the main aportador funds to sponsor to disabled children.
In poděbrad, a stationery shop that we are particularly concerned about the health problems of their workers, who make up more than 70% of the workforce; so was awarded the title of company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the tender Vodafone company of the year fell to third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the company accountant miryz soft, which cut the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title also was granted because purchase primarily to manufacturers Czechs, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our activities of production and administration produce the least possible impact on the environment," says the entrepreneur miluše ryznarová.
The company enlogit configuration of the region of engines also believes in the health of their employees and, with each laptop offered a chair and teclados ergonómicos; furthermore, it supports the work from home and their business events used catering services of a local company protected.
"furthermore, we support the grant person in distress, that help in particular to the local Roma community," says a representative of the company suchý Ondřej.
It also stands in good place with a mention the company praní laundry to čištění in the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive bonuses of a particularly influencing their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement in qualifications and leisure," says Josef strapáč, of the company to build bruntál czasch, winner in the region of moravia-silesia.
In the category of company responsible for the year was appointed automatically to all the regional rose the Vodafone company of the year that responded to the questions in the form of inclusion and sent before 15 August organisers.
The organizers got rid of the assessment forms that were not complete or mistaken.
"If the representatives of the companies contestants did not respond to questions, could not participate in the company of the year, but are not descalificados - the" main "Vodafone company of the year."
"The individual candidates for this contest are not permitted, because it is a subdivision of the main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the consultancy bison & rose.
The police made arrests at a public auction on the building of the agricultural fund, in Pilsen area
The police against corruption made several arrests in the building of the agricultural fund in recent days.
The esposaron detectives to a local businessman in the media sector and the property entrepreneur luboš g.
Apparently, this attempt to manipulate a public auction under way for the restitution of the rights that ground auctioned it received a very precise.
Should pay for it to luboš G. half a million crowns.
"at the moment so I can only say that the police search a person for bribery during a public auction and tender," he told právo the head of the Attorney General of Pilsen area antonie zelená, adding that by the time cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police soltó the operator of 46 years.
On the way in which could influence the public auction, given the little official information, so you can only speculate.
The spokesman of the agricultural fund lubomíra černá answered questions of právo saying that the police carried out the arrest in the headquarters of Pilsen area, and it was at a public auction.
"This is a client, not one of our workers," he added.
According to černá, the public auction is called "call for proposals for transfer of land in accordance with the law of the land" and are made when a number of interested parties in relation to the ground.
"these people, during the call, offer more than the his restitution, which must be transferred before announcing the value of the ground."
"in terms of the offers, it determines the order of purchasers and, later, the agricultural fund transfers to the person offering the increased supply," said the spokesperson of the fund.
Luboš G. had information about who was to present the collection and, given that the time is interested person because acquired various rights of restitution, proposed to stakeholders on the ground that they will not be participating in the auction.
For this favour, was taken on a Commission.
That would explain that, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money on top.
Luboš G. had contacts in the heart of Pilsen area since long ago.
It did in the case of the former head of the PF Václav sankot, who was accused by disposing of the replacement of areas to which it had already made a decision to construction.
For example, luboš G. has just obtained the fund some areas earmarked for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where they should build a great road to the industrial borská pole.
Later, the changed very beneficial to the magistrate for a House in the historic centre of the city with a much more.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the land would sealed off the building.
The families have to pay some additional costs of several hundreds of Crowns per month
The homes will have to pay since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, accessories for heating and, in some cases, rent.
Consequently, the families will have to pull out of the bag, starting in January, several hundred kronor a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases at a 4.6%, gas around 2% in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of district heating.
The rise of the electricity for the families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns a year more than now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced prices, because it has growing support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaics.
However, the gas means moderately, especially at a time when more used to heat and, therefore, the greater the consumption.
In this case, must also have a couple of hundred crowns a year more.
While electricity and gas are implemented across the country, the price of district heating varies from place to place.
The price rise is mainly the largest municipality.
For instance, the homes of Pardubice or of Hradec Králové pay since January, for the central heating about 50 crowns more per month, while families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Residents in Prague also will have to bear an increase of 9% of the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increased the rent of the infrastructure.
If the lease does not vary, the praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest rates, both will become more expensive a 7.4%.
Can substantially increase the cost of hiring 450 flats are at present renting in Prague, where the regulation ends in January.
For example, the company byty ICC, which has engines in nad Labem around 2,500 flats, raise the rent since January at up to 100%.
The company will lead to the courts to those who are not in accordance with the new lease.
Rents, which benefit the residents of around 300 flats, could increase next year to 10%.
The young Czechs emborrachan with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because for effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks which may end up in health-care young drinkers with a lower age to 15 years.
The children who have left them lying on the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover because they are not an exception.
This reflects the experience of doctors who have such cases in hospital admissions of paediatrics.
"drinking beer or wine is out of fashion, because it takes much in emborracharles."
"now the fashion are alcoholic beverages strong," indicates to právo the head of the hořovice paediatric hospital in the centre of Bohemia, luděk Pelikán.
"When cogerle buys a bottle to his father in the alacena, can be whisky, but these are usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it lessens with juice and that does not smell so much," explains.
This is also the spokesperson of the University Hospital motol, Eva jurinová.
"normally, we are generally talking about Fernet or rum."
"These are alcoholic beverages modern, particularly among schoolchildren."
"in some cases, use spirit that pick up at home," adds jurinová.
According to the head Pelikán, drinkers are 13 and 14 years the usually occur in hospitals.
Before hořovice, where working from this year, worked for a decade in paediatrics at motol, where ambulances took young people from the nearby areas.
"A girl had to join perhaps four times."
"began at 12, when the brought with 3.5 of alcohol in the blood, as well as a mixture of Ecstasy," the doctor of the Department on this case.
"It was at the festival of Holešovice in a feast of dance."
"What is interesting is that his mother and was surprised that his daughter wiped off 48 hours," are shocked the head.
It is precisely the lack of interest from parents or even its clear tolerance towards drink by their children, which is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts say that, in the case of children, cannot be talking about dependence.
"We understand by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with the company, which is not produced in children."
"in those who drink alcohol, more needs to be a social environment or family failed systematically," explains the head Pelikán.
According to the spokesman jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic motol is hospitalizaron until mid-November 40 children drunk.
However, the statistics show only that come with a serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
The young drinkers who, after the medical, are at home with parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children just meet after school and drink firewater, to Pelikán three seasonal ups and downs that include: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"in this circumstance, drink for the bad marks or, on the contrary, are celebrating the start of the holiday."
"on the day of the witches, I have come to see in admisiones until seven children drunk at the time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who spend the night in therapy under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with injecting a whey with glucose and with the nutrients you need to.
"They have been much better, because after the troubled night, get out well and not hurts anything."
"only are confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that, often, patients lose the good humour at least when they see the expenses which have generated.
The ambulance and the hospital in a room for patients serious comes at a cost of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of teaching them, when in the visit mine directly to children how much it has cost them and that they would have to spend the entire summer on a work for young people to ganaras enough to pay that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his view, perhaps as a regressive measure that often give people the cost of treatment, it does not in the case of children who drink.
Two l-159 jets are for the first time in hands outside in Spain
Two l-159 jets for a total of five, for which the Czech Defence Ministry replaced the plane Casa c-295m, sailed on Tuesday to Seville, where is the manufacturer of the aircraft home - EADS.
It is the first time that a system of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the moment, only were abroad for flights or practices.
This is the version biplaza l-159t1, that so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flying.
The three remaining planes are the monoplaza l-159.
They still kept in Aer vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company omnipol, already took on them last week.
Jan peješk, of the Department of Defense press, suggests that it is not yet clear when they physically aircraft of vodochody.
"The aircraft monoplaza l-159, by contrast, were separated from the planes repaired some time ago, without investment or additional contributions by the ministry."
"The biplaza l-159t1 were in its current state," he told právo pejšek.
He added that the army is not left without biplaza aircraft, since in May 2009, the army signed with Aer vodochody a contract on a scale of 200 million kronor for the construction of four devices to biplazas l-159 unnecessary.
One of the new aircraft has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to pejšek, EADS vowed that the planes will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"in the contract is clearly indicate that the company EADS is that removing the l-159 jets and which will form the basis for the practice of pilots from NATO countries."
"therefore, depends on the buyer to decide how to use it in this context," says pejšek.
The newspaper hospodářské noviny published before that time, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the l-159.
The exchange of five l-159 by a plane home and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the sale and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defence claims that the exchange promotes the export of future l-159 abroad.
The Czech army he gave to Aer 72 aircraft and only used 24, for what it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft home possibly to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Czech Defence Ministry to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft making a European tendering and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three home and the latter should arrive at the airport praguense of kbely in 14 days.
An index finger longer than the cancelation indicates a lower risk of cancer
The men have the highest rate that cancel are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a studied published Wednesday in the British journal of cancer.
Could they depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results indicate that the length of the finger on can be a test of the risk of prostate cancer, in particular for men aged up to 60 years," said the co-author of the study Professor Ros eeles, of the Institute for cancer research at the University of WARWICK.
Consequently, the finger could help predict which men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as health problems, according to family indicates eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, provided the review with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the índica finger of the right hand more quickly than the override.
They just as likely to suffer prostate cancer that 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with longer than the finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men aged less than 60% reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the width of two fingers in question, in the prenatal period, reflecting different levels of the hormones for which it is exposed foetuses in the womb.
A lower level of testosterone corresponds with longer.
Previous studies suggested that testosterone can influence the development of prostate cancer.
The great genetista Czech, and former President of the National Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav pačes, said at the same time that you are familiar with the study, but it seems that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can "prove completely."

The bullets can be set to explode not only when golpeen objective, but in any point which is in its missile trajectories.
You can use against enemies that lie behind a barrier, a wall or a front.
Indeed, you cannot use a normal protection and, when rain is releasing its murderous metal chips, can be crucial in the battle.
According to Richard audette, who spoke on the development of the xm-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry which uses a technology "intelligent."
"The soldiers the manipulated so that are objective, all point to the same his laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a line of precise and, in the same, corrects the projection and pulls the trigger."
"say measured 543 metres."
"when it hits the trigger, the gun is loaded and launches the missile to a distance of 543 metres, one, two or three metres," audette says.
Move 400 jobs
The consortium Fujitsu raises its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will change their place of work of his former office building in the marienbader platz in bad homburg the star park.
The Japanese firm Fujitsu raises its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
As was the giant of specialist in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year in his former office building in marienbader platz in bad homburg the star park, a vast complex of offices in the street lyoner Landstrasse in the district of niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term other 100 extra staff of the consortium, which previously were scattered around the region, alojarán there.
The offer is highly attractive, then the collective office in Star park will promote the way to work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only occupant in bad homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner said, "in franfkurt-niederrad we have found a central site with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new moving to a major industry in the region yesterday brought joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
The head of department of economy of Frankfurt, Markus frank (CDU) said that it has won a "global player."
This is a "wonderful recognition at the site."
Fujitsu is founded in the city, the settlement is a major boost for niederrad.
The mayor of bod hombruger, Michael korwisi (the Greens) who regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management reported earlier in the city on their intention.
"Of course we have offered our assistance to the company," stated korwisi.
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the property in marienbader platz did not change in difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons producieron the fall.
So now there is a great place to hide in the famous.
"I hope that the owner and the arrendador building will show cooperative."
The House previously used by Fujitsu in the rathausplatz and neighbouring "kleine vertikale 'part to spare the buildings of marienbader platz from ten years ago of a controversial project to build the resort city.
As a joint project of the city and a private business projects between the station and the city, was a new entry to the city, which is responsible for the critical mass in the building that previously used the gaps as parking facilities and with regard to the level of the buildings.
In 2001 have been installed the Department of business and investment valuation, the producer of software for reservations systems, start Amadeus, as well as United Siemens with the home computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, a building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group in Frankfurt, Deutsche immobilien-chancen-gruppe along with Morgan Stanley real estate and a year later resold to Spanish falcon real estate investments SA in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, originally from Tokyo, is acknowledged as the third largest global provider of it.
Have companies, for example of computers and servers, and also provides the services needed.
The branch in rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, anyhow Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu technology solutions is setting up from bad homburg in frankfurt-niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu services and a company with the name of TDs.
That is why we have rented 7,000 square metres in the office building of star park.
The former compound of the 1920s, its name refers to its hand in the form of star among others, is home to the central partnership for Electrotechnical and electronics.
Amazon cancels the server - threats against Assange
The distress comes increasingly of WikiLeaks.
The provider of Internet services Amazon has removed the platform of revelations of his server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of diplomatic documents secret.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, apparently arrested in England.
The platform of WikiLeaks' is always the butt of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and now seek a homeland of the Internet in Europe.
The famous American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls to other countries and companies for a boycott of WikiLeaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, which is in the list of people wanted by Interpol, must be detained in Britain, according to an article.
"WikiLeaks expelled the server of Amazon."
"talk freely in the country of freedom," reported the activists of the revelations by the messaging service Twitter Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had eliminated the WikiLeaks documents from its home base.
The Internet activists had tried in the publication of secret diplomatic documents at the web services Amazon to face the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, WikiLeaks explained: "Well, we will commit our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "should stop selling books."
Amazon was stopped by the use of his servant by WikiLeaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported CNN as a call to the office of Lieberman.
The Presidency of the Council of the Senate for the security of the country had threatened to boycott, Amazon reported the British "guardian."
"I wanted that Amazon take these measures earlier, before the previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also demanded that the platform also banned in other countries the use the server.
"The process illegal, monstrous insensitive and WikiLeaks threatens our national security and threaten the life in the world," it said in a statement from the independent senator.
"any company, be it American or foreign, must help WikiLeaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper the independent, "the Australian 39 years has been arrested in Britain, Scotland Yard will be familiar with the site.
The activist of the Internet has constantly research in Sweden as a plot of their enemy.
The spokesman for WikiLeaks, kristinn hrafnsson, said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why there are fears for the safety of Assange said hrafnsson.
Therefore, it is still not disclosed the location of the founder of WikiLeaks.
Hrafnsson reacted clearly statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the head of the WikiLeaks' should be tried for treason and must be implemented.
In Canada, said an adviser to the Prime Minister Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should "murdered" and Obama could use a "drone."
Between the White House and Assange grows a long dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American President Barack Obama described as "ridiculous and absurd" Assange has called for the resignation of the Secretary of State, where she is responsible for order recently to diplomats who involucrasen in spying.
"I am not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a type with a website," said Gibbs.
"our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far stronger than his web site."
The American Government has to prove the effectiveness of the protection of their databases in general.
Russell travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Center on terrorism, was appointed commissioned one-off, announced the White House.
So travers is responsible for developing "the major structural reforms', which are necessary in the light of the leak of WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the information on the government and to protect it.
In addition, the administration announced that to deal with security of dissidents and activists, should jeopardise the publication of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything possible to make contact with them," said State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of glacial
In the "gelato university" in Bologna heladeros prepare in the best times of year.
The basic course of three days in future heladeros has the greatest influx and visitors from all over the world.
In fact how come all the ice cream?
The gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere produced the cream according to all the rules of the art of the Italian ice cream.
The gelataio draws with a espátula the ice cream counter, it spans the barquillo and it.
For that, we do not have to go to anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "gelato university" of the Italian company carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the University of ice cream with the congeladora in 2003, so that the cream of the horror of their machines to meet the high ideals Italians everywhere.
The basic course of three days in future heladeros has the greatest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses more days on the ice cream of chocolate and practices in the heladería in our own backyard.
In these times of crisis, some people are contemplating a new career, other risks in the soft ice cream its vague desires.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from every continent, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
To Jacky, professor of this art of California, thrilled the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European product quality in the land of ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is an adviser to companies and wants to create something in some years work aggravating.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a heladería in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream of its bars, and a housewife, Julia, is because their children adore Italian ice cream.
The master heladero Luciano Ferrari explains to participants then the qualities ideals of perfect ice.
It is not convincing, only his good taste, but also his mildly sedosa and his good form.
Luciano has not forgotten their training or the 50-year-old cream of the upper house and mainly in the south of the country, "the Italian ice cream is simply the best, and so each crystal has something romantic."
The first step to drafting seems facilísimo.
Luciano takes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilising in a great batidora, that hot all with an electronic programme to 85 degrees and the time it enfría until four degrees.
Then opens the tap of the machine and leaves a basic pasteurized cream White, the basis for all kinds of ice cream of milk.
Suddenly, Professor question: does the ice cream will be only natural elements with or without estabalizador?
How can we give free rein to some want to see?
Luciano advises that 'minds on the job of the trends of the time.
The making of horror "not only of natural ingredients', to the best has used stabilisers, mainly a natural product, probably Goma guar, of frijol guar.
Of course that it can be made ice cream without stabilising, it need only to buy a day, place it in a bag and the customer morderá a resounding ice cream of granite.
Permitting some variations in the basic mass.
Flavourings are used.
As regards the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients they buy in the section of fruit or in that of candy in the supermarket.
Moreover, there are powders and toothpaste.
"all suppliers may try to foist ingredients syrups in their merchandise."
"However must undergo once."
Whether with sorbetes of fruit to sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the cream of ice cream in the basic bill White, who with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants could use the heladoras.
Luciano allowing them to produce more and four different types of ice cream of vanilla, chocolate, moca and hazelnuts, with or without eggs in the basic bill, with more or less whiff of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Doing the same experiment also with types of ice cream to fruit.
That should know better not necessarily depend on more aroma of tofe or more fruit purée.
It is not necessary for the ice cream of hazelnuts in nuts, if contains more hazelnuts.
The working group adored by the horror of kiwi fruit that uses more fruit, less water and less of stabilising.
First a balanced blend highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The drafting of ice cream is a problem of artimética: used the peach purée with a lot of sugar, we must lower the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe.
For the lemon ice needed an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano exposes a tool with which sets the amount of sugar from the types of fruit (measurement of vinicultor for oechsle in the grape must).
Thankfully the tables give account.
Producing ice cream needs no more than the actual implementation, as before.
Not only help the utensil to the drafting of the automatic basic mass.
There is also a tool, which is simultaneously the mixture of horror and are prepared to temperature.
In spite of everything, the full automation stays out on the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustaf was channel itself and colleagues of top-down with fruit purée, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
"in all classes," says the master Luciano, "is just a question of time goes something like this."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European Food Safety Authority has taken root in the industry that is with transgenic plants.
Now this matter what the group of experts testbiotech, which is considered an Institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"looks like a conspiracy theory but it has been well documented," said Christoph then, director of testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry kuiper, the director of the group of experts from EFSA on genetically modified plants, and other expert from EFSA is employed for years in the ilsi association.
The pools like Monsanto, nestle or Bayer the costean.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the rules for verification of EFSA of genetically modified plants, which is a clear conflict of interests, criticises then.
The provisions of EFSA are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of ilsi and imitate the spelling of the company, which in reality is controlled by the Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that testbiotech criticises a collision of interests.
So, recently, a senior manager of EFSA was without the support or the time for transition to the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with this his side.
Recently, also mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (mdr) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, which carried out the oficinal general environment, as well as a far-sighted Member of the EU.
However, EFSA cannot recognize no conflict of interest.
He appeals to all the formal data, also to some of the industry, provided they are of a high technical quality, are ranked in a report.
There are experts working in EFSA that do not have any contact with the industry.
But should expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in us.
It is called himself as a neutral forum to experts and science, industry and politics, among others, to the risk assessment for biotechnology without the commissioning of lobby.
On this subject, independent experts, as then, criticise currently allow transgenic plants without investigating the food for animals and that is not checked the influence of the genetically modified plants in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize in agriculture," says then.
The current practice is to verify only proteinas isolated, but not the whole transgenic plant, which provides reliable results.
"If we do not seek the risks, how will find?" asks, accuser, then.
Angelina hilbeck does likewise.
The scientific investigates since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and currently working on the technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly in the US and in Europe, influence or discredit scientists critics.
So, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For businesses, the critical studies have not been covered by a rule.
"The industry controls research of security," keeps hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli gsell has achieved some, in total around 400 kilos.
The Monday before the Stuttgart, with the tuba to the event.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is familiar: in September bulldozers and began to remove a large piece of the North wing.
The land of Stuttgart will never again be the same: thousands and thousands demonstrated against the S21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As was precintado, most of the wing is hizó rubble.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a stone fluffy Rugova, placed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, has 43 years.
It has secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthuses: "a cheap and poor, simple and natural."
As once said, has olido the smoke cigarettes.
It still does not know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have the time.
Uli gsell also.
The trail of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in TUBINGEN in a former munitions storehouse of the French navy, where Manuel rongen erected its stone stein-reich.
The man is 44 years old with stones.
He bought everything from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would have, molerían the gravilla or send to the dustbin," says in her office, a little wooden house that once served as a guard.
He insulted and threatened, explains, when, in September, appeared in the newspapers, that had bought the remains of the North wing to the derribos.
The spoke with the enemies of the 21s for several days.
And they explained that it could not do absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And when they did, then it was the most sensible, when the stones then followed.
Some 200 enemies of S21 took the mazizo 80 kilos cut, with a price for piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took as memory but also with the hope of sending it back in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a burden of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the forest, the rest long ago that was sold.
Owner of gardens, gardener paisajista, commissioned projects.
They arrived from all sides and took what they could be put in the boot and above.
The stone of Stuttgart the momentum for long has become "the wall" or in the definition of kräuterbeeten.
"in reality this stone is nothing special," says rongen.
"If it were not for the political component."
Amounts to his SUV, a tour by his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
Studied law, interrupted his studies and later biology, is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And is a lover of the stones.
Aloja to 4,000 tonnes of stone.
Transported their treasures across Germany.
He claims to be the biggest tratante of ancient stones.
Slams.
In the snow is artistic stones of arenisca picadas.
"pertencieron at bridge of Dresden marienbrücke," explains.
Caliza Alba, yellow, warm, enthuses.
"My dear stone."
The path crosses the forest.
Says a lot: arenisca red, a piece of the station at Karlsruhe.
And on.
"beautiful travertino."
In the past, mazizos belonged to the gallery of the neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories travertino, yellow of the head of police in Stuttgart, red granite church Sankt blasien toba, hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, effort, what sweat.
When rongen thinks as the carved stones and moved with a simple gear and a carreta, feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something were to be destroyed."
It has not become rich, in all immensely rich.
But now 14 people had to be done tratante of stones, as well canteros, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a vidriero and a gardener has been set up in the forest.
"We are working hard, but is satisfactory," says the man who is in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon we will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fight of talent around large potential
Queen active influx in the buffet.
16 students charging around the last soup, tomato and sweets.
The Technical University of braunschweig and the car manufacturer vokswagen invited to a workshop to students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they talk about the car of the future with the workers of VW and then learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a fight in some of the best minds in cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to hire the most talented students from universities, before they enter the labour market and are employed by others.
And as universities give no indication about the skills of their pupils, is getting an inkling as to the exceptional talents in practical projects and captarlos.
The second day of project at the technical University of braunscheig, the consortium wins to the talent.
A department of staff shared pens, gomitas and carpetas with the logo of VW.
Explains to the excited young talent programmes of practice and work for students and shows their paths in the consortium.
Nico successful in brokering of the Technical University of braunschweig leads the project with VW.
Sees advantages for both sides: "students come into contact with the industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW may know students, a closer look at the candidates interesting and treated as prospective workers."
Some partnerships, says successful in brokering, are not rare.
The novel aspect is that students are desired so directly.
"The main point was previously was in the technical projects," says successful in brokering.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming more severe.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If we do not have to be announced and, above all, to achieve a highly qualified workforce.
All the students in the engineering disciplines are in a good situation.
According to the German engineers' Association (vdi 'in German), in October there were 40,000 jobs vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognósticos of the vdi, this vacuum of engineers to climb even higher.
In the auditing and advisory KPMG Roman dykta is in charge of the hunt for talent.
Organises expensive recruitment events, such as the career KPMG, a kind of modern yincana, in which the participants have to find their way through the coordinated of GPS.
The company wants to send eight students very promising to America the following year.
Participants also can watch the subsidiaries of KPMG and learn about the company.
He decides who should go in two rounds of choice in the exit.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants is to us.
Universities are increasingly in selecting and polishing the high potential of universities, according to dykta.
"with the race we draw attention to the mob."
"The simple journey alone we fell short."
For the cazatalentos dykta notes yield results.
"until now we have a similar action in the last year, with all participants."
"Some are near their end, and they want to work with us," she says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, are also chasing, above all, small and medium-sized enterprises, with its traditional job fairs.
"We are trying to get students in the specialist trade."
"something about intersolar," says sitha stübe, in charge of personnel for the manufacturer of solar technology solarworld.
The company Bonner has about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently on the web page of the company appear 35 vacant posts.
"It is still very complicated filling vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
A way shorter is contact with the teachers at the university.
Solarworld works with several colleges, for example, the University of freiberg.
"teachers are advising that can practice with us or make their thesis.
There are expensive advertising campaigns for the solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to lobby with other advantages: friendly staff, hierarchy and communication is quite comfortable.
"a large consortium normally cannot give it," says stübe, charged with staff.
In the search for a job, the money is no longer the most important thing.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good chances for promotion.
According to a study by the great place to work instituts, solarworld holds 55 square between 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute produces an annual list of the top suppliers of German jobs.
For what question the employee how pleased they are with work and with the environment in the same and you look at the pre-conditions for employees.
Stübe, which staff also hopes extra points in his rating for their candidates to work.
"I believe that the applicant is especially in external ratings to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner kriegler of the deutschen employer branding akademie advises businesses that want a long-term strategy that is gaining a reputation as an employee.
Advises his clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be as attractive employer goes through its own employees," you say.
In the jargon of the field is called domestic employer branding, promotion of corporate identities within the workforce.
"some employees happy are the best ambassadors."
When it comes to the people and I identified with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It is like a game with gang," said kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the US State of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years no new oil drilling.
The government in Washington issued a formal ban and it lifted its previous plans were so sweeping.
Also in the Atlantic coast remain closed new drilling at the moment.
It announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, who will be in place at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater oil rig "horizon" in April.
Before the disgrace that claimed the lives of 11 workers and provoked the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and the industry.
The supporters they reduce dependence on the US of new supplies of oil from abroad.
Up to now has not been fully clarified as yet of who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the Bay.
In the center of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with millions of lawsuits.
A Commission of Inquiry by Obama will present their results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Interior Minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling following the explosion.
Then, various consortia peteroleros submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster using controls tougher regulations and safety costs.
Currently the competent supervisory authorities, who have been accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, root-and-branch reform.
Obama announced parallel that will close the tax loopholes for the consortia profitable oil and gas.
The industry announced publicly that the total production in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
"The plans by the government are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the outcome of the current survey from business adviser bdo - before the ban on mining on Wednesday.
American energey Alliance complains of the insecurity in the sector: "nobody knows what is exactly with regulation."
Investments in new mining projects which extend so far, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland broken-down
The water from the rivers is márrón oil, smells like a petrol pump: millions of litres of oil spills have shattered nature in the Ogoniland Nigerian.
People live in the theft, corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
To akpobari celestine does well.
"do not canséis," it is pleasing to the environmental activist to journalists: "today will go down enough oil before your eyes."
The Nigerian 37 years has managed to take pictures of boys vadeando in water until the chest with the glare of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: with the gaudy glitz of water, the scene seems almost Nice.
It is that on the surface floats Brown stains.
Here before caught prawns in handfuls, explains Esther badom in the side of the river bodo-jetty.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago was poured in the formidable wetland an incredible amount of oil by a broken pipe.
Fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and based in Ogoniland, is regarded as one of the most apestadas regions in the world.
In the course of the journey from the river that runs through mangrove forests, the widespread devastation is obvious.
Instead of water, the boat removes a soup Brown, who submerges his hand in the water, pulling a full of oil.
The raices of trees of mangrove forests amounts from the soil as obscure sticks of regaliz, sadly aislan the palm trees that clash and posted their Palmas.
In vain he sought flocks of birds, as if they were in the watershed as always: is the barrier of silent, expands in it a sort of ghastly calm of a previous paradise smell of petrol.
"What happens here is a struggle," says green, huraño, celestine akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni is waged a battlefield for years: stormed here for over 60 years the first European explorers, here was the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed here had to put up its first factory the consortium Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of the oil.
Yet it is nowadays forbidden the return of the businesses in Ogoniland: while daily pumped more than two million barrels of black gold across the delta region, a size three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable to the consortium.
Every 200 metres sobresalían platforms of steel as bizarre sculptures of the water: "arbolitos Christmas affectionately call" to the heads of the drilling.
Have up to 50 years, the majority have a total corrosion.
At every turn failure a cabezal, does akpobari, then there is a constant pinch of oil in the water.
According to assessments of the experts, have been made more than two billion litres in 50 years in the Delta ecosystem: year after year, the amount of oil it runs, as in the averia vessel 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the largest ecólogicas disasters in the history of humanity.
Who is responsible for the lasting environmental region, lidiará with it.
While the consortium of Shell and the organised theft of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists view the warheads into low-enriched to break point and the pipes with losses as the main source.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the conventional world, liberate the scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: only the defects of the pipes are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In a place far away seems forgotten, appears a garage full of oil under the open sky, winged between mangrove forests are: naked and covered in oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flamea a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is hot in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
Firstly, the petrol runs through the pipes in the shaft, later the pipeline of leaking oil and diesel finalemente goes.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily until four barrels of diesel 300 litres: "give us 34 naira," around $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta advantage the fuel shortages in one of the biggest oil states of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only a single refineria.
With the cheap price of diesel and only 40 euros-céntimo per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: reduce the value of its raw materials.
It stems from "the bunkers," which trucaron the network of pipes that crosses Ogoniland: according to the experts, this step will lose at least 16 million litres of oil a day in the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the interim bonus material stored it refines clearly illegally: organised criminal networks, which are also political and military, remain the best hand in aljibes and sell it in the world market.
The activist akpobari considered purely academic debate over whether the environmental catastrophe is due more to the handling of the people or the poor way of production.
"If oil companies are not behaving as invaders and not have destroyed completely natural habitat for fish, would not have sabotage or theft, or refinerias illegal."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered especially by Shell to the point that only a deduction of consortium: "Perhaps it is better to have other nationalities, such as China."
Michael is getting nervous.
"It is high time that desaparezcáis," says the muscular ölmann.
"The soldiers can come at any minute."
If the special unit of army buys the illegal refiners, it threatens to arrestarlos, if not with a painful bribery.
The soldiers from the North also want, like all Nigerians, take advantage of the raw material.
"This doomed invention has done pieces to our country," says akpobari.
The researchers detected defects of dangerous factory in the engines of the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible defect of plant, which can produce "a catastrophic error in the engine."
The airline qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of the engine.
The passengers on the qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing at the beginning of November had far more luck than you can imagine: the Australian air safety authorities said thanks to their research a major issue of safety in the engines of some A380, and warn of a possible defect of factory.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: links to manguitos, it can cause fissures by fatigue or cracks, authorities announced the atsb in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic error in the engine."
This affected the engines made by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft from the series A380.
Among the qantas-airbus who had to make a hard landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline begins half against the manufacturer of British turbines.
Filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney which was to facilitate more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, chief executive of qantas, declared that his airline will demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the marks of the engine lost pieces and its branch is waning.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the kind of petrol as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be reinstated.
The Australian researchers announced that will further evidence of security to the superjumbos fitted with engines affected.
The recommendation of security is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin dolan, spokesman for atsb.
The problem of security has become sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the apparatus of qantas, the airline kept its fleet A380 on earth for many weeks.
Singapore airlines took about three of its 11 A380 temporarily in land.
Lufthansa restored the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This plane with dual deck is the largest passenger jet in the world.

Thousands of mourning for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought in the miners buried, started by dead after many explosions in a mine.
Still have not been able to find the bodies, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
For nearly two weeks was held intense explosion in the mine Pike River near the town of greymouth.
29 miners of the ages of 17 and 62 years were buried in the mine.
It introduced a probe in the place of misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, any rescue team could go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense bang, authorities and experts utmost that there was no chance that the miners have survived.
There have not been able to recover the bodies so far.
Currently the relatives and friends are reminiscent of the deaths with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people have changed with the sunny brightness of the sun in greymouth in New Zealand island in the South.
Remain silent for two minutes.
In homage to the miners buried then put up 29 tables with helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photos and personal belongings, beneath clothing and tables of surf.
The ondearon flags at half-mast on government buildings in the country.
New Zealand waited to return the miners to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John key, the President of the government representatives, to the participants of the commemoration.
"but never returned home."
It may take the death of their son until they have seen their body, said lawrie drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Alongside the President of the government and the relatives of the victims attended a commemoration many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on 19 November were also buried miners of UK origin and South Africa.
Rescue workers began would simply die out a fire in the interior of the coal mine in the South Island of New Zealand.
As we have learnt the explosive gases, temperatures abrasadoras within the mine will descend, said Gary knowles, the upper end of the police, journalists.
At devil, warrior!
Does the Gore fit into the artistic film?
The director Nicolas winding refn is to explore the boundaries of the genre with his saga of battles "walhalla rising."
What will the public thought the Danish director Nicolas winding refn running "walhalla rising"?
A warrior vikingo prisoner with one eye (Mads mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills their enemies with struggles almost sobrehumanas, sounds ideal for young viewers seeking action bloody, precisely because our hero he likes to use brutal methods to kill and drive their enemies the strong their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, unojo, as is in fact, there is almost no word throughout the film and the other characters getting carried away by as much one or two sentences, or a couple of painful cries.
Otherwise silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying montuosos landscapes of Scotland, to the sidelines, offer the world vikingo of around a thousand years.
Rather, ideal for film-makers crecidos and interested in the existencialismo and movements of House very calmados.
When a film has several target groups it is a shame that cannot be ruled out each other.
The director winding refn considers its wild and trilogy on the hair drug trafficker "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses remade to make their works are for the general public with a bit of humour in the mainstream, or something less brutality of the art House.
A brain volume and a strong that stem cannot deter most followers of artistic film.
The majority of the fans of the action are dying of boredom, if unojo take a boat to Jerusalem with a force of cristioneros missionaries violent for reasons interpretable and remains stuck, an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrived to America and back to shut up there.
It is a pity that "walhalla rising" has not found film distributor in Germany and will only be printed in DVDs.
It is a calamity against the fantastic images, but also because, after the! and bloody façade is a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, it deserves some attention.
This film is not of dialogue or a logical action, all is atmosphere, a fevered dream turned into film.
And that is why there is no escape for viewers.
Refn condede is scarcely a moment of relaxation and their images glaciers and the dismal noise band of costs make him a noose around his neck, above all, the incredible hatred, that since the hearts of the characters is going towards him.
Only a small young rubio, who supports unojo, retains something as innocence, everyone else is owned by the IRA.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are not explain never becomes any time in a warrior out of hell for enemies and allies temporary, possibly in the Ambassador of the same.
The accounts for the downfall, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"walhalla rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, altered and wonder.
An experience.
Oh movements of Earth
The organization of nuclear energy IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country is refusing to comment on this subject to be controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September, 2007, at least four Israeli planes F-15 fighter R attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
Sits on the shore of Euphrates; the city more and closer, 30 kilometres is dair as-saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is about a reactor which was apparently the Syrians built with help from North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley from the river.
According to information from the intelligence service international USA to the CIA to the end of April 2008, is a reactor design flow under the name of the vicinity of el-kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium with which to build nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique only used for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation on video with satellite images blurred.
They had a computer animation for which they were the components of the reactor before the destruction, which was reduced a copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear plant in Yongbyon.
In addition were shown photographs that showed the building from the vicinity or from within.
He recently that the reactor was in operation, he says, but still was not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later the bombing, is just more well known that by that time, the puzzles are made with the time.
The former US President, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-kibar, but that hardly saw signs that the country had "a nuclear weapons program."
In Europe, several secret service agents would be even more cautious and only speak of a 'alleged reactor, "even consider" plausible "the presentation of the CIA.
They need a strong evidence base, as well as to the IAEA.
When asked what you had in front of a reactor, a senior diplomat from the UN responded in summer so concise that the IAEA has "enough material to take questions."
The Syrians were very quickly on the rubble of the alleged "crippled" military building and prepared the ground thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, a team of the IAEA under the previous chief inspector Olli heinonen found rastos of uranium in el-kibar, which had been made by people.
In addition the IAEA obtained satellite imagery on a Member State, of commercial sellers in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a value of the information presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs were not in the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity regardless.
Syria always hinted that had never had a secret nuclear programme or built one reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the analysis of the particles.
Since then damaskus refuses to discuss them, just as on the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden to a second inspection in el-kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the building bombed.
Israel keeps a tight silence.
"Never will comment on them," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and was "gradually transformed into a serious problem of credibility to the authorities," as one Western diplomat in high office corresponds with a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally there is a serious offence against the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, by the to the IAEA.
The IAEA believes three teams more as the key to progress in the clarification, which should be "functional" in connection with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not revealed publicly until the moment of what teams are treated, and what tasks they have, or if seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has appointed and internally to marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah, again from the vicinity of towns located.
The independent Institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near masyaf with satellite images, which will most likely be one of the objects suspects.
Possibly in or next to a military base, Syria from the entrance to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, says that the Syrian authorities fear a register that the US has asked the IAEA to spy military plants.
The detectives were nuclear alert on the teams thanks to the warnings of the secret service in the US.
Through satellite photos, the IAEA has evidence that moves material between the three places and the bucket on the side of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be associated with the production of fuel ."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," or uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor was Acciona with uranium that is enriched.
Where should come the uranium and where should break away later plutonium for bombs, to the central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There can be no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can recover, are found in three places.
As are the hundreds of cargo trucks of soil, no one has information on where remain the rubble.
The oiae unlikely the salt mine al-tibni, situated in the few miles from el-kibar to another part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians acknowledged in 1998 for his skill as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former inspector of the IAEA, the first linked with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images in the prestigious journal Jane 's intelligence review.
But the photos from the orbit show that the Syrians have made land movements in three separate places suspects and removed large containers after the IAEA request entry.
It may be a coincidence but hardly contribute to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, in the sector diplomat says that the IAEA has spent some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interests of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, damaskus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna last year relaxed with that the reactor was destroyed, so the issue does not have much urgency, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a kind of US Ambassador about so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous that nuclear authorities vienesas have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, which should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option that I am open in the future," but still falters.
This is very dangerous: this needs a majority of the Council of governance of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries there are not exactly eager to an escalation.
On the other hand, as thought a diplomat: "So what if at the end did not find anything?"
The love in the time of the War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the direction of his debut still nameless.
She has written the script, a love story between a Bosnia and Serbia.
No one knows much more about it, but this is enough for the unrest.
The rumour is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her rapist Serbs during the war in Yugoslavia.
The associations of Bosnian women protested quickly, which in the last minute was transferring some days of testing programmes in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has led in Hungary and post-productive stage, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic organization of female victims of the war he wrote to the Commissioner for the UN, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, weeks women offered a meeting in Hungary that rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says hasecic.
There are stories of love in the fields of rape, and the position of Jolie about it betrays the victims enough about the script.
His organization in accordance with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismiss Jolie as Ambassador, reports the guardian.
But what, exactly, Jolie has written to the scenes?
The Ministry of Culture Bosniak reading the script, granted after a tug-of-war a permit of recording in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author repeats that it pursues political purposes with his film, introduced with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the ugly consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains unclear.
The network is making a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: lovers were together before the start of the war and are to be found when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
It sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape falls torturer."
It is certain that the film of Jolie really begun before the war.
The pressure on it, says Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Currently can make peace with the hacker Hollywood: while the script is still in the Internet illegally, as many others.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon, at long last be good for the Irish.
No sign of distress
Instead, the home team dominates on their customers from Sweden, Finland and us.
The fans scream of joy as retumba music high, on the floor with their feet.
The club Bailey vibrates in the sudirlandés Cork, because the players are, and are, balls of pingpong to the glasses of beer from a distance of three metres
The bizarre spectacle called "beerpong," and the prize for the winner are 500 euros plus a plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Cup beerpong in January.
Cian tanner is a quiet, this bizarre game of drink and the discreet software in reality they are friends.
And the boy of 26 years trying to play with this, recreation of the spot, what would the future will bring.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in their plans, in January will be a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a hunch," she says.
"It is very far from home and I have no job."
At least: his girlfriend awaits him in Auckland, "threw a secured the job of his dreams as manager of events, it is perhaps a good sign," says the young and smiles.
Because of the poor prospects at home, two of the three brothers of tanners have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin operates today as an adviser you in londrés.
Young people are: on the island, there are many families as the tanners.
Irish 100,000 will abandon the country in the foreseeable future, forecast experts in economics and the Institute of social research ESRI of Dublin.
Until 2015 are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss to this small country with only 4.5 million people.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a migratory wave that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that trajó high welfare standards to the Irish, currently stretches melancholy.
The economic crisis confused young people in particular, Irish well trained, to which until now, everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and the social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
They all need that money is in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish times there are letters to the editor in droves of young immigrants, who complain that: "in Ireland all sound."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, will and lost our country and with it a whole generation."
"the last to shut the door."
Leanne caulfield, law student and President of the Union of Irish students appear sees a bright future because the government only is political and it offers prospects for the future to young people.
"lower minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the girl for 20 years.
Watching as their colleagues are not reumneradas practices to the following.
His biggest concern, explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen mclarnon are trying to see this issue positively.
Mclarnon organised the "workingabroadexpo," a festival offering a service on the issue of work abroad.
"for those who go to work, do abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
On his website feature photos of a boy played surf in Australia and another snowboard engaged in Canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not as doing so in the galeras, if not that entails freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán o 'donovan knows how it is to build something in another room.
Since no longer had anything to do for the engineer of 29 years, currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now raise a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January will be Hanover or to Berlin, the next project.
O 'donovan sees home only a few times because it works overtime to pay for a loan for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," says, as long ago for the first time I stepped on the doorstep of his home.
"earn money in Germany to a house in Ireland, where ever I am as well."
He laughs somewhat embarrassed and goes for rooms frost.
The tiny house is in an elegant residential area with gardens care at home, in the parked cars are big and expensive.
O 'donovan bought the home along with his sister four years ago by 380 000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a loan.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Do you have any fear of failing to credit?
O 'donovan thinks now serves hot tea and says: "I have children to feed and I am young; if anything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer t complaints that listens often today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, as far as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," she says.
"working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with this we are for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last big economic crisis was to England.
"after seven years came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
To Cian tanner likes these ideas.
Leave pending future and simply do as is life elsewhere.
Already worked a couple of years in London and why it was going to go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that he worries about it: the celebration of his 27 birthday Friday in Dublin.
Fears that could degenerate into a feast of farewell.
"only, not too many emotions," he says and gives a great pill to his beer.
"farewell, it sounds distressing."
"The better we call it a celebration of March, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Continue to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as the backing for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, he sees Brazil as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest survey of latinobarómetro made in 18 countries and published exclusively by the economist.
Given that the survey has been taken regularly since 1995, makes it possible to carry out a follow-up to the changes in attitudes in the region.
In the results of the survey this year, conducted in September and early October, highlights two issues.
The first is the relatively vibrant mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has risen considerably in various countries of the Pacific coast of South America look (table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen since a fallen 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a huge decline in output last year.
However, only half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries are in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (consult the graph 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region is extremely satisfied with the way democracy functions in practice in his country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 graph (3).
Around 34% said that they trusted Congress of his country and 45% in his government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America have seriously affected the support for democracy.
The fact that it has continued during the global financial crisis probably stems from the fact that many Latin American countries only were affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a network of social security more strong has helped to protect the poorest.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and that has been reduced again this year, up 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (consult the graph 4).
The good economic returns of Brazil and the popularity of the outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
That sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, most respondents in Latin America about the crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing the country (consult the graph 5).
Around 31% say that either they or a close relative, has been a victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced from 38% last year, and that is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns is reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable to the development, while in 2007 was only 56% (consult the graph 6).
About 58% agrees that the market economy is the only system that will allow his country develops, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and the 80% supports private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exerts greater leadership in the region, as the 19% of respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influential country deemed by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds that title in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Nicaragua.
Elections to the rubbish
No one expected that the general elections on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, further far worse that they feared the foreigners who are trying to help the country to pick up after their problems.
It introduced votes at the polls, some people voted several times, ballot papers lying in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups made homeless by the earthquake in January, move for the area trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, they gave up.
A dozen candidates for the presidential, including several of the more popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, declared that the elections were "relatively good in many ways."
The observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, said cautiously that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, revoke necessarily the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which according to its rivals is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing President, and with their candidate, jude célestin, should announce preliminary results on 7 December.
It is predicted that the desempate will convene in January.
We do not yet have lost all hope in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel martelly, a rapero, and mirlande manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in calling for the cancellation of the vote.
But they can still cause problems if the electoral authority states that Mr célestin, that has little or no support, has moved to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the cholera epidemic in the country and more than a million survivors of the earthquake is still living in tents, is expected to be a low voter turnout.
By the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so due to a lack of organisation.
Around 250,000 identity cards needed to vote still had not been distributed shortly before the election.
There is much at stake.
Aid donors see that the choice of a popular government and legitimate is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has become evident, I think the Haitians themselves.
Moving tiptoeing towards the centre
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has grown its ratings by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level recorded since his election in 2007.
Despite everything, we can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, continued to take responsibility for economic policy even after his wife version of him as president, had the habit of set budgets that infravaloraban tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple spend extra revenue at their discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs Fernandez lost their majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following the death of Kirchner because of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting Member of the Peronist movement in power have faced Ms Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which a Member gave her fist to another in the face and other Members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the budget by 2011.
"I am not going to discuss," said the President.
The 2010 budget, therefore, apply to next year, which will offer the President a margin of still greater in the spending thereof.
The economy is improving considerably: will probably grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the pay demands of the unions, situated close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, meant that the growth and poverty reduction their priorities, instead of controlling inflation.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made the indec, the Institute of statistics, adaptase official statistics of inflation.
Moderará is now the President Fernández these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
In addition, his officials say that they want to limit pay increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been fueled by high prices for Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for the very reason Ms Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore the financial ties of Argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused to advance a forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that Ms Fernández is on the verge of concluding an agreement with creditor governments grouped together in the Paris Club, which has around 6.7 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted that this does not imply the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
However, last month, Amado boudou, the economy minister, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the niceties of the indec.
It is not clear whether the President Fernandez is to remain in politics when his mandate, bearing in mind that no longer has to her husband at her side.
If it does, will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has tired of kirchnerismo.
When Argentines returning from their summer break in March, the wave of sympathy for she will have lapsed.
If it wants to win another election, will have to decide whether or not react, quietly, many of the policies of her husband.
Medium hurrah China
Voters in Taiwan are approaching slowly to a kind of Union closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan on its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, went on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what appears to be a comprehensive assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
The same Mr Ma has become an advocate of sentiment on the continent, innovative forging business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr Ma passed the test, but by a narrow margin.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five elections for mayor, failed to get the most votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been tipped for a full independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of all the votes compared to 45% for the KMT.
If they had been the presidential, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has fallen by almost 8%.
For the first time, the DPP empató with the KMT in Councils.
In the elections could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy trucks and large crowds with banderitas and girls clothing light dancing.
It lacked the mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot at young directly in the face, hiriéndole and killing a transeúnte.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man was inflicting harm to LIEN or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, said tsai ing-wen, the DPP leader, the fire overran the elections, growing suspicions about the DPP and scaring voters inclinasen by the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that are not addressed the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates were told of plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and loathes the military threat from China.
Consequently, the KMT usually avoid publicise their links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP avoided encourage the feeling against China.
It responds to the awareness that the Chinese trade is essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
For his part, Mr Ma said that it had confirmed that its policy with regard to China was acceptable to the majority of the Taiwanese.
It is envisaged that the Beijing Government is sobornándoles with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China lost no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on the protection of investments and the medical cooperation.
Certainly, it would also ensure the political integration, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best will be waiting for the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigaba openly independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs tsai, has emerged a new generation of moderates and the DPP is struggling to attract professionals and young people.
Ms tsai has been welcomed warmly welcome as DPP candidate for the Presidency, like his tseng-chang, which fulfilled mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that they can have relations with Beijing.
Ms tsai announced plans to create a group of experts that will act as an interface between the DPP and China, as long as they can take out the negotiations without preconditions.
Ms tsai says the Taiwanese public that his party is a "reliable alternative" to the hurried approach of Mr Ma with regard to China.
Mr Chen is outraged by the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, said that the DPP candidate would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered Mr his, a pragmatic, not the President.
Even without to Mr Chen, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between their potential candidates.
The KMT also has some soul-searching.
The assessment made by Mr Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates not to campaign with him.
His unpopularity is apparently mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT says it restructures his cabinet, as well as the local teams.
The bites of the DPP suggest that support for Taiwan to a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "has already been crossed the point of no return."
The grammy nominations: the singer of Jazz hope Spalding is the surprise winner in the category of artist revelation.
Acting at the request of a President and perhaps the people will be in it.
Hope Spalding, the downward and Jazz singer of 26 years personally selected by President Obama to act in their ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of the grammys this year with a nomination in the category of best artist revelation.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of Jazz from his album of 2008, "hope," the nomination is food for thought, but it respects the rules of the grammys that must be an artist who has not lifted the market more than three albums before recording which determines the identity "public artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber music society," certainly was an important step forward and, bearing in mind his style voice light and pleasant, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, Funk and Latino rhythms, it can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the voters of the grammys, who lately have been concentrated in the field of Jazz for this category.
In the other categories, the voters of the grammy did honor rightly 'historicity "of Vijay iyer Trio, an exciting and wonderful record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the competitors of iyer is the veteran saxofonista James Moody with "Moody 4b" and the teclista John Beasley for "positootly."
Trombone shorty, a gaudy favourite in New Orleans and invited in "treme," the HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz, that for the rest goes considerably the merger as the albums Stanley Clarke, John mclaughlin and Jeff lorber.
The savage punk of darcy James argue 's secret society got a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the great Jazz of House of Willy Childs ensemble and the always risky dave Holland, whose album live with their octeto, "pathways," was a great example of the democratic leadership of downward in his gang.

The proposed mosque in temecula gets the approval of the Commission management
The draft mosque for temecula has received the unanimous support of the local organising committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying that encourages terrorism and congestion.
However, the members of the Commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and it is impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"a lot of good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha 'I, of all religions," said Hadi nael, President of the Islamic centre of temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice will prevail."
"The opposition is is minimal," it adds.
"just talking very high."
"There are people in this valley wonderful."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who intercedía in favour or against the centre, virtually the same amount in each hand, according to the press-enterprise.
The debate on the web site of the newspaper.
"the United States no longer exist," reads one of the comments.
"This is another planet of the apes with Mrs freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans for construction of Islamic centres have prompted protests in other parts of the country, including near the ground zero, the area of New York where there were the attacks of September 11, 2011.
In the valley of temecula, the magnet Mahmoud harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been live without problems in the county of riverside, but wanted a bigger and better than the warehouse that was in a shared ownership with a manufacturer filter systems.
The new mosque in 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
The child would be taking a surface of 4,32 acres in Nicolas road, about two miles south east of the chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project in the municipal council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth or in other places...
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients holds out the prospect of finding new ways of life on earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although the researchers found the odd bacterium here on earth, say that shows that it is possible that there are ways of life without the main elements they saw as essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"This makes it into something very peculiar, although he needed to be a kind of living really 'alien'," said Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, a co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the journal Science Thursday.
For a long time, there are six large essentials in life: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in monkey lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorous by arsenic.
"You just plantearte what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to indicated Anbar, the finding is important in the search for life on other planets in the earth, given that researchers need to be able to identify the life, knowing the aspect which has.
The study focuses on a microbe found on earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which it were made public details of the discovery, led to much speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report show the discovery of life extraterrestre.
We did not.
What the discovery "shows up is that in other settings worldwide, could have bodies to use other elements to boost their biochemistry and the set of" standard "that we consider essential for life is not perhaps so flat," said Charles cockell, professor of planetary and space sciences research institute, the open university in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell not formed part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of an element for another in biochemistry and structure basic biochemistry," added cockell.
The discovery was made by chance.
Felisa wolfe-simon of the Institute of astrobiología of NASA, who led the study, focused on the monkey Lake because it contains high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar in terms of the chemical, which speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one for another.
"The arsenic is a toxic chemical mainly because their behaviour is similar to that of phosphorus."
"as a result, may find it difficult to them differentiated."
"however, arsenic is sufficiently different to that does not work as well as phosphorus, by what comes in and, as it were, apelmaza biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers also collected bacteria known as gfaj-1 and exposed the growing concentrations of arsenic, which managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that you can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that might exist naturally a way of life to use arsenic, either in other areas of the earth and another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that we can replace the arsenic for phosphorus is not new, but never found an example that should prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in earlier eras of the land, he said, by what the researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used.
"It suggests that there might be other means of generating life, not only how life formed on earth it used to," said foster, who was not part of the research team of wolfe-simon.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
They have found the dogs were stolen in compton
They have found two dogs that were missing from the four stolen the motel bellflower, according to said officers from the Sheriff of the county of Los Angeles on Thursday.
The four dogs, two akitas and two Welsh corgi pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the van Chevrolet express in 2006 in which they were spending the night, against the bellflower motel 6, pointed out the authorities.
Two of the caninos recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found Wednesday afternoon by the night, as Steve whitmore, a spokesman for the Department of the Sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," said whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to indicate exactly where they found the dog, in what district, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"It is carrying out an investigation."
"We do not want to say anything," said whitmore.
"We are following some clues."
It was found by the owners of the dogs, kristina rickard and David Peek, to make any comment on Thursday.
Met with their two akitas in a county animal shelter in downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The assistants of the Sheriff found a van and two dogs separately in compton.
According to the authorities, the akitas (outlines, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a perra 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But bunny and Peter, the corgis who rickard and Peek sought to exhibit in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of dogs, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and rickard, who lived in redding, were in the city for the national championship akc / eukanuba in long beach this weekend and had to wear to trace.
The other dogs the would appear in other events planned for the days before the championship akc / eukanuba, according to indicated Peek in the times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour for almost two months making the couple engaged in caninas competitions.
On Monday evening, Peek and rickard did the check-in at the motel.
Usually remain in moteles and park, the van just in front of the window of their room.
Took three other dogs (rearing boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But the akitas and corgis in the van because they have a coat very bulk and would be more fresh.
Left windows slightly open to dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and rickard denounced the theft of the van on Tuesday to six in the morning.
Peek has said he will deliver a reward to anyone who could that until the corgis, fitted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear if it would be a reward or not.
The lion is ready to rugir again, while the restructuring of GMMs gets the final approval of the Court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, GMMs has finally got the green light to begin again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York formally approved the plan "prearmado" by creditors to wipe out about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the entertainment of 86 years focus their efforts on the production and release of films and television programmes.
The ruling Thursday confirms that the plan meets the demands of the US bankruptcy code, so that there are no legal obstacles to GMMs revival under the founders of spyglass entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small study.
The staff is reduced to approximately 320 Members.
In fact, GMMs would not emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan chase closure a credit instrument planned 500 million dollars, to fund operations and production in the new GMMs.
The investment bank is currently sindicando credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The process of restructuring the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank moelis and Co. was contracted to give advice on the management needed to clean up their finances, as they strove to make interest payments by $300 million a year.
In the month of August, the chief executive Harry sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and an expert in recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work in krispy kreme doughnuts.
The attempts of moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial travails of GMMs and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the study, required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company on the sale.
However, the auction attracted few postores and none willing to pay more than $2 billion sought by the creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the table when the design team of GMMs began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was eventually backed by creditors at the end of October.
When GMMs officially out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies of moelis and Cooper will receive multimillion bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
The companies of Cooper, who has been garnering $375 000 per month for his services from the company, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and birnbaum plan to resume production in GMMs, which lends only one movie this year, and annual meeting a slate of seven or eight films coming out in 2012.
Also plan to co-finance two films based on "the hobbit," along with Warner bros.
The study needs to strike a separate loan of between 265 and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl icahn, who owns approximately 18% of the debt of GMMs, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with lions gate entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two airlines did not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gifts
While the iPad is the top candidate to be the most wonderful toy of the year, followed by, perhaps, the system of video games Microsoft kinect, both can mean a significant dents in their budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five bicycles bmx of 99 dollars each, and a game kinect costs the same as 10 strings of classical leap adornadas with auditors, or roughly 48 cans of play-doh.
But there are ways to keep its budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, toys "R" us and bj " s wholesale club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the law of Moore has been working; the technological toy this year is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared with last year.
In addition, while generally there are fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the best known of this kind, webkinz and club Penguin, are more offers.
And toys driven by piles of button, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(all prices are for toys "R" us, except that you indicated otherwise).
The sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) Toys soft toys the size of a cobayo chanting a note when they pull their barrigas.
Shake amounts to a note, and a second shake starts to build a song.
If you are buying more of one, they cantarán in harmony.
Caution: once it starts tightening, cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
By borrowing from the technology of elmo live last year, the muñeco animatrónico 14 inches plays games in exchange for turn as simóm says, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with blocking device.
The children who tested the toy used to Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of a control volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, may remind alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (hasbro / playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a rucksack full of letters of questions designed to make a trip by car in a session with a set of exercises ocurrente self-correction.
If you are unfriendly to give their child the smart phone, here econtrará three independent alternatives.
Mobigo of vtech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheaper and easier to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the Games do not teach with such efficiency as the leapster explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), is the first to point the leapster line, with a screen more new and brilliant.
Neither version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Ixl of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the kind iTunes for table games and e-books, and has a ranura for sd cards that can display photos of family.
Finally, scrabble flash ($30, hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks barely bigger than a box of cerillas, each with its own screen LEDs.
The aim is to build words placing blocks lined before the end of time; it is a formidable competition for an impromptu of armed words.
They are increasingly toys that have some sort of connection in line.
Based only on its presence in jugueterías, the two largest are webkinz and club Penguin.
In order to buy his son a pet in line in the club Penguin, for example, can achieve a Disney club Penguin 2 'mix' n match features Pack, ($5, $6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you canjea the code online, your son gets enough credit in the shop of club Penguin to two articles.
These could include roller on wheels or a pet toy puffle.
Slightly larger than the cerda of his brush teeth, hexbug nano ($10, for five years and more) is the latest in a line of microrobots driven by piles of button.
The false insect moves quickly about 12 feet of silicone that vibran, in random directions.
It is fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the table in the kitchen and even a bit inside of the mouth of our dog.
It promotes a more moderate side of the maintenance of order in China
As an instructor sergeant urban Tang, shenbin marked the step in a square in the city, inspecting severely the nerve dependants, issuing orders in voice low military authority.
He wanted the female Members of the chengguan, corpulentos policemen in urban China, feared and despised by their crackdown capricious and their inclination to violence, they communicate an impression with a handful of spectators.
'! "
"attention!"
You muéstrenles, he whispered, "How are the girls fine!"
Four girls who barely passed the teens with white collar and identical olive Green jackets and trousers tight to draw attention.
Four pairs of shoes were perfectly aligned.
Four hats elegant fitted perfectly above the hair tied up with moños rays in blue and white.
"personally, I think we have a seemingly normal," said Mr Tang, desdeñosamente.
"The models are lindos."
More than a government has tried to clean up the image of the inspectors urban China.
A city ordered that all the new recruits have a title of degree.
Guangdong province changed the colour of the appalling Green uniform blue to a supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by scare gaze: in 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward carrito of snacks, and I noted with the few eyebrows were raised steadily for half an hour, until the took their things and got away.
Xindu, an urban district of 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen for its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give to the dubious police a softer side, feminine.
Unfortunately, until scarlett johansson would be to increase the infinitesimal respect for China to these squads of the city.
And for good reason, Welby critics.
Unlike the police, the officers are allowed only to enforce the city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely map a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of Hubei province killed blows at a transeúnte after having used his cell phone for filmarlos while disolvían a protest against a landfill site.
Last year, a handbook of training for inspectors in Beijing was Hurtado and published on the Internet, which he described as a scourge effectively to criminals, without making them bleed.
This year, a travelling salesman sandías of Shanghai suffered brain damage after a row with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street sellers.
"chengguan has left a scar on the government," deplores China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the district request through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing evening news wondered if women had real homework or were simply a distraction escénica.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The notice of district called candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and the five facial features armoniosos."
Having a height above the average, more than 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at the age of 26 years is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"his image is the important thing," said one anonymous official from district to rednet.com, a website almost.
"first, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they comply with the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The chengguan are as floreros female, he said, adding, "in addition to being floreros, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng lihua, deputy director of the office of administration in the district, is not anxious to support this description.
But noted that the demands were high standards in many reminders of Chinese work for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for armoniosos facial features.
If this means be bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the handicapped or disfigured must not stand.
"We cannot allow a person to take or a jorobado come to work here," said Mr Zheng.
"his image it would be wrong."
Liu Yi, who patrol the baoguang square near a monastery, has 22 years, with their cheeks and a mouth just subtly curve.
She does not believe that the emphasis in your appearance is sexist, said.
"Do you think it is sexy with this?" he asked with a look sardónica.
His colleague with hoyuelos, Xu Yang, 21, said "our work must submit the image of the city."
They do not oppose its work at the time, they said, because entertained ambitions to race higher than simply scare sellers in the alleys where it was supposed to stop his business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less to a dozen hawkers who are on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell so many last or ceramic bowls tofú as possible before they are now.
"Mr Wang, must leave."
"I have said many times!" said Miss Xu while a seller escaped on foot, temporarily leaving his chariot pulled by bicycle with guarniciones of fideos.
Officials described his duties as more monotonous that exhausting.
"This is more or less the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who is investigating marketing in their hours free.
"very routine."
One reason is that the female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of sellers.
Only can threaten to denounce offenders to their supervisors men.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstration of the tape, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of people in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, amotinaron then that is esparciera the false rumor that chengguan officers had been killed a seller.
More than a dozen policemen or chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 vehicles poured into the government or prendidos fire.
By the time xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is just guaranteed.
Only two streets of the placid baoguang square, where the female officers patrullaron this morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had seized a motorcycle that was being rectified in the sidewalk instead of in a garage, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the bike gritaba grossly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the official, with bad side, opening up on the way to their cars and were quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator allocated to male squadron, remained behind, with its white flag given back to conceal his name.
As the female officers, the coordinators, men aged 40 years or more, play a purely of support.
Unlike them, are not taught to maintain an image elegant.
"Sometimes we verbally."
"Sometimes we struggled physically," said Mr Li with total.
"most of the time it is the public which starts the fight."
Prosecutors kept no charges against the senator Ensign
The lawyers of Senator announced on Wednesday that prosecutors from the Department of Justice have exculpado Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and its efforts to ensure work through lobby to the husband of the woman.
The decision ends the legal threat more serious facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was regarded as a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, so that the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and bruised his career.
The office of Ensign said she was "certainly pleased" by the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of its research and has no plan to lift charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, which said that seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have confabulado for violating a ban on lobbying Federal Criminal.
The interviews, e-mail and other documents that were made public in the first place in October 2009 in the New York Times noted that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby to ensure the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the affair of the senator with her.
Ms Hampton once worked as treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign was in contact with several sponsors politicians to find work to Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Like Hampton had recently been a qualified Ensign, was excluded according to the law to lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were friends before the intimate affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving Dorr lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict that former state employees to use their connections for personal business.
The evidence that has been made public, "appeared to be a prima facie case of conspiracy to violate the Statute substantially revolving Dorr," said Stanley Brandt, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients being investigated by the government.
While officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr Brandt and other lawyers of ethics said the department seemed wary about accepting political prosecutions after several setbacks in its public integrity section, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are "clearly a cowards," said Melanie sloan, executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a group that brought a number of complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the law does not apply to them," he added.
Paul coggins, the chief lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor for the justice department on Monday and another more calls the next day, saying that the department did not want to lift charges against his client.
The defence team of Ensign had been cooperating with prosecutors in the attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments that he gave prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we took the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation in a separate complaint by the Group on ethics, which argues that a payment of $96,000 to the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral Commission said that she did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was not more than a gift.
NV energy is a major company of Nevada, who had supported for a long time senator, which managed to work through lobby, thanks to the help that Ensign given Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company agreed to Hampton as industry lobbyist, the chief of staff, John Lopez, Ensign was with Hampton and told that he was "pound" the Interior Ministry on a point of contention.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, and allegiant air, called the Secretary of transportation to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When we first saw the news of the affair last year, Ensign asked forgiveness from his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth leading Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists who planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When the speaker of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, Ensign announced that it was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, said that the senator had expected that the ethics committee followed the example of the Department of Justice and finish his research.
"Senator Ensign wishes to continue with this difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire aimed at Twitter
There were half a dozen of them, "chateando" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, sent reports of shocking testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defence, had more than 140,000 messages on Twitter on the process that went into the breach and children tied to their beds in a House which was once kindled fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to come to an end, with the imposition of the judge of the death sentence passed by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr Hayes have written in court that they delineate them the arguments of appeals that probably will take to the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intensive reports on the process, including the wide use of Twitter by journalists of mass media, created "a circus atmosphere," and such a glut and with details exaltadores made public passions ejercieran an inappropriate influence over the jury.
The call might force the appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"according to what I experienced during this process, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to get a fair hearing," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief counsel for the defence of Mr Hayes.
The judge of first instance Jon C. blue, the State Supreme Court, rejected lacónicamente claims in a ruling last week, saying that news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury has been driven by passion.
But probably will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have acknowledged that the coverage of cases celebres may lead to questions about the fairness of the process.
In a landmark ruling in 1966, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a osteopaths of Cleveland, Dr Sam sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television show and the movie "the fugitive."
Some lawyers said the courts of appeals that examined the condemnation of Mr Hayes half a century later, could be intrigued by the argument that could be needed new rules to control the form of communication from the halls of the Court, something inimaginadable in the case of Dr. sheppard.
"There is a reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in processes of high profile, said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report which said it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor donohue said that some judges of appeal could be intrigued by the idea that limit the immediate communication from the halls of the Court could make that trials were fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the issues outlined by lawyers from Hayes, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying the execution.
The defence lawyers also say, for example, that Hayes could have been undermined when the judge blue refusal to allow testearan reactions of potential juries by showing gruesome photos of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that they were shocked by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their daughters, hayley, 17, and michaela of 11.
The defence lawyers say that also take the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removió to a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that incorrectly had lobbied for a verdict by the bizarre decision to it be possible to tell the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The panels were not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract the most interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly meant grist to the mills of the excitement about the case.
"The crowding of tweets from the media, the cameras and reporters outside the court," wrote the attorneys, "was something not seen here in new haven and perhaps throughout the state."
His attention in the coverage of tweeter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news were more important than the reports delivered more slowly, were a ludita vision that would make the politics of the Court on the control of the coverage was weak in future.
But some lawyers said the courts of appeal often were swayed by the arguments on the adjustment required in the courts because of technological and social changes.
The lawyers of Hayes are pushing for this call.
In his letter, mentioned the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, repealing the condemnation of Dr. sheppard due to coverage of the process, and made it clear that would require new media would require new rules.
"this case," wrote, "represents the case sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can the civility bridge to link the divisions?
After a campaign marked by the tirade and the negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation future or a delusional before a rapid return to the fray party in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on major issues that must be handled during the lame-duck session.
But according to everyone, was at least a polite discussion of the difference of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, instead of being another episode vacuum for partisan gain.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Commission 's deficit President was equally civilized, despite political differences that exist between Members.
It seems clear that the close interaction during a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates the Members.
That is hardly enough to declare that it has reached a new era of cooperation.
Now both sides are in a trial period, sondeándose each other to identify signs of cooperativismo and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and patience from voters to a renewed war.
Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of the same by the participants took control with a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and they are very deeply ingrained as to suggest any rapid change of climate that existed during the past two years.
Whether it is tax, spending, health care or social support, the two parties are poles apart.
Anyway, the election of November has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in relation to the way of saying things," said pete wehner, a Bush administration official now at the center for ethics and public policy.
"are inevitable after the election.
The elections give partisan passions, which are dying out.
That is a good thing ."
On some issues, particularly those mentioned in the order of the day of the lame-duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, it is likely to be a commitment to extend the unemployment, probably because the Republicans can not believe that they are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich, denied unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the lame-duck session, along with the ratification of the new deal on nuclear disarmament start (strategic arms reduction treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, notes that the successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the lame-duck session does not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartisanship when the new 112do. Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, it is highly likely and inevitable, begins a period of disagreement.
"after that things that are due to be carried out, in the short term, psychology reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the citizen can lead to a real partnership.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the Constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who were instrumental in its creation.
For more awareness with Republican leaders about the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill his promises to cut the cost of the state and the new law.
These partisan lines are already clearly in initial reactions against the recommendations of the Committee on the deficit, including the reform of the tax code and increasing some taxes and retirement age, and the retrenchment.
The Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to its own valuation, have introduced to force the issue of the deficit in the order of the day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee on 18 Members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been fighting to get close to that figure.
The strongest resistance is between the elected officials in the panel, suggesting that in tax-related issues, at least today, few bases or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between Republicans in the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of clashes supporters, when the Republican challenge to Obama over the budget, taxes and health care, followed then by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a standstill, as happened in 1995, then both parties will be watching the reaction of the people.
Anyone who feel that it is losing probably will change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and the polarisation are now higher than they were in the 1990s, and seems to have a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress who had between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the prelude to a more momentous in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo showing this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find commonalities in the issues that still divide them.
A US document leaked portrays to Moscow as paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and leaves a part of the bribes and money that collects directly to the Kremlin, as reported in February, the US Embassy in Russia.
It reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service manage huge systems of blackmail, which helps to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also of organised crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed the "top-down authority," takes his hand as the money to get on the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in its Web site Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while he was still mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow, and blame him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean sweep since then.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several demands for libel over the accusations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel asked about a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, said: "This is madness, a canard, a nuisance."
According to surveys, the Russians believe overwhelmingly that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explicados closely, as they were in the report of the embassy, and it is extraordinary that the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links to the government of the city of Moscow with crime, have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to say that the government operates more like a kleptocracy that as a government," says the note.
"The criminal elements have 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and of the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) which transcends the police, the Federal Security Service (sfs), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the office of the prosecutor, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"analysts identified a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The sfs, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is a system ineffective in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide certain services."
The report says that the sfs collects the money from the larger companies, and that the police showed small shops.
A source, said the report, "explained that the Moscow business owners understand that the best is to ensure the protection of the MVD and sfs (instead of the groups organised crime) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power that criminal groups, but are also protected by the law."
"for this reason, the protection against criminal gangs is no more a priority."
The document notes that, while the tax money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay are quickly closed their businesses as a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has achieved little progress.
The note to the embassy report men taking, probably suitcases full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy satarov, director of the group of experts from indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"but he is a part of this tape."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, indem estimates that corruption costs to Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified at 154 (the countries are classified in the least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the document of the American embassy, which did not occur until late at night in Moscow, surely will cause anger within the Russian Government, and despite that Luzhkov can be blamed for the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity to claim that the Kremlin is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN for Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents WikiLeaks might be lies and reacted furiosamente by revealing that said that American diplomats called Batman and Robin to Medvedev.
"The truth of the matter is that this concerns our interaction, which is an important factor in the domestic policies in this country," she said.
"But to be honest with you, not we suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, that was done in a manner so immoral."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a particular classroom weakly lighted, with stained walls and descascaradas, the director of the school anlong veng recalled the man who had constructed, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"everyone here love Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and was preoccupied by his people," said sreng KOR Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" by its brutality during the Khmer Rouge commander, remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia, where built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where still live thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge is account with the government, the loyalty continued for a long time is being finally challenged in anlong veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and reconciliation allowed victims who were publicly to people who had taken part in the scheme.
In June, the government distributed a textbook of secondary school for the first time taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each one of these events, the anxiety has grown among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in anlong veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and his attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they cannot do anything," said youk chhang, director of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"for them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within the families."
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of starvation, disease or overworking, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979, the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border from Cambodia with Thailand.
There launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movement which surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary received guerrilla warfare from bases in the mountains and forests in Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in anlong veng.
But in the 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN to the first democratic elections in the country in 1993, large groups of combatants of the Khmer Rouge began to desert towards the government, culminating in the rendiciones of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea; Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the dangrek mountains nearby.
Died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest combatants of the Khmer Rouge fell in absolute poverty which is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge continued with their local administrative posts in exchange for abandoning their weapons, the soldiers rasos remain poor and not qualified.
"These people have received few benefits then accountability," said Sok leang of the Center for justice and reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, even in anlong veng.
"They have built into the ideology of agrarian utopian regime."
"They were bred without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge when I was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near anlong veng before engaging to life as a farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"life with the Khmer Rouge was good," she said.
"Ta Mok gave him to eat at all."
"But now the life is difficult because we have to autoabastecernos."
The current court of the Khmer Rouge has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, it is expected that the Court begins to prosecute Nuon Chea; Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the Court is to prosecute the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but has not said whether it will cases of these four.
This is not done much to calm fears in anlong veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on im chaem, aged 64, who was a district chief in the province of banteay meanchey during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators the documentation centre of Cambodia, which had overseen the construction of the dam of trapeang thma, a project which thinks that have killed thousands of slave labour.
During a recent scandalous later, IM chaem came back from work in the camps to their home on pilotes of wood in a path of land on the outskirts of anlong veng.
When the sun fired long shadows on the parched grass, IM chaem refusal to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court convened would not.
"Cambodia is peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who desertó of the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability if the Court does more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," she said.
But the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to advance, said youk chhang, the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to connect the pieces broken," she said.
"It is our duty to bring these pieces broken so that we can understand."
The center was the first book of text approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, called "history of Democratic Kampuchea," 75 pages.
It was distributed in anlong veng in June as an addition to book history of school of Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of anlong veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the link of the city with the regime.
Touch valeak, 19, a student at the school in anlong veng, said that the new textbook helped the students to understand a significant part of their history.
But their parents reacted with skepticism when brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book of text and the Court," she said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people who processed by the Court."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation is complex and difficult, said Sok leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the Court are beginning to make an impact, she said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the dangrek mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered in plastic bags offal leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin ceiling.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, 31, a seller of mobile phones to the edge of the road, said that he did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"but he has a strong spirit and many people in the place to go rezarle," she said.
It was the birthday of nuom sothea, and later that day decided to walk up to the last rest of Pol Pot, which would leave a whole bunch of bananas mature hoping for good luck.
Belarus is giving up its stockpile of uranium qualified for armaments
In a stunning victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect the nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that will surrender its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit of security.
For years, the US Government had been trying to persuade Belarus that renounced its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But American officials said the Washington Post did a couple of classified operations with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranium for weapons as an installation of Belarusian investigations.
This paved the way for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the issue.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the Summit of nuclear safety in 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was a good achievement securing the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the summit of nuclear safety in 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken luongo, President of the society for global security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very important step and significant" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide within the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped to six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit of nuclear safety of Obama, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, stated that the country never will not give up its uranium.
"We have maintained the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what basically is qualified to uranium weapons) and the low-enriched uranium," said Lukashenko in that time.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not giving them to anyone."
"use it for research purposes, is everything."
However, Belarus moved to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of removing uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly difficult, because the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said that was loaded on a train travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility to storage and disposal.
According to the officials, the second operation was completed on Monday and was made by plane.
The US government spent 13 billion dollars for the tasks, and most of the money is used to feed to Belarus the installation of investigations with uranium enrichment, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew bieniawski, an official of the Department of energy, which operates in the reduction of global threat, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with very careful to build confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will eliminate its stockpile by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the repression gritty of Lukashenko of human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential thaw.
It said that "while it welcomes the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognised that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government not lodged objections to the CIA flights
The Spanish Government not lodged objections to the CIA flights with prisoners Taliban and al-Qaeda with the direction of Guantánamo by Spanish territory, according to said in a telegram to the US ambassador in Madrid.
So they reflect the documents leaked (cables) by WikiLeaks in the newspaper the country, where the then senior vice-chairman of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, demanded that the Spanish executive was reported to "be able to show that exercising appropriate monitoring on foreign aircraft that are in Spain."
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice-President admitted that the report of the Council "had picked up the Zapatero government outside game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"from the Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid becoming "burnt unprepared," Aguirre described in a cable.
The then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this issue the profile low as possible, although, to be in the hands of judges, the government had a limited ability to influence."
For its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez conveyed to the embassy that she would not seek to block the initiative of the judge of asking for the declassification of documents from the national intelligence centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"these reports do not contain any incriminatorio nor any sensitive information," said the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected his concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors Germans," rather than by the information desclasificada the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between governments," laments Aguirre.
In March 2007 in a lunch meeting between the Ambassador of the US and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are rabiosamente jealous of their independence and will do what they themselves consider appropriate," he had instructed his employees to avoid comments of inflamada rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature ."
The Ambassador also expresses its concern about action by the PP in this matter.
"despite its general orientation pro-American, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be construed as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," says.

The popular gained four seats in Congress and the PSC will lose 9
With the results of the 28-n, the PP could be decisive in the towns of Lérida in Catalonia, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase of votes and Members experienced in recent regional elections, the Catalan party already has the generals because, having earlier or not, the outlook is more than good, as the number of votes that this training gets in these elections is usually double that receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalans scored 610.473 votes in the general of 2008, while in Spain in 2006, the figure had reached 316.222.
Last Sunday, the CFP has 384.091 votes.
Keeping this upward trend, which has worked on a volume of votes of the PSC and the fidelización the electorate of the PP, this training analysts have calculated that, if held general elections, the PPP could move from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while ciu would also four (now has 10) and the PSC will lose nothing less than 9 members (has 25).
These calculations constatarían square that Catalan is crucial to PP and the PSOE.
According to the analysis of the PPE, ERC will lose a Member - now has three - while icv would get a Member or would one.
But, to keep the electoral timetable, the most immediate meeting will take place in May of 2011 with the municipal elections, where the public can also be decisive in order for the Socialist leadership in the four provincial capitals and in his baton at the forefront of the regional government of Barcelona, one of the administrations most budget is running - 661 million euros by 2011.
Both nationalist and public agrees the possibility that the PSC loses Councils in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida in Catalonia and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain a majority not to resort to its traditional partners, ERC and icv.
Given the Republican debacle, that this training lose their representation in the consistorio barcelonés - it needs the 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four cities and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida in Catalonia and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced power dominate the turnabout in the capital tarraconense, where ruled with the PP rather than the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros.
Of Lérida in Catalonia, the PP has emerged only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, met on several occasions.
The people have grown up in another important as badalona, castelldefels or reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 local governments in Catalonia and is seeking to form lists in the highest number of people.
The Catalan cell gave thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, in Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistani Nigerian and arrested by officers from the police station of information from the police in Barcelona as a jihadist cell, which run from Thailand, it provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and" Laskar E taiba (let), author this last of the attacks in Mumbai which killed to 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has attached great importance to this research, to the point of ensuring that the "operation kampai" has been "weakened" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and, therefore, its operational capacity ."
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that include criminal galaxy Al Qaeda for its "combatants" cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the only that the jihadist network was operational in Europe, we have been involved in the research, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so that cannot be ruled out in the territory of the EU is carried out in the next few days similar coups to develop on the evening of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (were arrested Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan Begum, tanveer arshad and the Nigerian babatunde agunbiade), in Thailand was another with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt and the sirikanlaya Thai kijbumrung.
These were the ones that ran from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was battered in 2009 - robaba mainly to tourists passports that comply with the requirements set by the so-called "world Islamic front."
That is, the documents should be on behalf of males aged between 25 and 45 years old with valid for several years and without visas estampadas.
In media research stresses that, for now, has not been found no evidence that links the arrested in Catalonia in the attack on Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and taiba," has been one of the groups recipients of stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth remembering that days before was perpetrated this attack from Catalonia were sent through a transfer Agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the "command" that took the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires more than the tax concert aparque
The leader of the PPP, Alice sánchez-camacho - was yesterday to give you personally to Artur Mas their conditions to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat, identical to the questions during the campaign and summarised in giving priority to the recovery of the economy in filo-soberanistas adventures, as is the economic harmony, the nationalist leader wants to uphold in the mid-point of its mandate.
The President of the Catalan people came to the meeting of Artur Mas with security which have gained 18 members in last Sunday " s elections, a figure that is more than enough to get to, as the candidate of ciu needs that at least one of the holding the opposition should abstain at the investiture vote.
A possible Entente with the PP depend the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but, for now, the conversations these days keeps fashion with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalan.
And as far as the President of the PP, to support an appointment "to park all the speeches pro-sovereignty group and reaching," as well as the economic harmony - similar to the Basque country - which the convergent leader to even put to referendum.
The two leaders do have in common their bid to slim down the political apparatus of a regional administration very inflated and the elimination of the inheritance tax and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the appointment of Mas will, by the CFP, Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat.
Mas has met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which promised a fierce opposition, Joan Herrera (icv) and today will with Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan laporta (solidaritat Catalan).
The geriatric care claims that the deaths were not for "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of olot does not preclude his prison guard killing more than 11 elderly
The attitude of the geriatric care caritat of olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference to highlight the damage it has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila dilmé, the nurse that while I was there employee killed at least 11 people at his office.
The Director of the residence, Joan hall, appeared with the counsel of the centre, the lawyer Joan Glen, and announced that "the desire of the caritat would be able to exercise the accusation against the head" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibilities oblige us to take on the situation of responsible civilians."
And it is also of the social harms that could suffer the entity by not having detected in time the criminal activities of existence, the major threat to the caritat now charges form of substantial compensation already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and since then has continually kill.
The judge said in the car and ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric care - who thought that in many cases no doctor exploraba personally to the dead but, because of the age and pathology of patients, it despachaba the handling by telephone.
The caritat, through his manager, yesterday flatly denied this and said that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of the caritat added that "in the case did not have a single indication that there was a reckless action by any other person that is not the defendant."
The already termed "Angel of death" confessed to the 11 murders and detailed the first crime they committed on 29 August 2009 for a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case led to the death pinchándole an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he made with a mixture of pills sedatives.
The Director of the caritat notes that it is difficult to ensure that the staff at the centre have access to medicines.
The sensations of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in their zeal to alleviate the suffering of the inmates used to give them death.
But the analysis that are being done in the lab, which will have to clarify whether Vila not lies and sought to its first victims a death less cruel or if, on the contrary, the abrasó inside them bleach as has confessed he did with the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In the caritat not give credibility to the demonstrations of existence, nor even the number of avowed murders, which does not preclude that higher, and justify their attitude in the different versions that has given Vila on their visits to the Court and in the sense that it must change its way of having been, with success, eight murders.
That is why I say that to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat yesterday Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability of reaction."
The spreads on peripheral closed with strength and shares of European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ability of the ECB failure and the euro has both begun picking up which is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday in a market ilíquido like collapses recovers but motivated by closure of short and very speculative.
The institutional investor wants to lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB we cited today to withdraw liquidity measures and will retractar tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the left.
The Bundesbank demanded complete the plan of buying of government debt by ineffective and removing all the extraordinary measures of liquidity to run and leaving only unrestricted access to week.
After the Irish crisis we hope to extend the current liquidity "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unrestricted access to the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We expect to continue with its programme of purchases of bonds and even to give the signal to reinforce it.
If they fail to comply with the expectations generated isn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if remain obstinate in withdrawing measures of liquidity, God help us!
Like at its meeting in May in which they said they had not seen the buying of bonds and markets collapsed, tomorrow it could be repeated history.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazuca Monday and Wednesday said they had already bought much, causing a market crash.
Yesterday the auctioning of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million per 5,28%, versus 750 million per 4,81% from the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a shift in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has published the figures of the hole from allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures are estimates 10 million in the short term and other potential 15,000 and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are acceptable within the plan of assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to win parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have sufficient support, so that Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has mitigated the tone of the speech to ease tension with a view to the forthcoming summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which there is a need for a political compromise to the effect that we are a Union, and that all touching the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play to Wagner and the rest the Ode to Joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the gift of the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment ringing in the ears of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and zp explains that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, twice the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the response of the government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise result.
There are now a key auction of a bond in three years that will benefit from the effect Trichet for what we hope will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain to ask an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
We will give the liquidity line that we do not need the Treasury have more than $40 billion in liquidity available the triple in March, exorbitantly expensive types and closed access to markets sine díe.
However, the strategy must remain of Caesar " s wife, "in addition, s independence."
Mind, we can.
The President of eulen impugnará board of Vega Sicily requested by their children.
The storm abates not in open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of eulen and enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, impugnará, considering it full of "zero," the Board of the enebro next day 16 requested by five of his seven children and that they will try to assert their majority and be done with the management bodies of signing holder of wineries Vega Sicily.
David Alvarez and his son Jesus David and María José are they legal battery for the new chapter in their legal dispute over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem prepared to compromise on their dispute to be present in the governing bodies of the enebro.
His board was descabalgado by five of his seven children that there is talk too of administrators in the House of shareholders of 18 January this year and whose dispute is annotated in the commercial register.
The Board of the enebro for the next day on 16, convened by the magistrate of the commercial number 2 of Madrid, has opened a box of the truenos within the family Alvarez.
The appeal judge to fix the House is to resolving the conflict, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the call for the junta.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of applicants for their five children, through procedural contrivance, in clear fraud law and abuse of the right, try converting and make the board radically zero on 18 January," according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis on which, once held the junta, proceed with its challenge to think "zero is full."
The same players, maintained a discreet silence, already tried without success to the magistrate convened in June a college.
In the enebro, society and equity holder of wineries Vega Sicily, among other assets, the seven children of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of public services, however, the harvest on 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the basic question must decide the judge once the view on the demand of dispute, for which there is no such target date.
Network bull succeeds in Formula 1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software engineers improvements in cars in real time.
Since network bull burst into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and with success.
In a prime time nobody took into consideration the options of a escudería new arrival and, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, last November, in the final straight championship all gambled by the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the skill as pilot of the eventual champion, German Sebastian vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine to drive his car in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of network bull into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful software simulation of processes that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the car racing.
So-called plm, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design line of manufacturing plants throughout the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulating the product or process before building it so real, avoiding the gaps and unnecessary expenditure.
Plm facilitated the development of the cameras, the Sukhoi planes or cars more famous slew of Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this instrument in its computer factory Formula 1 has allowed network bull design and lead to "in a few hours, almost in real time," modifications, changes and improvements that are for the careers and in testing.
Russwurm explains that the escuderías in 1992 had an average of 10 points in his team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
In the team of network bull at work 180 young professionals of highly qualified, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and cast all kinds of changes in the bólidos.
The manager explained that the Siemens plm software is capable of analysing and improve all the elements of the bólidos network bull except the engine, which is full responsibility for Renault.
Amending the materials, the fuel, the aircrafts and elements of security.
The changes can be implemented in the virtual reality of the simulador to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production using lasers and autoclaves of high technology.
As only limitation of this lunacy of technological upgrading is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formula 1 can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Network bull has mounted the factory of high technology to design and produce their bólidos in a village some 50 miles from London.
These two buildings in which are restricted visits, especially for journalists.
All events there is considered "top secret."
The template for this task at 580 people, including their two pilots, the champion vettel and mark webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 grid bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian vetell.
Between the huge technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has put at the service of their participation in the channels, are hiding other actors whose competition is invaluable and zero visibility.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve nevey, says that five years ago you could say that the progress of R [amp] D in cars of carts gave the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology amount 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15% of the value added.
Nevey recognizes that vettel and webber will never be replaced by the technology because "gladiators" are unpredictable.
Hp by fitting in two years 20 shops own with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (hp) opened its first store in Barcelona yesterday exclusively in collaboration are his partner Pont kings.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 metres squared the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company compatibilizará this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multimarca as PC city, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of hp Spain, Helena Herrero, set the example the recast shop located in the great way barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, who works for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to locate 200 points of sale of brand in Europe by 2013, a strategy which includes the 20 establishments Spaniards.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona.
Blacksmith declined to divulge the following possible openings, although he admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
Also the director of hp personal systems that philosophy to install the shops will always be the same, buoyed by a local dealer with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The group advises American and ensures the exclusive furniture design shop (with products that they can play interactively so), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, hp covers the training of the shops.
Helena Herrero denied that it was part of a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops to "improve customer service and to SMEs in the purchase, the attention, after sales and even the packaging."
The shop of Barcelona includes a room with a pioneering pilot program at global level that operates to resolve potential problems of computer equipment from hp in guarantees.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"this system is designed especially for SMEs, users, as large companies already have employed technical assistance services," stressed yesterday that Herrero.
Sabadell bet for 'stealing' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, the assistant deputy bank sabadell, Jaime guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the seat, but initially ruled out a new liquidity crisis and is predicting the end of the war of the liabilities.
Despite this, provides for a collapse in interest, which is trying to offset in part by increases in committees and in the price of credit.
Sabadell expected win in three years a million individual customers, its unresolved.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and to survive in an economic environment very complicated.
The Bank to be launched in 2011 a new plan director who will have a minimum of three years.
The objective, in addition to survive without the need to resort to public support of frob, is winning market share with the recruitment of a million new individual customers -700.000 if you descuentan which can leave - his main preoccupation, which until now had lovingly nurtured more to small businesses and the retail customer.
This year has got 250,000 individual customers and 50 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, whereas in companies exceeds 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is a gamble for productivity, or austerity, with cost reduction target, and whose challenges the set out the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to set itself objectives and least since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the banking world.
Sabadell, indeed, will close this year its plan director optima set four years ago, although I was initially for three, but the situation of the markets made to widen a year.
Customers that allow banks and building societies will be his main target.
At a breakfast organized by the apie, guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult year and wide-ranging."
The executive, indeed, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "sluggish."
In addition, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create jobs," something crucial to the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the liabilities - which criminalises the márgenes- is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and building for their emissions to obtain liquidity are shifting as the price of credit to offset the drop in margins.
"the issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the loan."
"We have not dried up, but the spreads are higher," guardiola admitted.
BANESTO already given Thursday ordering their network to limiting the credit in the long term and will take the price of the -ver spreads cincodías 22 and 27 November.
Also recognized that the conduct of the banking now "is getting committees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The plan director of sabadell is based on the organic growth, although, as always, the group does not preclude corporate operations.
Indeed, ensures that in Spain "will require larger sizes."
"next year is going to move everything," he assured.
Claims that the capital needs are "very well" and did not rule out that some Spanish financial company into the red.
And notes that the frob can close to the market in the uptake of funds to new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, shrugged off what some bankers predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
That cannot be broadcast, but contrary to what happened in June, it can obtain financing in the short term through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and once again insist on the speed with which it is implementing the restructuring of the sector.
When pulled the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, were several lenders were assured they would not participate in this first phase and would reserve for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Confederation of Spanish savings banks (ECSC), José Antonio olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to happen.
"I think the bigger share of mergers has been done, the incorporation of cajasol to a group of civic banking cannot be said to be a second round, there are adjustments."
"the biggest part is completely made; maybe instead of 17 go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have been done and tutelados by the Bank of Spain, that this has worked very well," said the manager.
In statements at a breakfast meeting of the Association of directors and executives of Aragón (adea) olavarrieta, has shown that the concentration process is addressing "the greatest speed possible, and we must be very happy as is happening at the time that in its day, not now, have been set in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain" emphasized.
"going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no equal in history, reducing the number of entities with a 62% to be much more big to meet with Basel," stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of views rather unfortunate on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate a "lack of seriousness and respect," because "what makes the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta, assures yesterday that Spain has the financial system more rigorous across Europe and "probably" in the world, and attached to those who challenge a "lack of knowledge."
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic climate, "we can be very calm" with the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks, a system that has launched a process of concentration "very important" and that "is the greatest speed possible."
Also recalled that Spanish banks it was very successful staging of the stress tests that the ECB took in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced further adjustment measures, from tax cuts to SMEs, regulation of private agencies placement or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed with no benefit to the privatisation of the 49% of aena, the management of airports of horses and the Prat and 30% of the state lotteries.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Felipe González, has joined the criticism of the cancillera Angela Merkel for their role in triggering the current crisis.
How shall we interpret these moves?
Go ahead that Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And that Germany has a new vision of what should be their future, which is at odds with that of maintaining the traditions of good part of their partners.
Compared to the European resistance, in Germany begins to especularse on three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, comprised of herself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the South would leave the currency area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems to science fiction, with a current of opinion favorable, very close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals more macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries violators, possible defaults of any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the prospective adjustments.
The German position is clear and defining comes from long ago, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission estimulaban deficits, the German Government came up with a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed it should be (plans for fiscal rigour and stability in public financing), and what they were practicing their European partners, including France.
The second in the front is that given the Central European country when Merkel won took the decision to rescue of Greece.
By then, was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and the public and the published were perfectly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has been a clear stance, calling for the reform of the Treaties of the Union to the rescue of a country and, at the same time, forcing private lenders to pay part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, which precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat watered down, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should assist the process of reform of the Union makes those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that not cross.
And telling us all that, though it now has to take measures that perhaps is not far from agreement, from the time the former operation of the euro, it will be finished.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries offenders will be severely punished, may be forced to go on suspension of payment and, in this case, the private sector, it will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must keep a harsh way of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in alcohol consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and the building, with huge holes in the balance of payments, as the who chaired the Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate.
The signal is clear.
And it would be wrong not to understand.
These are not just dealing with the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we require is much harder.
And the worst thing in these circumstances we could do is let to ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence should switch to a calmer.
And to use the window of opportunity that we have given, until spring 2013.
It seems that the President Zapatero also has understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after the meeting on Saturday with big business and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, has opened up the view that we have to order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn here and it seems that will move.
And, among the possibilities are there, to leave a monetary zone too atiborrada of countries that are not serious, it cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany can we always say that he had alerted.
Sport and fraud law.
Wiles as Alonso and Ramos to Ajax show ingenuity but unwilling to escape a fine.
The expulsion allegedly carefully nurtured by two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party contested on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to write about if such behaviour is unsporting and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes in the game (that his team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time out means to make mistakes that the referee would prove the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will as leader of his group, both players will be exactly the sanction by the next game of the liguilla, against auxerre, and they can advance clean of cards to the next stage.
Finally, the Committee of discipline of UEFA has given two games by coach Jose mourinho, and with varying amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but more frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that form part of the ethos of the unwritten rules, but, in this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case mentioned it has been involved a team of the excellence of real Madrid (who in his anthem prides itself of nobility and honor, and that in the past has fined for their players for similar acts) and dramatizing orchestrated, apparently, by mourinho, who adds one more episode to its long history of technical sweeping and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of behaviour does not expressly prohibited by the regulation goes against the principles of sport, that is, if with these actions committed fraud law; for, indeed, are actions - sporting regulation, but seem to avoid.
The issue is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that comprises the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the players, as with these actions are not endangered, that is to say, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that are continuing the play is to prevent the team from the players offenders is profiting unfairly the opposing team, happened.
However, the paradox of the action of the players from Real Madrid is not acomodó what normally we characterize as trap or fraud law, since its infringement of the rules are not made on to try to avoid punishment, but that his action was to be the most obvious is to receive the punishment of the referee.
They happily and accepted the punishment.
Another question is what kind of advantage gets offenders in the intentional examined.
Here it must be pointed out that it is in terms of the rival or benefiting from the same party, obviously, the result of the action it is to leave the home team with fewer players.
And it is also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club could not count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards could threaten his participation in a future party.
But it is an advantage in the long term, with a certain degree of lack of precision, because the team can be eliminated the first change, and also with this performance players meet a party of penalties and converted the second cycle of cards in the suspension for accumulation of cards comes with a less than in the first round.
So, of rounds, is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not militate against sporting spirit, which is part of the strategic decisions that favor to take maximum advantage of allowing the rules.
In the event that the players did not act to avoid the implementation of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud law), but rather when they chose to take it.
Made a strategic decision without evade punishment or flee the same.
Although the border between genius and fraud law is unclear, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, by two factors: because it was two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which it conducted the transmission of the guideline provocarlas.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
In bids to seize the Christmas dinners of groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year is an avalanche of reserves to 16 and 17.
Rampant celebrations autosufragadas for employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exert of lifeline for catering and the leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive prices adjusted for attracting the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dining or meals, are entrepreneurs and industry associations interviewed.
For end of accounting, the timing of this year (after the new year on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of 13 December, with the result to date of an avalanche of reserves of dinners for days tip (on 16 and 17) and just the previous week.
As has been going on since 2008, when it started the stage in lean times, many companies have removed the communal dining on the budgetary issue.
Not to dispense with the tradition, many workers the keep paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the economic climate, and others are demanding price of battle, confirms the President of the restauració gremi of Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the bosses, to this day, dare not forecast how the celebrations of this month.
"People thinks long before booking."
"wants to leave but alerts is having on the prices," notes.
The business will be anything "to the quality and with a good service," he adds, and recalls that customers are trending down a bracket with the crisis, so that the around 25 euros has become in demand.
In a survey in various establishments centrally located, given the collapse of petitions to the night of 17.
In the Group soteras indicate that there is a real boom in applications for this Friday, with the intention to spend less than 30 euros, which have responded adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In one of the most powerful groups, andilana, with 16 shops in the city (3-room pension of Rita, market, Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has meant more early reserve, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 until 30 euros," detailing.
In an grup, championed by the mussol, attic, ququ, and up to a total of 23 local, remain optimistic after detecting a boom of billing from the second half and a good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The sources stress that 18 also will be a day hiperactivo across groups of friends who precelebran parties.
Its six menus group added one Christmas, with the EUR 30 or more as star budget and the perception that there is willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, like dig.
They also see green shoots in some companies who return to invite their employees and feeling that the size of the groups is something more.
By the fecasarm employers (which includes entities such as the association of bars, restaurants and leisure of Barcelona), his Vice-President, enric gomà, hopes to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "lively," although customers are "bearable."
But the excitement about the celebrations has not fallen, should pay, suggests.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons into "a faster rate than any other country."
Leaks of WikiLeaks confirms the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, filtered by the portal WikiLeaks confirms the huge concerns that causes in Washington, the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details that offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of representatives accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries in terms of nuclear safety, instead of in, "modernization," and that the volatile Asian country produces nuclear weapons' at a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that weapons are not ensambladas but remain in storage for components to hinder its destruction in case of ataque-- constitutes one of the main reasons of devotion in Washington.
It lists the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a previous report to the visit of the then national security adviser, James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumoreada dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear materials."
The high number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and in the programmes of missiles is viewed, not only for America, but also for Russia, as proliferante and reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in levels of education and culture, the extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programs and missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The latest of the documents leaked by the portal of Julian Assange is decreasing cooperation between America and Pakistan in issues of nuclear proliferation and the high rate of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A Member of the embassy in May, as a "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues: "transparency is often non-existent; the offers of assistance are unanswered or are excluded."
In another message, Peter lavoy, an official of the national intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan has nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who left "very clear" that the person responsible, "the army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
The hunting of the head of WikiLeaks
Obama appointed a senior officer of the fight against terrorism to prevent further occurrences.
Interpol issued a red alert in order to monitor movements and locate where Assange.
Everything to do with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to be absolutely certain about the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "find and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not an arrest warrant.
Moreover, it is not new, but dating from 20 November.
And it has to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents of America but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the Creator of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
It was the day 20 when the international police task force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but not revealed yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
So, the 188 countries of Interpol have information to identify or trace Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a man hit by a red alert, many of the Member States, as he explained the organization, considered the so-called network notice the way for an arrest -- will be the Spanish national police, particularly if they have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that is Assange.
The movement has outraged lawyers of Assange, yesterday published a letter to the effect that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39, has been prepared to respond by video link to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the prosecutor in his case, to compare with the mythical pavlovich lavrentiy Beria, the head of security of Stalin.
"This is a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter.
While the world we seek - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of their hijo-- Assange fate remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday awarded from a die an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which called for the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show who was responsible for order that espiaran American diplomats at the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, should resign," he said.
His view was much condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the call for resignation.
"I am not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has a high head of counter-terrorism, rusell travers, to prevent further losses of documents.
The attempt by the spokesman of President Barack Obama for downplaying Assange contrasts with views that these days they proclaim politicians and conservative commentators.
Peter King, a congressman from January will preside over the national security committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to look into the possibility of including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to intervene and their funds and prosecute any you any advice or assistance."
Further still has gone Tom flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has had to withdraw after saying that "Assange should be killed."
"Obama should turn it into objective and using an unmanned plane or something."
He did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the Presidency.
"who is in the government that leaking the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution is a punishment too polite," he declared on fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with wink to the like-minded Carod
The leading Republican will allow for a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more pluralistic and the end of the asambleario system.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without North by the loss of 11 Members, and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that outlined his resignation is insufficient for the akin to ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as his own mentor and that in no way it can cause headache with other currents extinct.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will attempt to win over the new critical wink that will allow it to insulate themselves to the local elections.
For a start, puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able give their judgment on their continuity in secret.
Through ballot papers, and not a show of hands.
If the carodistas want facilitating a vote of punishment to the President, will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as the submission to Parliament.
In several interviews, said he would not be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it is not a good result "for the Bulgarian."
The next to Carod demand the President something more that put his office at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not the answer when puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But without the majority needed to force resignations, will try to agree with the executive a roadmap for May.
To this end, are taking part in the strategic reorientation that management will be submitted to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to bail out puigcercós in exchange for the promise to bring forward the Congress in the autumn of 2011, something that the leadership is already taken for granted.
The leader of ERC admitted that the "polyphony" undermines stability and that its aim is to make, once and for all, the organisation should be able to wash the dirty linen doors.
In this spirit, symptomatic article that the conseller in functions Josep huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologue of puigcercós, the holder of innovació took for granted that the leader will be signed "in exchange for various objectives."
And counted five, two stand out.
The first, "fix" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new faces that whatever sector akin to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC wound up once the asambleísmo mechanism works.
So, calls for a reform of the statutes will hold meetings through elected delegates.
Ending the model asambleario, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team of puigcercós, which already batalló in this regard in the past two congresses.
Indeed, the convulso conclave of 2008 left the job to the direction of revising the asambleísmo in a specific Congress reform of statutes.
This quotation is still pending, as the domestic oil in recent years desaconsejaba deal with the matter.
Now, without critical areas lying in wait, can be a good time to recycle it and try to closed forever.

Promoting Obama on Twitter law in favour of undocumented students
"If coincides to pass the dream act is only fitting, call your senators and ínstalos is to pass legislation," tweeteó President estadunidense on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined today at the national mobilization in support of the dream act, to legalise undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If coincides to pass the dream act is only fitting, call your senators and ínstalos is to pass legislation," tweeteó Obama.
His brief message kept open a cyber liaison with a broader document that asks the public communicate immediately with the senators, given that the legislation is imminent.
"with a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," says.
The message was apparently leaked after the 42 senators Republicans threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless they approve the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the funding of the government.
Blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 senators, Republicans could affect the vote of the dream act and other projects such as the ratification of the new start treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blocking the law dream act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once solved the tax issue, it will be able to adopt a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I think that there is a long time..."
"We all agree that we need to solve the fiscal issue by the end of the year..."
"I think that we can achieve an agreement at any time on this, and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday to urge a "vote of shutting down debate" for the dream act, for which the initiative for legalising undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the dream act or law of the American dream would legalise some 800 000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16 years, have remained in the country the past five years and joined an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters needed 60 votes to approve the initiative, by which require the involvement of a handful of Republicans, even as the party organizations involved lobbying to ensure the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of which supports the dream act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of nebraska, have said they will vote against, and only a Republican has voiced support for the law, Richard place of Indiana.
Therefore, the supporters of the dream act require join several Republicans if other Democrats decided to back the initiative.
Among the Republicans are the most cortejados senadoras from Maine, Olympia snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George lemieux, of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported in the past the dream act are orrin hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have declared that they support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain, has defined its position at the moment.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the dream act is facing the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put his finger on the pulse
The second round of the pleasures of the language was a trip where participants showed the narrative
"that the sex in the language I understand but ... the finger on the pulse? What is expected of me?," inquirió the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of your question (in another festival the Roundtable devoted himself to the sex in the language, he explained).
The finger on the pulse... "puts us in a pickle," espetó dulcemente the writer Argentina to the public, mostly of young, who was quoted in the international festival of the book of Guadalajara (fil) to listen to this Roundtable moderate by marisol Shultz and where participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra montero and Luis García montero.
Luisa Valenzuela reading a text devoted to Gonzalo celorio and Shultz would term after as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist in search of knowing the "spot," is going from doctor to doctor, which lacks answers but trails in the same narrative thread.
The infectólogo goes convinced: "patience is not my strong, perhaps it is my pulse."
In the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatólogo that has robbed the encouragement in half width, but whom he clarifies that it is not a scientific term; it is the psicoanalista who reveals the mystery: "It is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The star sighed eased and concluded "of the issue only I know that is what is real and that does not exist," but believes that the pleasures and the trappings of the language they should go very interlinked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a deleitosa narrative that qualified praise of invention, where the finger on the pulse occurs nowhere but at a time when it is discovered.
With dashes of magical realism, account of a famous hechicera, that the same turn clouds, I came back to men who had gone far or reparaba the virtues that had lost a doncella, narrative that shifted to talk then America, the great novel that he not been a shortage of from the start their own business journalists that the labelled and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of the banked by the captains conquerors.
"Cervantes we invented all (writers) made mockery of witnesses rubber-stamp sham that appear in the stories submitted as real, but never would have led to tell the story of America with imagination which lacked until the decency."
However, he stressed "are fools and liars who best imagine" and is where convergence reality and lie, where it is not known which of the recounted belongs to one side or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its height.
He actually called the "tradition cervantina '.
"by his inheritance are what is."
In turn, the writer Mayra montero acotó and applauded the variety of interpretations that led the fil with his Roundtable the finger on the pulse.
The cubana-puertorriqueña said his towards the great issue of social violence sweeping his country - and shares played a product of the disputes between the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that the good literature, the good poetry, the best songs have a tacit compromise which of course is not premeditated," remarked, after being the reality of the literature is the communication and the scale of the compromise that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night the closed the Spanish poet Luis García montero whose speech also made focus "of the finger on the pulse of writer committed writer."
Consider that in a world which lives in haste, also in customs and intellectual control of consciences in dogmatism, forgetting that "behind every claim there is a small and not behind every denial there is a faint yes."
"to be masters of our thinking and masters of the reality we have to qualify, and qualify means many times put his finger on the pulse and annoying to those people who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, black and white in established ideas and without nuance and annoying to the powers that they prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting recapture the sense of writing.
Romano is going for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has managed to achieve in three times the number decisively.
With the Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, as well as two different styles marked by their technicians, who found themselves with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has managed to achieve in three times the number decisively, although until now it has gone in white, and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentine has finished consolándose with the coin of subcampeón, there has been a step behind the winners and strangely with the same team has played consecutive final.
The strategist santista reached his first final as coach in the tournament opening 2002, when he carried the reins of morelia with which fell to 4-2 before global toluca; then, in the closing 2003 also came to grief, it lost with global 3-1 and was precisely to rayados.
As with Santos Laguna, in the bicentenary 2010, once more with the devils, rubén returned to suffer a setback, as his team ended drawn 2-2 before the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty pénaltis was 3-1 advantage with two chances to clinch the title for finally three players own failed from the 11 steps and suffered the boomerang 4-3.
Rubén lost its final two with the red devils and with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to face the same fate, seeks to rid themselves of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, but says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to leave champion, I do not want to take any of the statistics, it is by a club, by a passion to which I and so on will be the title to my, but this is the most important thing," said helmsman when being questioned about the numbers it against playing the end.
In the end is very old, which, you say, he has learned a lot, "the only education that we can take is that until the referee silbe the end we can celebrate, we are already on the line, players also, because the last time, with two penalties by throwing we were prepared to rush and I believe that this is a lesson, until it is changed, the party can celebrate."
Knowing that this number could be shot dead in criminal law, something that was not worried, because he trusts his players: "you never want to reach the penalty, you want to finish in time, but sometimes there is another, and we must be prepared, in the tournament before we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move the fate, sometimes by nerves or the anxiety of having the title in the hands, but we did, we left something to this end which it does not reach this instance."
Romano has to stop being a technician subcampeón and prove for the first time the glory that deliver diplomas.
The US is changing rules for visa
People have to go to the toilet to applicants of visa before his interview in the consular section; the cost will be less and as well as the time.

The candidate will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate to remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for cases of visas with the request (including visas for seasonal workers) and $390 for visas of traders and investors.
People who want to renew his visa will not have to go through an interview with a consular official, but that only convene the JSA closer where will present their documents and they will take their fingerprints.

NASA announced finding life extraterrestre
The US space agency quoted in the press for tomorrow present a discovery which will impact on the search for living beings in space.
The administration for the national aeronautics and space (NASA) of the United States will be released tomorrow, Thursday, a discovery astrobiológico, that could prove the theory that there is life extraterrestre.
The findings will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1 p.m. in the NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiología, described as the science of the origin, evolution, and future of life in the universe.
To quote the press, NASA that will present "a discovery which will impact on the search for life extraterrestre," which triggered speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures to the couple our and hostile environments that they thought uninhabitable, and which might put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently this was a microbe that was found at the bottom of the monkey lake in the yosemite national park, California, where he lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous to any form of life, as the Lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this capability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our friendly atmosphere.
According to astrobiólogos, whether these bodies use arsenic in their metabolism, it will demonstrate that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, other than we know."
The Space Agency will know the true extent of the findings in a press conference Thursday morning.
In the conference will take the geobióloga pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven benner, one of the scientists who study titan may (the largest moon of Saturn), under the prospect of their chemistry is similar to that of earth.

14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in estrie, there has been dozens of prosecutions in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been detained to face various charges.
The prosecutions have been produced in sherbrooke, orford and stoke, mainly in the places where there was the production of drugs.
"We have seized around 750 plants for cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for the production," says louis-philippe ruel, spokesman for the security of Quebec.
In total, have been arrested 11 men and three women, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men of sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the palace of justice in sherbrooke in the hours following his arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, possession with the object of illegally, plot and theft of services, among others.
These prosecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
"It was the information provided by the public which has enabled us to make the arrests," Mr ruel.
In this police operation with about 70 agents of research module of estrie of security of Quebec, of the police service of sherbrooke and the police department memphrémagog.
It can be controlled effectively against illegal migration without problems
The bill for the Tories, according to the government, should solve the problem of the boats full of illegal migrants, probably will face strong opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I say this mainly in the letter."
"I am here with a party that has created the bit that pisáis," declared the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its present form, that would stop up to a year to anyone that emanates from a vessel identified as transportation of illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms.
The leader of the bloc of Quebec, Gilles duceppe, indicated that he could not support the bill because it aims at the wrong target.
"We are against and, apparently, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government," said Mr duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, declined at a stroke the criticism that his party is not sufficiently strongly with illegal immigrants.
"The neodemócratas agree that action is taken against the illegal boats and that is what we want with another bill, the c-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill because Conservatives attacking refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year," explains Mrs Chow.
The immigration minister Jason kenney has accused the party of the position of playing politics and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians say to Members that do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"expect Canada adopted a firm measures," does the Minister kenney.
The government has announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could lead to the country for elections as a result of their refusal.
However, a conservative qmi told the Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every Member who will oppose explains later to their constituents.
The new unit did not achieve unanimity
Despite the fact that it had announced the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a committee of public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of public safety, Robert dutil, supports this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the department of investigation in New York is question since January last year.
The metropolis has a standing force against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement Tuesday comes as a surprise to more than one.
I should point out that, during a meeting of the permanent Council on police services from Quebec held on 29 October, are never discussed this measure despite the presence of Robert dutil.
That was enough for the critical of quebequense party that is the issue of public safety, Stéphane bergeron, call this announcement as "a rabbit from the hat" and as "a cheap solution of last minute."
The Minister dutil, for its part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"The results will be when we announce," merely underlines.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the csq, réjean parent, there is nothing that can substitute for the launch of a public inquiry.
"The more you persist Mr Charest in preventing the creation of this committee of inquiry, more people share our view, that is to say, that has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a committee of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the national school of public administration.
Out of this impasse, suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate to the controller general to carry out a survey on the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general controller," concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the trustee the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent troupe is not the only project in the making in the government Charest.
Quebec also called on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to which is better adapted to this type of crime.
This request seems to do the public prosecutor of the operation marteau, which reported the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of research.
The Federal Minister of public safety, Vic Toews, confirmed on their part that his counterpart in justice, rob Nicholson, is currently leaning out certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the operation spring 2001 associated with groups of moteros, although there had adapted the penal code, were arrested 131 people.
Later, Ottawa supported the adoption of the law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme vigilance
Various water courses are being closely monitored because of the heavy rains that have been recorded in various regions of the province since Tuesday.
The Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide rolling land in shawinigan, in mauricie.
As a precautionary measure, were evacuated two homes.
By night, there was another landslide rolling land in saint-lin-laurentides, in lanaudière.
Sank a road.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, various regions recorded strong rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
In addition, there are between 20 and 40 additional millimetres from now until Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the valley of the outaouais were the worst hit.
Could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
Given that these were joining the melting of the snow that had already been accumulated in certain sectors, there are fears that various rivers are spilling over.
On Wednesday night, the unit of civil defence of Quebec issued alerts for rivers ouareau and achigan, in lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in saint-jérôme, laurentides, and chêne, in lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of lanaudière heavy rainfall have caused it desbordasen some lakes in sainte-julienne, in sainte-marcelline-de-kildare and rawdon.
In saint-calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As a measure of prevention, ten homes have been evacuated.
In outaouais, the outpouring of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of mansfield-et-pontefract.
The unit of civil security remains on alert and watching the situation closely, as has been indicated annik bouchard, security adviser.
The centre in anticipation of the rising waters of Quebec, for his part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the rising waters from several rivers, in particular the maskinongé, assomption, the ouareau, the achigan, the batiscan and loup.
Blame partly to Dupont
The radio host of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Council rules on television broadcasting (ccnr) for a controversial statements in relation to social assistance and on Haitians, as well as his vulgar language on the radio.
The ccnr believes that Mr Dupont and his team of 98,1 FM Choi also had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, representing unduly negative Haitians and rude language should not be used in programmes broadcast during the day."
The Council has also indicated that the discussions about suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had his own life, do not violate codes on broadcasting.
The ccnr had received several complaints in relation to the comments made in emissions broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision came after a complaint from the united front of people receiving social assistance of Quebec.
The Group complained that the values mentioned in the programme were not correct.
The hosts must communicate reliable data and not leading to deception.
In relation to suicide, presented Stéphane Dupont had shown that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message was that it should not be considered suicide as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the committee considers that the episodes called into question" Dupont Le Midi "have been a sensitive subject in a way that is fair and appropriate."
Therefore, in this regard has been scrapped any guilt.
The latest litigation related to claims made after the earthquake of Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and jean-rené dufort had engaged in a showdown that media coverage has provoked numerous reactions.
The broadcaster of Choi also declared that he had not made any donation to help Haitians because it could not know for sure if people would receive the money.
The committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already done my suspension of three days up there."
"My record is clean for a year and a half," said the broadcaster.
In all the decisions, the committee denounced the release of rude language.
In any case, the radio station choi-fm worked "even more than what is required."
The consequences will be insignificant to the station, which will, among other things, to announce decisions once in the hours of viewing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The montrealés of Algerian origin nacereddine zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda (" kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and Thai box, to get to the tatamis and rings in the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to train in martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to make progress on the professional level.
"in my case, I seek fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that the mixed martial arts, there are few events in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the company UPS, recently gave bad news to their rivals, winning two gold medals at the world championship of the world amateur karate and kickboxing Association (wka), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"Today I prepare to participate in the World Cup of San shou in China."
"They are the athletes who have ended up among the first four points in the last World Championship in each category."
"In 2009, I earned the bronze in Toronto."
"in 2005, in Vietnam, to finish in eighth place."
"in 2007, in China, finalicé the tournament in fifth place, but reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What is interesting is that I have moved forward in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be the first this time or next year!"
The "San shou" or "sanda" is an original discipline of China in the strike with his fists and feet, as well as launching opponents to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The pugilista more famous in this kind of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin cung Le, widely recognised in the world of martial arts.
Although born zemmal just keep a race in his career, no doubt will come to the great tournament as "king of sanda," the super bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious of China," explains the cutesy boy.
"It is the equivalent to the stadium lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semi-finals of their category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"I won it is a true professional," she said.
"There are four competitors by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"the winners of the semi-final encounter at the end of his" category.
"then, the champions of each category face to complement to a single champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million dollars to companies of engineering to the hydro-electric project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
In the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of companies bpr, Dessau, sm and Groupe axor, achieved without a tender after the contract more important, the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of hydro-québec to entrust the private sector their responsibility to manage this important hydro-electric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium énergie gérance won the lucrative contract without that were previously a public tender.
For the party quebequense, resorting to groups of companies raises a serious ethical issue that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminate the competition."
"that is, the people, instead of doing so in secret, now do so openly," said yesterday the Member of the Party quebequense Sylvain simard at a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr simard raised the issue in the National Assembly, because, he says, does not understand how they can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of natural resources, Nathalie normandeau, responded by the afternoon, strongly denied that there has been collusion with this contract.
"I am beginning to cansarme," objected, arguing that the PQ had acted so "dishonest" and "with a lack of rigour."
It noted that "the least" would be that the PQ is disculpase.
The formula of the trusts is a common practice in the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit which allows two or more companies bringing their expertise to answer a tender for a complex project.
The project eastmain presents a high level of complexity, bearing in mind the magnitude of the works.
Work has already begun and durarán until 2012.
Throughout the case, the contract was awarded without that came in game competition; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the formulation of groups has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As posted last week Le Devoir, the formula of the pools in the area of technical advice is being subjected to an investigation into the government.
A quick glance at the commercial register of Quebec to identify more than 200 pools, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its competitors, such as top +, génivar, snc-lavalin, Roche et tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the consortium énergie gérance, Minister normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a dynamic of labour particular and hydro-québec responds specifically to it from the years 1970."
The head of the project eastmain, réal laporte, of the Société d 'énergie of the Baie James (sebj), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the contract of management of the project has been granted directly.
"If respondes for a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can come into contact with the industry and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"however, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the power of the people," said Mr laporte.
The contract granted to the consortium énergie gérance form part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the party quebequense.
The contracts were granted by hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After checking, Le Devoir has identified 109 contracts of technical advice provided between 2002 and March 2010 to companies and their subsidiaries, in particular geotécnicos laboratories.
Snc-lavalin has won 22 contracts, génivar managed 16, 14 and 10 tecsult Dessau, without taking into account their participation in énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, amount to 449.783.344 dollars, including the contract of énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain simard has hinted that the four companies that form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, sm and Groupe axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister normandeau has dropped the PQ is also linked to these companies, "funded," before explaining that it is rather more of their leaders.
A barometer of the responsible consumption. The label 'green' does not inspire confidence.
Greener, but deeply cynical.
The consumer quebequense little confidence in the global sustainable development, as well as in trademarks of fair trade and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe for messages in support of a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers it even slams his commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the natives of Quebec should appear to give little credence to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or in advertising environmentalists, reveals the measurement tool developed by the centre of the responsible consumption of the University of sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers casts doubt on the reliability of the official certificates that carry products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands that have labels indicating that are "ecorresponsables," says the barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the natives of Quebec should seriously speeches of politicians on this issue.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption appears essential to stimulating this sector of consumption, fuelled today by nearly a third of the natives of Quebec should consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of the information make a 46% of consumers endeavouring this option.
It is the second obstacle is identified by the barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of the natives of Quebec should say also distrust of the supposed Returns of products or environmental services that they are trying to sell.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or several products to comply with their beliefs.
A 61% has given priority to purchases in shops in his neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in the region, says the barometer.
Greener and responsible (the rate of responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of 100 this year), Homo consumus of Quebec loves taking the place of the King of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment for the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the barometer, this social conscience seems to be of doors (her car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the natives of Quebec should indicated that used public transport or have shared car to defend his environmental principles.
In addition, the 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive survey of behaviour, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of cycling and walking.
A loan so that the state has excentris
The government of Quebec, which have been asked to commit financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas excentris pursuit the Société Angus and the parallèle, agrees, but only through a loan.
The Société de Développement Angus and the parallèle, who expected a donation of seven billion dollars in the Ministry of Culture to come back to buy Daniel langlois the complex excentris film on the Boulevard saint-laurent and restore it to its true cinéfila, have not got everything they asked for.
The government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but in its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose value would be, in fact, short of initial expectations, it could be a viable solution in favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring, a first action plan and an application of 12.8 billion, but since then, the requests have been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles (sodec), François macerola, who leads the dossier of excentris, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister st-pierre.
He has presented a new report about ten days ago.
However, the sodec received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that it must be phased out completely the hypothesis of a donation from the state.
Let us remember that the association of owners of cinemas and cinematic complex in Quebec is opposed to a direct investment from the state to support the recovery of excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance building projects, as it has done with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various industry representatives did claim a considerable economic aid.
Daniel langlois, the owner of the same, has been for ten years the burden of copyright in their local cinema complex, after finance its own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Council of the Treasury.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and excentris had managed to entice custom.
The company Angus and the parallèle, led by Christian yaccarini, for its part of a campaign financing in private, hoping to raise $700,000 for their way towards the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the parallèle, still casts films in excentris.
The aim of future buyers is reopening the three rooms next February 27, sending the precious film of Xavier beauvois "des hommes et des centre."
However, Christian yaccarini has again been in contact with Le Devoir and we do not know what they think he and his group of the proposals that have been given.
It lifts the veil of Canada acomplejado...
The new American diplomatic cables publicised by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States as the complex of Canadians with regard to the Americans, but reflect both the sense of superiority of recent towards Canada.
The American diplomats were surprised that the Canadian voters do not think in relations canadá-estados us when they go to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to get approved its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the United States Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details that content really substantial.
A cable on 22 September 2008, i.e. during the election campaign, federal described how far the United States are not in the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to US Ambassador to Ottawa, David wilkins.
Mr wilkins offers some explanation on this situation.
"maybe the political leaders are characterised by an inferiority complex almost inherent to the Canadians to tackling the daily domestic issues, rather than leave the choice to the United States (like during the campaign about free trade in 1988)," writes.
Consequently, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant in this election: everywhere, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The Ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries have a strong political and economic relations.
"of course, is the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which should think the electorate to vote."
You can observe this sense of importance also cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, the chargé d " affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"her trip will help to ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan for between 30 000 and 40 000 million dollars," writes Mr breese.
There are no mentions that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that replaced the coalition and the opposition parties condicionaban his survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by Ambassador wilkins alert to Washington about the image increasingly negative convey the drama series broadcast in the CBC of United States.
The Ambassador expressed concern the issue of border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, which are heavy-handed references to Maher Arar, "no-fly-list" or even to the persecution to which the CIA conducts energetic interrogations.
Another cable account that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be prepared to accept some prisoners at Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner responded that yes, but that was "in every case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote "have signed a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the case."
Finally, we can mention that have warmed, the mood in connection with the website WikiLeaks.
Tom flanagan, a former assistant to very close to Stephen Harper, said in the CBC radio that the responsible for this massive should be "shot."
In America they echo of Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan for the renovation of the lighting domestic, commercial and industrial in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an amount that is almost a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilise the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is enshrined in all major projects that the UN expected to be adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments of reduction in industrialised countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, who still hold between 50 and 70% of the market, it sustituyesen with fluocompactas or, even better, with of electroluminescentes diodes (or "thing" in English), we do not have much of the 1.8 million tonnes (GT) of GHGs issued on the planet to enlighten humans.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the cars planetary.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the largest emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to a voluntary reduction to reduce global emissions of GHGs from 53 GT to 49 GT.
However, should be lessened even 5 GT of that sum to stabilize before 2020, rising temperatures to two degrees Celsius to avoid get out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is settling in the form of heat and the remaining 5%, produces light.
In the case of the fluocompactas light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs LEDs, is still two times more energy consumption.
Light bulbs fluocompactas lasts an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that has launched the manufacturer Philips this week (a company which, moreover, has been involved in the study by the UN), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which enables us to have an idea of the savings you get with the substitution plan to apply in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reóstatos and emit very little heat.
Above, contain nothing of mercury.
Various specialists have expressed reservations in relation to the fluocompactas bulbs, because they contain mercury, and that must be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except that manufacturers affix instructions.
However, the report stated, the main source of mercury emissions in the world are not fluocompactas bulbs, but the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury each year.
The report details the benefits that will provide this programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would save it $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power stations which would cost $2.5 million.
Ivory Coast hopes very much the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has demanded the "immediate release" of the results of the presidential election in the Ivory Coast, given that have slipped the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General highlighted the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announced the interim results immediately," highlights a mouthpiece for the head of the UN.
'calls on the parties of Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative to which advertised the provisional results. "
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline of Wednesday at midnight without released the results three days since the elections on Sunday.
Around 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CIS had commented on television that the Commission was working "to announce the results.
The Wednesday have multiplied in the world calls for the CIS then finally the name of the winner of the runoff between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo, and Alassane Ouattara his opponent.
However, the side took account with the annulment by the Constitutional Council "fraudulent" in the North, in the hands of the ex-rebellion forces of new (national) from the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal affi N " guessan, director of the campaign, the President of Ivory Coast, has said that the manoeuvres of intimidation of voters conducted for the National Front in the north of the country had deterred followers of the outgoing President to go to vote.
All the election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of Gbagbo see the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north that belies any relationship with the former rebels, has tried to "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked Gbagbo to them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that they have lost and to submit a complaint to the Constitutional Council having prevented the Electoral Commission the dissemination of the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two years.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday to the political class of Ivory Coast that could be liable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended up in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, which received the support of the former President, Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Mr guérini, brother of the leader of the Socialist Party in the department, jean-noël guérini, has wanted to convey through their lawyers to the judge before his hearing, a document to be explained.
On Wednesday night began to investigate and also explains to one of their people close, Philippe rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr lucien Simon, all he has done his client has been dealing with the waste that must be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the fate of the funds relating to his execution, he does not know anything about it, says Mr Simon.
In the context of this dossier, is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel pinna, former Director General of the services of the urban agglomeration of aubagne, for embezzlement and complicity, but he has left in parole and has prevented from meeting with the players in the case.

Subject Clotilde Reiss: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, was detained in Iran for "spying," has been in thrall to the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and deepening the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
Painting the Élysée Palace has explained its strategy for the Americans to the point of advise them to manage their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
Show how French officials trying to persuade Washington that the release of a young French woman not occurred in exchange for the release of Majid kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, show the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostage taking."
The Élysée Minister for strategic affairs, François richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d " orsay to Northern Africa and the Middle East, Patrice paoli, conversan with the American diplomatic allegrone Kathleen.
He explained the French method.
Advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens detained in force in Iran.
"What noise," they say, "soltad continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of his image.
"When you ask Iranians paréis, hacedlo more often still."
Because, once exhausted attempts at negotiation remained channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "delaying tactics."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "an Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Announcing the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will happen on 16 August day when they are hiding in the French embassy) "will require the players to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230 euros of reward).
In addition, the Élysée Palace foreshadows other hostage crisis, a phenomenon that will increase ."
The Iranians could "in the near future to arrest one of the nearly 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," she says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss released from prison after 12 days, but it is blocked in Iran.
It conveys the following information: the Iranian kakavand Majid, whose extradition by the United States for illicit trafficking of electronic material sensitive towards Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which close the criminal networks Iranians of procurement for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid khakavand is bad news.
How has accepted France an exchange?
Will release of Iran in exchange for the French?
For a new conversation with Kathleen allegrone, on 4 September, François richier ensures that did not happen.
The Élysée Palace, says, "not only are too was surprised by the decision of the judge," but that has been trying to oppose it.
"There has been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overturn the decision," he says.
Mr richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid kakavand remains under "close observation" of the information services.
The Élysée adviser at a telephone number, hanging and, later, reported to us that the Iranian diplomat, "is currently at a Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée Palace does not mince its efforts, uses communiqués and leaks in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is a "very important" and "influential" of "mediator."
Americans are watching this activity with some irony and see which brings its fruits, as several press articles sent the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "'blitz' media coverage of French officials."
What must such "thanks" towards Mr Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"in spite of their declarations of praise, French officials privately admit that only have a vague idea of what they have really done the Syrians'.
Then, the document is the reasons that have led to the Élysée Palace to produce this fiction.
The great effort "aims to strengthen the policy of Sarkozy of opening to Syria," she said.
A policy that began in 2008, which "in the view of many critics in France and abroad, just as premature and desmerecida."
The "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise they can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal also is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US embassy knows from good source.
On 11 August, François richier entrusted: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done something, or not."
"But anyway, we were grateful."
"at least, this should lead to confusion between the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May of 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives in the Élysée Palace.
In a statement, thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syrian played an "active role in favour of the release of our fellow."
From midnight, the young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers participating in online games after midnight to block their access, according to government officials have indicated.
In December, will be submitted a draft law to Parliament to ask companies online games that block access to these Games after midnight to young people of less than 16 years, according to said representatives from the Ministries of culture and family.
"many children play all night and, later, it is difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is needed to protect their health and their right to dream," declared the AFP Jo Rhine, ministerial responsibility for the bill.
Online gambling will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, accurate.
The government is also asking companies to limit the time of daily access to these Games when the parents of the young request, added the officer.
Furthermore, will provide who request free computer programs that can limit the time to connect to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "connected" and newspapers report news regularly on various facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world events online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the world cyber games, where she faced other 58 countries.
2018-2022 world: FIFA appoints the organising countries
In the middle of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of FIFA termed the Thursday to the organisers of the world cups of 2018 and 2022, a clear policy where the struggles of influence and the lobbying may take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, españa-portugal and countries bajos-bélgica).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its introduction in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of those persons who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Heads of Government of the Belgian and Dutch, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the political and economic interests at stake in a World Cup.
The transactions in the wings, therefore, it is possible that will last until the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
However, these considerations do not have much weight to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined so the chances of his country, cradle of football, that only hosted the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by releasing a documentary that was to three influential Members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou.
Enough to upsetting FIFA and shaming those responsible English, that have embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks, with David Cameron at the helm.
The head of government hopes the coup when squabbles with success by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had succeeded in 2005 to London the organisation of the jj.oo. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to restore the luster of England before the EC?
It is not clear, given that the duo españa-portugal consideration with many strengths thanks to their stadiums, ready to go, his experience (world of 82 in Spain, jj.oo in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and his footballing culture.
However, the gloomy economic outlook and financial both countries could break down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all you do is give points to Russia, which became an outsider in weight despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a direct reference to the allegations of the English press against members of the EC.
"They are drawing up their skeletons, trying to involve them pro-actively," said Putin.
By 2022, the United States, which have the experience of 1994, appear to be the most logical favourite.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to require advantage to Japan and South Korea, which have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem premature to two countries that have organised together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the world of 2026 to China, fervently sought by FIFA, that it results in Asia were to lose opportunities for 2022.
In addition to Qatar, which submitted its plan in futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA have no with its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, also could be hampered by the weakness of the rights of TV paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war to FIFA.
Second term: proof
De Gaulle had hesitated.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac took not the slightest doubt.
Nicolas Sarkozy and less still.
A mandate in the Élysée Palace leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
However, this does not combine well with the mystery that is generally associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, there is always that appear to question.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although it creyesen, the friends of Jacques Chirac stated that not ruling out a third term.
On 15 November, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that treats the MEPs from the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Élysée Palace, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some problems.
Is it the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not much less.
The President just indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 restricted to two the number of terms of five years.
Simply sent the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of presidential ones, with a humorous note, at meetings of this kind.
"in the worst, or rather of the cases, still pasaréis seven and a half years with me," had unleashed in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "No penséis that I wonder what will follow."
Their statements the day before it closer to the nomination, nor less.
And comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the fore bringing Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerarse.
Quite the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 evident is what leads to many people in the PS to claim that we arrange battle ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, the right-wing voters prefer the nomination of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% compared to 44%, according to bva-l 'express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP no discussion on the subject," reacted immediately and carefully from the area around the Prime Minister.
"if he thinks that can lose, it will be a candidate," she said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"always lifeline that can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned before the evidence.
The euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of government bills
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow working out the modalities of exit from the crisis, or at least, to announce the shutdown of a large number of operations of unconventional monetary policy that they should be completed at the end of the year.
Because of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the Institute of emission of Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to be so imperative if does not want to risk aggravating a situation more difficult today in the European bond markets.
The political price would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has backed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the solution to the debt crisis of the European States.
Unwilling to say whether he thought that the Central Bank should do more, by for example its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans'...
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, there was more eloquent regarding their intentions, adding only that the programme of buying government bonds in the secondary market "remained" and that "we will see what we decided" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the purchase of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled in the past week to about 1.35 billion euros.
In addition, according to the indiscretos market operators, yesterday would have bought again titles in Ireland and Portugal.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired titles for an amount of approximately 67,000 million euros from May 2010.
Between market operators, not the slightest doubt that they purchases (consult page 29).
Economists also expect any significant changes of direction.
Although the loans to more than three months have already disappeared in the arsenal of the ECB, it still makes appropriations unlimited liquidity conditions beneficial and predictable that vary between one week and three months.
Economists expect today to be extended this provision for some months.
"I imagine it will modify its program."
"If not, ran the risk of causing the new tensions in the short term," she said Michael schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipates by Norbert bräms, an economist in salt.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions in the market of public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of those obligations to which the market remains stable," adds Norbert bräms.
Bearing in mind the importance of the exhibitions of European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the euro zone, the Institute of emission has no choice but to maintain their presence in the market.
"must compensate any price the lack of investors in the market and to ensure that prevent a sharp rise in yields subscribers for the States most vulnerable," was yesterday a major operator of obligations.
Because, if interest rates are sky-high, States will have even more problems for reducing its debt, or even to stabilizing.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi weathers the Storm
After that it started the week with a disturbing, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the decline of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
On the way out of a meeting with the Minister of economy, the regional Presidents have argued that listened to Giulio Tremonti describe the situation of "unfathomable" and that it hoped a weekend "unpredictable," statements contradicted later by the individual.
In any event, on Tuesday the difference with long-term rates Germans had reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of the contracts of hedging against the risk of default (crq) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the Germans was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" over "the turbulence in the markets" and by contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," says Irwin stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, the problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the revenue associated with the same, which means that the State run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have dealt a heavy blow to the government.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget that is being debated in the Senate is based on figures from 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit would represent the 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the suggestion that can be applied new budgetary arrangements after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, should be adopted new austerity measures," does the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The foundations of the economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time ago," arrigo sadun, the Italian manager in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, short-term or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011,], the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are lower than those required of other countries," says Pier Carlo padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Is the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a no-confidence motion in the House of Deputies, behind which could anticipate the elections at the end of March.
In this case, it would open a little for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
The Europeans are thinking about strengthening the mechanisms to combat the crisis.
Christine Lagarde has already said yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already shown on Sunday evening and by the day, that Europeans are clearly showing solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of its currency and its currency area."
Although he was on the decline seen yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot speak of a principle of standardisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor " s announced that could lower the rating of Portugal, the more frequent today of speculation.
"like in May, really lack clarity and transparency policies, which weighs significantly on banking systems," believe economists from exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the pace is far slower than the pace of the market."
Aware of this gap and of the dangers lurking, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the mechanisms of exit from the crisis already in existence.
The informal consultations between the ministers of finance that are most directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts from the G-20 are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin in early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the order of the day, the kind of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro zone in the colimador markets (look up the road).
As regards the EDF financial stability (EFSF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore travels through Asia to inform investors of the Far East on the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, certainly preparing the ground.
It is predicted that the initial emissions of titles of the EFSF must be introduced next month.
Yesterday, a US official has entrusted to Reuters news agency that the United States would support a potential increase of the funds mobilised by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
With regard to the countries that are first in line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms will only add to the austerity measures with an effect closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move in a different way to that followed in Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs seek international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and decide the structural reforms that they consider essential to increase the confidence of a lasting.
The European funds, finally, there are options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets of public duties.
In passing through Paris, November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to trot out the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the market of the European public debt, consider that an amount of around EUR 100 million extra would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism which today with 60 million euros.
A Council which, without doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on Orange alert
The snow is still causing difficulties of movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on alert Orange because of the risk of snow and ice training.
Eure, eure-et-loir, Les Deux-Sèvres Vienne and have joined the two departments that were already on alert, 18 from Wednesday to half a day and two, dordogne and Gironde, joined the Group for the night.
According to France météo, the heavy snow falls affect North of Gironde and Charente, although snow also slightly in island of France.
We expect to see layers of snow of between 2 and 5 cm, promptly of between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, as well as Charente-Maritime, côtes d 'armor, Finistère, Gironde, dordogne Poitou, and of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and lemosín.
The snowfall are sufficiently robust to cause difficulties of movement and affect some economic activities, alert météo France.
In the côtes d 'armor, has banned access to a number of minor roads to heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including axes guingamp-lannion and saint-brieuc-loudéac.
According to the marshals, the movement in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, and recommend that no lead was safe in case of need and banned the movement of certain vehicles TERs during the day.
During the Thursday, has been banned at the school transport in Picardy.
There was no specific measure on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The Prefecture "urges all drivers to lead with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of civil aviation (dgac) asked the airlines that anulasen Thursday 25% of its flights at the Paris airport Roissy and 10% in orly because of the snow.
The dgac recommends to air passengers that are put in touch with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
One of the grand Paris: financial early drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the island of France has reached its climax, raining down billions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we speak of the 23 million for the metro, the grand Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this GSP, the state has announced a fund of EUR 400 million.
In theory, this sum that will allow then to the GSP borrowing in the markets for part of his double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first bills.
The finance letter from 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase in the tax offices in the island of France.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "in the interest of public institution Société du Grand Paris."
In addition, is set in numbers: "the product of this tax is of 117 million euros a year."
The second is a modification of the offices that already exists "to modernise, increase their product and make this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would be achieved with this method?
Who knows.
In the text does not give figures.
But it is far from 4 million.
"What is needed is that tax revenues are added to the EUR 400 million of the allocation of funds which will mobilise the state and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project advances," you can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP not surprised this system.
"When you create revenue (the two taxes], we can cover the studies for three years and then get the 4 million later, according to make sense of."
"We will in the budget and will be used as needed."
The GSP estimates that empecerá to receive the 4 million in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This arrangement, in which the 4 million promised on credit, can lead to a parliamentary debate slightly firebrand.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
But hackers and spies diligent
The subject Wikileaks has a dual value.
On the one hand, uncovered an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal to the hypocrisy governing relations between the Member States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, announces profound changes at international level and provides for a future dominated by the regression.
But go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each case created by a secret service (regardless of the nation which appertains) consists entirely of cuts in the press.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those that belong to Berlusconi) and the profile siniestramente ridiculizador of Khadafi has for a long time giving ideas to the cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule whereby the secret files just must be trained by news public knowledge is essential to the dynamic of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to publications esoteric, you will find that each work repeated (on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-château, the templarios or the rosacruz) exactly what was written in the earlier works.
This is not due solely to the authors of ocultistas texts do not want to do new research (or does not know where to look for an update on the non-existent), but because those engaged in ocultismo not just rely on what you know, what reconfirmed that had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret files.
The rapporteur is perezoso, as is perezoso (or has little desire) the head of the secret services (if it could be, I know, editor of the Libération), which only considers true what can recognize.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that took the American Embassy in Rome at the State Department was the same that posted the Newsweek the previous week.
So why have caused such a stir revelations of these cases?
On the one hand, just say what all cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and the Heads of States can be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost his diplomatic role and, with the exception of some exercises limited representation, have been transformed into centres of spying.
Any viewer watching films of research knows perfectly well, just aparentamos that we do not know for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact repeat publicly infringes the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker anyone can check the secrets more secrets of the world 's most powerful country significantly affects the reputation of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal is affecting both the victims and the "butchers."
But enter the true nature of what has happened.
It used to, in the era of Orwell, could be designed to power as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has become reality from which it can monitor every move by phone, each transaction conducted, hotel visited, motorway taken, the citizen will make this way on a complete victim of eye of power.
But when it is proven, as happens now, even the were the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control will be one-way and becomes circular.
The power controls to each citizen, each citizen but (at least the hacker, chosen as the vengeful of citizens) can access all the secrets of power.
How can aguantarse power that can no longer or retain their own secrets?
It is true, as you said Georg simmel, that a real secret is a secret empty (and a secret vacuum can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a secret vacuum, without secrecy, given that comes from the public sphere; but they uncovered, and WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton was classified, empty means removing any power.
WikiLeaks he has not done any harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but yes, and far, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted to a power so powerful?
It is clear that, in the future, states can no longer put in the network no classified, as it would be as do this in a poster in the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, we cannot expect to keep confidential talks by telephone.
Nothing is easier to find out if and when a Head of State has shifted and it has contacted one of the peers.
How will they keep in the future relationship private and confidential?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prognosis is about science fiction and, therefore, novelesca, but I imagine to government agents that move inconspicuously in stagecoach with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much, hiding some data written on the heels of her shoes.
That information is then, in a single copy, in drawers closed with key: after all, the attempted espionage Watergate had less success that WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now running as a crab, that is to say, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has become to create a Telegraph with cables (phone).
The video tapes (analogue) had allowed researchers to study film a movie step by step, advancing and receding, discovering all the secrets of the editing, whereas now CDS (digital) just any headway or backtrack from chapter to chapter, i.e. to massive proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in plane, with movements that entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, there is nothing outside of normal politics and communications they take us back to the cars of horses.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what is secretly plotting in embassies.
Today, there are embassies which call for confidential information to the press.
Climate: the messes of France in their promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to examine whether promises of funding quickly unlocked (so-called fast start or available) made by the developed countries.
And they have revealed the French messes.
In the Copenhagen agreement, the developed countries undertook to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to provide 7.2 million euros in three years and France earmarked million euros (420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best to convince its partners that its commitment to financing fast start is real: a report detailing the measures its Member States, a press conference, a major event, the distribution of leaflets...
The operation transparency worthwhile result and was appreciated for what it is really: developing countries and civil society would all developed countries do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU advertises 2010 has released EUR 2.2 billion, which puts it in the right direction towards the fulfilment of its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation closely, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that we make an additional effort, without harming the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, it has not come to an agreement on which means "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken into account the year 2009: the international funding and add 150 million in three years in terms of funding fast start.
Other countries have adopted similar references in the year or at the level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" in the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is a reference to the cost of previous years and the overall level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while intends to respect their commitment in terms of funds' new and additional ..."
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each person chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowing amounts to a euro donated.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions which are based on more effective technologies), it is untrue, presenting a euro that will recover as equivalent to a euro dona... as much, just to be paid for their commitments to the cost of the loan to the country that gives the loan (that is, the equivalent to an interest rate).
But France is useful such reasoning: "respect" their commitment of 420 million euros doing a 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and a 8.5% of donations (36.1 billion euros); consult the document from the EU to see it with their own eyes.
It is the only EU country that is so often the loan.
Germany used in a 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfill their commitment, France only contributes 10 cents and believes that the effort is comparable.
A neat trick!
In short, in its financing fast start, France made a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions at the time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, manages to give the impression that spends 420 million "new and additional," as it had promised.
The handling of the Ministry of Finance (which is bercy who has occupied the arbitration) could have a negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States to continue donating when they can simply pay?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on the early financing is peanuts, relatively short term, in relation to the whole of the negotiations on the climate.
But it could be a bit more in the vast machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully it otherwise.
Whatever it is, it is vital to learn of this first year of available financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in the method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way that other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could make moving debates on gambling at stake in relation to the funding in the long term (another crucial area that is currently under discussion): not inevitable for the issue of "additional" or the method for measuring lending.
France could change its stance to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
Therefore, we hope the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and about his view of the "additional" and the use of the loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to make progress in the negotiations.
Warning of the pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years ingested in a day 81 different chemicals, suggests a study published on Wednesday by the Association générations futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, who warns that their results "did not have a significant statistical value given the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problems raised," bought in supermarkets in oise and Paris between July and September, which tends to have a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack each day.
These meals taken as a model, who observed the official recommendations (five parts of fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic insurance, as well as 37 to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies of various institutions like the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"although, in almost all cases, not exceeded the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to pollutants possibly carcinogenic and / or EP is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain alone more than a dozen possible carcinogenic waste and three classified as carcinogenic insurance, as well as nearly a score of waste that can only hurt the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the College, contains trace amounts of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to beans from Kenya, including in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, the canned tuna and even the loaf of bread or the gum were aderezados with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis found the presence of nitrates and cloroformo.
At dinner, the slice of salmon was the most "nutritional" with 34 chemical waste identified and even the analysis of the plate of plastic used for heating food in the microwave was not entirely clean.
The final risk that create these "cocktails of pollutants" to the consumer "is probably underestimates," says the study.
The Alliance ecología-les Europe Verts (ee-lv), for its part, has proposed "compared to the seriousness of the situation" a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increasing diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study by the Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of pesticides 365 different identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
