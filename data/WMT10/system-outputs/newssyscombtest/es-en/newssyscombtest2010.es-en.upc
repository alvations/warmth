The lack of snow in the mountains concerns the hotel
Not only the mantenedores of telesquíes in Krkonoše preoccupations avenues without snow.
The lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše can still be achieved free rooms for all the winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and attitude.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The people look offers, observed prices, but still has a fear of book with commitment.
And if we call, ask immediately on our opinion, if these Christmas will have snow or mud, "mentioned the mantenedor of the portal for information Spindl. Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to move in a Špindlerův Mlýn satisfied according to their expectations, should not hesitate in reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and bring the quality of accommodation Secondly, can try to wait a few days.
The hotel of Špindlerův Mlýn offer especially weekly stays for attitude.
I believe that the will offer, but soon generate and provide shorter stays.
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency of Vrchlabí, still offering free beds for all the dates of the winter.
Now, what interests us most is the festive week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats ofertadas remains free.
So we have already prepared some Christmas stays of last moment, "mentioned the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
Sold well also the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold to regulate.
This year the interest in the winter stays is undermined by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
No one wants to move the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the avenues remain nevadas during the week, the dates of Christmas will dry up too, "believes Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five per cent better.
For Christmas and the New Year's Eve, we have the latest squares free.
The interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, "reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the New Year's Eve stays are already occupied in the hotel Omnia, near the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel Janské Lázně at Christmas half of beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are approximately sixty percent of the ability of occupation.
February has been slightly weaker, but as fall snow, interest in the rooms in Krkonoše increase surely mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
However, from the moment it seems that the hotel of Krkonoše they run the appetite of snow waiting.
Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there is rainfall in the mountains should nevar.
But then again rise temperatures, informed Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, the Institute Hidrometeorológico of the Czech Republic.
EE.UU.: the repetition is the mother of the wisdom
It is true that Barack Obama, the President with the reputation of the man more intelligent, as a pupil diligent repeated in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid.
When we finally revealed its Afghan approach, waiting with bated breath, showed that it is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the "everyone as in Iraq," but not hesitated to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for their own statement: "a new way forward '.
It was he who, three years criticized the idea of Bush's new military reinforcements sent to Iraq, the country is suffering by the civil war, and that is criticised as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that the strategy of Bush, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today we are not talking none of Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush does not improved, however objectively ceased to his successor an initial situation much more favourable than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects to retake the miracle.
The captains of field again ask you to expand the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. It, even though the traditional subordinate relations, subject to the fusileros hesitant in the White House to a sharp criticism.
Asked 40 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but not occurred nothing better, so that at least deceived general about 10,000 military.
To ensure that Europe has promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the whole strategy of Obama seems its aim to start withdrawing troops in Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this procedure in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama raised more questions than answers that offer.
Many doubt that the increase in the same result that the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organised, its leaders to respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to be wary of one and does not meet any agreement.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan forces of security, if they are used to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain just a Potemkin village. After him stay patriarchal tribal relations.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to relations confused, even more complicated by the Pakistani influences and Iranians.
Even establish a state that is capable of action, "" a minimum target of the whole operation, it seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy of Obama clashes for his voluntarism.
During the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now at bursting point.
Only a romantic soul, which does not know nothing of the reality, may believe that the military sent to war to "return soon home", will make some miracle here.
From the political point of view, to set the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Taliban is regarded as an indirect declaration of the American defeat.
The recent NATO Summit showed that the Europeans have increasingly willing to participate in the military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and we do not want to explain to their constituents, what relationship has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affect the situation, it is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and sanctions augmented not exercise any effect on the Iranians, the EE.UU. will have to take a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, under Obama, America initiated the triumphant withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years for the presidential elections and therefore still a long time to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs receive this year the bonuses in cash.
The entity we announced to react to the harsh criticism of their practices of salary.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, actions which may not be sold at a minimum period of five years.
Moreover, the actions can be withdrawn in the case of which had assumed excessive risks.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the power in the long term.
I assume that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest journey must undertake, mentioned the former investor banking of entity JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The devil is in the details, added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after paragraph almost 17 million dollars (almost 300 million CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, 20 million dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced the Wednesday hanging tax of just once, with a tax of fifty per cent, bonuses for banking that exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less physical
Five women, which is a record, received today in Stockholm in the hands of the King Carlos XVI Gustavus Sweden Nobel prizewinners of this year, in categories and specialist literature.
In addition to the four scientific, featured among the recipients also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine they received two biólogas Americans, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as your compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of the translated.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry it received the Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz by the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomas.
The ultimate prize awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, received the American Elinor Ostrom and his countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of a report.
The only category of specialist, without a woman premiada, was physics.
This prize is received today scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of ópticos cables, and George Smith with Kurtz Boyle by the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all the digital cameras, faxes or telescopios.
Each rewarded received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to ten billion kronor (approximately SEK 25 million Czech).
In the case of having several recipients in each category, the prize was distributed among themselves.
The traditionally more expected, the Nobel peace, we received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, the US President Barack Obama.
In his speech acknowledged the controversy have been rewarded, since it is at the beginning of his career and furthermore is at the head of a country which participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend its policy added, however, that in certain situations the wars are essential to achieve peace, although its price is high.
The Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus I invited the Castle
The President Václav Klaus will receive the Friday morning at the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is raising of their residence in the government, because we do not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, adopted on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It means that the budget, and perhaps also the permanence of Janota in the cabinet, will be the subjects of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the quotation reported the spokesman of the President Ochvat Radim.
On his residence in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163,000 million kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted on Wednesday, the proposals of the left for the transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because we make covertly increase the budget deficit.
Among the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, begin to be controversial future activities of the cabinet bureaucratic Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring on the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version adopted by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of energy-saving measures, imposed in autumn by the government of Fischer to curb the public debt.
Klaus can but must not sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is to say, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, that we can support in a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, believes the President.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The Vice-President of ODS, Petr Nečas, said to ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described words like "strong" sentences.
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the deficit of the budget is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. Outstrip the 200 million kroner.
Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The popular were also happy.
Mandela in the new movie Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: invincible, tracing much about the country, their struggle and their victories, although some criticisms say that the roles protagonists of American actors play.
The history speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The indefatigable fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in your biography by the American actor Oscar-winning winner, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him in the film interpretase Eastwood.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I said: "When I interpret, need to have access to you.
The 78-hour player and two years, who received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing milion dollar baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being slaves, the chairman of the fictitious EE.UU., and even in Evan Almighty God. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their activities in order to put an end to apartheid in South African Republic.
He was released in the year 1990 and for four years became President of the country.
In 1993, received the Nobel Prize for peace.
Invictus invincible - is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the author English William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak as he
The film is a true story on Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the team of African rugby, "Pienaar, to help to unite the country. Kick the, the new President, knows that after apartheid their nation remains racial and economically divided.
He believes that it is capable of uniting their people through sport, and therefore decides to join the rugby players, which belong in the global measure to outsiders.
The African team manages to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela reached cinemas.
It had no other goal to play this role in such a way that outside as similar as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world political were the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dine with him, be the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to strengthen the hand to Mandela.
I found that clamp the hand, receive their energy, it is transmitted and had the sense of knowing how it feels you said.
For me, it is important to try to become a person differently.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national team of rugby, which dominated white players.
The actor said to have had six months to prepare for a role in the tough Rugby World.
A great surprise to him, when it was finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember being called the door, he opened and the first thing that I said to François Pienaar in my life was: "in the film sound much higher".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: invincible received positive reviews and also refers to the Oscar-winning ambitions.
The film critic of the magazine daily variety Todd McCarthy summarised its assessment with these words: "was a story very good, a film very well done."
In the write-ups of films on the website rottentomatoes. COM, Invictus received a 76 percent of positive assessments.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did evidence of a missile
On Norway observed a special bright effect of unknown origin.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia ended recognising yesterday that near the border with Norway made evidence of an intercontinental missile balístico.
The launch failed again. The missile, "Bulava", previously earmarked for the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Mr Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect in the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, it was not the Bush or there was a mistake in the air.
In the Russian newspapers write "Bulavá" as "a missile not fly."
A missile that not fly, but is conspicuous.
During this, the 13th test, was not the principle no problem.
At the end of the flight were of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine erupted in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, illicit up in the White Sea.
This type of missile opens the launch of a ship is moving black and at the same time.
It is therefore likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an unidentified object wheel, in reality outside the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegian since the first time not like lucid policy that a Russian missile.
The generals this time they defend stating that cannot be simply to speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases are engines averiaron immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen proved unsuccessful.
The success of almost 50% full of optimism to the generals and therefore still saying that "Bulavá" a day fly unhindered and even achieved carrying until ten blocks hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight is full of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed the 51 years an annual contract with CSKA Moscow

Fetisov completed his career at the age of forty years in 1998 and currently chairing the CSKA.
After Kulyash essence were wounded, we urgently need to another defender.
Fetisov constantly practised and has committed to help the team.
We have only to solve some formal issues, quoted the Agency PDB Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of the club of Moscow.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single party.
I believe that Fetisov is one of those who fail to lift the mood of the other players, mentioned Nemchinov.
According to the PDB if Fetisov returns to the lines of ice, will become the most long-ruling professional player in the Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty years, during the entire season, and managed to kick 15 and 26 seat.

Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the trade unions happen throughout the extra work.
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared on Monday the emergence on strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the factory of automoviles Hyundai.
The direction, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a Saturday over time.
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan of manufacture, which is essential. Therefore proposed voluntary extra work for Saturday, 19 December, that is to say, it will operate in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 employees working time on Saturday.
The bonus is paid for the last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with the extra work offered.
Employees may make the bonus overtime or can take a day on 28 December, that is to say, prolonging in one day the Christmas festivities, mentioned Vaněk.
Moreover, all employees of the shifts of Saturday receive money for the travel and for food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic from the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, to stop the manufacture last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided immediately cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned Vaněk.
The employees of the factory of cars were forced to work for two hours more besides shifts of eight hours and this situation last virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement unions cancelled the emergence of a strike.
Another negotiation between the direction of the factory and the Union must be made on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, if it is committed to meet the requirements and signed the document, are prepared to cancel the emergence on strike.
The situation in the car factory was aggravated last week, on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously came on strike by the frequent additional work.
Also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The direction in which employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and power supply cars.
Trade unionists in his statement of the emergency by strike on Monday, demanded that none of the employees, that last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, were penalised in any way.
In what concerns the extra work, the unions demand that the company is reduced to a minimum.
Moreover, this year required for this work remuneration of SEK 5.
The factory of cars in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2 000 employees.
The manufacture in series was launched last November.
Until the last September manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective until the HIV virus encallecidos' "
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans is evidence of new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance improved is the fact that it is effective against the virus resistant to medicines.
In some cases, this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines accessible.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can prolong it significantly, thanks to a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side-effects.
If the replication of the virus were not removed completely, it created the so-called resistant viruses; against them, no longer function medicines.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility to dominate the resistance of the virus.
Calls metalocarboranos showed that the substances have an effect on the albúmina, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are compounds on boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all medicinal products used today, and therefore can solve the problem of the resistance.
In his work scientists are new, ‘mejorados’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albúmina of the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a three-dimensional only structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case for cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient
The proteasis HIV is a albúmina of the HIV virus, and it is imperative for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is not the splitting of the HIV virus and does not create mature infectious and corpúsculos of the virus.
If you stop the proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the scientists in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a number of compounds in those two pairs of cages (see the table) are united by a short number, which remains amended systematically.
A little more weak, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against the proteasis HIV was conducted in test-tube, and also against their variants resistant, obtained of patients with HIV.
The effect of the metalocarboranos in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as the medicines clinically used, though not lose their effect on variants resistant, in which the medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities as the biological and chemical stability, lower toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, which are metalocarboranos interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the Structural Biology laboratory in the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetica in the Academía of science.
Jostling for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he argues
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the Prime Minister as heavy sentences.
They say that it leaves time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas Prime Minister must decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to be supported in the minority, which seeks to combat the growing shortage, or if it wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and the social democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals modificativas by the left, by more than 12 billion kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government complained to the proposals of ODS, since cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the Chamber and the desire of the government, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusion and uselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disillusionment and the feeling of futility; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten with the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals modificadoras, the situation could have been different.
According televize Česká Janota called a meeting with the Prime Minister.
It indicated that you are planning to remain in the function.
The reason is his disappointment on the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in government have nothing to do the nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister also should clearly say, if you will resign, if the House adopts other laws that increase the deficit, for example those which relate to subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: the Ministers nominated by the ODS are not the fault
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and of the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed Topolánek in the news of the text of the EE.UU.
Recalling that, in several ministries in the jobs of people's lieutenants belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to accept the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit in the public finance, "is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I shall ensure that told journalists in the Chamber of Deputies Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS gave at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that ODS Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies is likely to vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly urges the members of ODS to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, are not small children, reacted to the question whether ODS cannot be concerned by the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I am not realised that my vote not.
The resignation of the mandate knew that, in the following months was especially bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek.
According to the new timetable ČD trains move less trains for almost the same charges
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December cancelled or restringuirán some fast trains local and less used and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The extension of the trafficking will fall into two percent in comparison with the day after the new timetable of trains enters into force.
The majority of charges including the basic price and customer will not change.
More chances of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line unacarretería added Pendolino.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not move in Bratislava.
In line Prague - Písek České Budějovice - circulated less fast trains, restringuirán Prague - Letohrad direct links.
In the regions, the largest reduction in the transport planned by dráhy is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, the transport will increase in Prague and the surroundings.
It also cancelled two night trains in traceable Prague - České Budějovice Tábor - and some fast trains across the line Prague - Písek České Budějovice - will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the most dramatic change is the introduction of a new hotline of Milovice in Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice must change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15. Line of the system Esko, on the outskirts of cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The links to long distances to the capital will end in the station Hlavní Prague Nádraží.
ČD introduce more Pendolino SC links between Prague and Ostrava and trains at Šumperk/Jeseník circulated every two hours.
On the basis of 13 December travellers will not return to travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for the regional railway of this year: 200 million more than before
The rapid trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses dráhy receive the next year four billion kronor in total, like this year. The local trains are responsible for the regions, the next year will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast trains local and dráhy have a contract new ten years, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps do not therefore increased the price of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes occur only in the notes of a day - ČD Net and cheap tickets in the Internet eLiška.
Without a card for travellers customer the price ČD Net increase of 450 SEK 600 SEK.
The price of eLiška depend on the distance, until now the single price of SEK 160 for travel between any two regional cities.

For many years, dreams with the role and I am preparing well to play it.
Many times I found in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as they say - charge their energy, mentioned in an interview after the launch of the holiday in Los Angeles.

Jančura submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will present a complaint for slander three hetmánes socialdemocráticos.
It is Michał Hašek of the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetmán of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura as mentioned in twenty minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, to maintain the regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended signing contracts to the long term with České dráhy.
All three hetmánes are attacking us and talk about the fact that we are taking the "of the cake", however brought only the offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the price of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing else to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
At the same time have the evidence of all the regions. According to him have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
Why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this denunciation by the continuation of the US medial of Mr Jančura, which serves as a free advertising for business and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and of my region, and I call on the other hetmánes to do so too.
I assume that, on this occasion too will demonstrate clearly that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional transport by rail, and uses lies and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week, which spent several million kroner in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
In Radiožurnál told that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
There was, that the campaign will be conducted against the corupción as such.
Jančura initiated the campaign after the regions was agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the assignment of approximately 150 billion crowns not summoned a tendency.
According to Jančura similar steps are at variance with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD, owing to its criticism of the transport ferroviaro in the regions.
The only threat was that, if we do not, we might lose the licensing of buses.
It presented as a member of ČSSD, I know what Mr concerns, I am not going to say your name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine will be free and voluntary neumococal
The vaccine neumococal from January will put an end to the usual custom.
As a first vaccine must be free to families and at the same time voluntarily.
However already appear views, that the obligatory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the vaccine against free neumococos complete.
The Institute of medicine is already setting maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also have already clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January may receive free vaccination neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before, have to cover other doses of vaccine also.
The first dose of the vaccine needs to be received between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
Last year, the fourth part of the families left voluntarily vaccinate their children against neumococos.
Parents however picked up by a dose 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate the smallest children need four doses.
Generally experts estimate that insurance companies poured into the vaccines of 300 to SEK 450 billion annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children vaccinated.
Until now, the State spent across the vaccination of children approximately 500 000 annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so-called package of Janota.
The neumococo is the cause of the otitis media, but also of the serious infections including the meningitis and blood poisoning.
The neumococales infections in our country die every year according to the investigations in the hospitals 28 children not older than the 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic's cover neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will it be compulsory vaccination?
However, at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be mandatory in future.
From January must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The obligatory vaccine would be better addressed by example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its partnership spreads vaccines neumococales already long ago.
The experts in an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntarily.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we must now undertake mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health however does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against neumococos.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, claim doctors
The chairperson of the society of paediatricians Odborná Společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognises that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, one could argue about the reduction of the number of doses. "in the situation, when the vaccine costs amounted so high, relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year more than 80 porciento young parents leaves vaccinated against neumococos their babies.
The vaccine neumococal is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by companies of health, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save course in the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
Yet the paediatricians are worried by the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, like the State gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take the money from the health insurance."
Doctors for that will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the paediatricians invested in vaccines 40 000 per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.

Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have sought to ban the construction of new minarets and in which there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar, has written a detailed report and looked on the possible integration of Muslims (which in reality are integrating) in a secular societies more openly on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as devotees of the past work of the author “Por what the French do not love veils "(" why the French don't like Headcarves ") (2006), a study elegant and detail argued for a problem that divided and aimed at the country over a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book of Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what they are saying politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
Past months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide to 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen Islamic “espacios called ".
He is a good listening reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that preoccupy them.
Should a Muslim marry it in a mosque or in a city (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
How can a Muslim woman is married to a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These issues are apparently mundane, argues, things of daily life, which concern the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab Muslim scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is to open the debate on how to be at the same time, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern, secular society.
They fail to disseminate this argument completely.
The Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts of Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the values Muslims and the French secularism could be compatible.
But the adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Question to what extent French policymakers (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defends the secularism) are genuinely committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims have probably more unjust treatment that the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish, who have also had to do its historical commitments with the secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived “un adjustment of values'.
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say “Sí, but not yet. "
The most devastating picture of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat of the planet.
It defines the ice is melting at an alarming rate, carrying it with the life that cannot survive in any other way.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in the waters recently open, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In “Sobre ice thin "(" on thin ice) Richard Ellis, a writer and ilustrador depicts a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
Aware of the difficult history and the policy of whaling, describes the long tradition of explorers of the Arctic, who gave evidence of value is confronted with the white bear.
The meeting of the US Nelson as a courageous cadete 14 years, fighting only with the end of his mosquete, it is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, caught while nadaban following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the twentieth century, displayed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the bodies of zoos are still generally a millonésima part of the area of the scope of an adult savage. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar bears resident in Singapore was a green algae that grow within the areas without mincing their stripe.

Ellis calls for tales of other writers and historians, and often back to the threat that hunters presented to the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, EE.UU. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in motonieves use of assault rifles high power to demolish their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two nations cazadoras where the ice will last for more time.
In its new book, “Después Ice "(" European "), ice Alun Anderson, a former editor of new scientist, offers a clear and chilling story about the science of the Arctic and upsettingly gaze of how one can transform the future of that place.
It is not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor the oceanógrafos can explain properly the speed of the changes.
It is not for lack of commitment.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen travel at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century gave evidence for the first time on the posting of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the cold war drew up a map of the movedizos lifelines of ice that circulate below the masses of ice.
The exploration satellite and the extensive series of probes montadas in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but acampados resistant individuals in the cold still make many tasks.
Mr Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the system tributary within the Arctic ice, formed by chorritos Salina water to be comprime while freezes.
But since the bear on the surface until the wonders microscopic particles of the Interior, are all condemned once the ice of the summer withdraws, it believes can happen at any time between 2013 and 2050.

Marines between 6 that place in the graves of SEK Arlington
PFC. De'Angello Robinson, of 19 years, traveled seven hours in bus to put a single krona in the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines that travelled since Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., the National Cemetery Arlington for decorar graves, was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once were standing in his boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like someone to do likewise for me, therefore only try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place SEK in the graves of the veterans in several sections of the cemetery of Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the company of SEK Worcester in Harrington, Maine, gave start in the event when he and other people decided decorar several hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, and his wife Morrill Karen make the journey each year stalling in different cities along the way, for oficiar events devoted to military and victims of terrorism.

For the second year, as a result, the Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars to buy and transport the SEK.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years of Westminster, said that made the journey to Arlington in honour of her deceased husband, a military career.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was your way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, said.
It is as visit a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, volunteers caminaron via the extensive meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were directed at older graves of the First World War, the second world war, and the Vietnam war, because they do not receive many visits as the graves new, said the organizers.
The atmosphere was cheerful while children playing and couples were taken in hand, while carrying the fresh pine to sepulcrales tombstones.
Every krona move was of a Green deep, with a small red bow tied in the upper hand.
Near there, Section 60, where the bulk of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United service organizations (Association for the soldier) donated DKK 1,000 for decorar section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, other rezaron, and the families and friends are supported in each other in the air glaciers.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small black and white vehicles registered placed within the mud tiger, for those whose tombstones have not yet been finalised.

Cuban officials arrested a contractor of the US Government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government distributing mobile and laptop computers in the country, claimed the Saturday officials of the State Department.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, work for Development Alternatives Inc, with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients and the Agency for International Development of the United States and the World Bank.
Consular officers, together with the United States interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be detained by almost anything which is deemed "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and writings critics, entails the risk of arrest.
The Chinese-language Graffitti government and the speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent blogger community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, which often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a rapprochement "slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to give the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile telephones and laptop computers are legal in Cuba, though new products and valued in a country where the average salary of a worker in the government is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban Government attached to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in any establishment of the government, as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
The access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Berbena glory, official press in the US interests Section in Havana, said that the bulk of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly desacertados.
An activity in any other open society would be legal, as mobile distributed free of charge, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the programme of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, very Cuba," a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace their ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and detained in a day.
Stated that any solution would probably be policy, and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials desenmarañan a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralizaron the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to lace five men of Virginia North Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they expect the case can help unravelling an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, which moves the Internet in search of radicalised young people.
Researchers said that they were pursuing an insurgent mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan then discover that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the website YouTube videos on the Internet.
Saifullah addressed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them to achieve the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a place relative to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, expressed the Saturday that Saifullah could not persuade the commanders of Al Qaeda that men were not part of a plot of the CIA for infiltrar was in the terrorist network.
Consequently, they are isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha tough, far from the mountains of the West, which has become a terrorist haven.
They are considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men are not inmutaron and even were trying to achieve the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when the police arrested the Pakistani authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underlines the critical role of the recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has emerged as the main priority to try to infiltrar people within al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as Rangers, not leaving move those who do not show a serious commitment of the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that Al Qaeda reviews with special attention to the American recruits aspirants.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, owing to its potential to have access to American objectives and due to its value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the foundation NEFA based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their methods of recruitment.
If you are trying to infiltrar someone in these groups, and what better way to follow the model of recruitment which many have already followed? Kohlmann insights.
It has become a model based much more on the web.
Tens of thousands are protesting in Copenhagen, demand "action" climate
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here by the streets demanding the negotiators who work in the centre of the conventions beautiful center of the city, bold actions for the climate.
The demonstrators were told that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of activists masked placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day in which little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists have walked the city sustaining banners in English saying "no one planet B" and a Spanish declared that "the land says' enough '.
Some famous joined the protest, even the Danish model and fotógrafa Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the homeland of his mother, I became aware of the distressing issues with which the country must contend due to the impacts of climate change are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to submit a fair agreement, ambitious and binding, expressed.
This is not an easy task, but it has to do, there is no way to avoid any longer.
The police prevented demonstrators edge too at the beautiful center, and said that he had been arrested on 19 people, mainly as a result of the use of masks or carrying of pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, which requested not to be identified to be involved in the discussions on the climate, some activists with masks sports and atuendos blacks laid several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were for the buildings, he said, adding that began as llamaradas, but which were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Within the centre of conventions, the people met around television screens to look at the March throughout the afternoon.
But the protest not seemed to penetrate the awareness of key officials as its Wei, chief negotiator of China on climate.
When asked if I thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact in international deliberations, replied in English, "was not really aware of the situation.
Then followed by saying in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is large, I cannot hear what happens outside."
He said that depended on the prospect of each define if the motion was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
Moreover, "one could also say that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data of a test reveal persistent racial differences
The Federal end-of-year ratings of last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools in the capital district.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that pupils of fourth and eighth degree gave strides at a faster pace during the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the recent figures from the national assessment of educational progress is the persistent difference in performance between thousand students and white students, both at local and at national level.
The average score of pupils targets of the fourth degree of the D.C. during the past two years, grew from 262 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers in America rose only three points, 209 to 212.
In reality, the difference in performance grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans from the eighth degree remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant, 245 to 244.
The average score of Whites were not included in the results of the test, because the size of the sample was not quite large.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is not more encouraging.
The gap that separated pupils white and black fourth degree in 2003, when it published the first ENPE in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the score achievements for children in both groups have increased during this period, the gap has barely reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the District expressed concern last week, since the advances concluded by the rector Michelle A. The Rhee and the Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven in large part by white students, which are already very good pupils.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole according to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, expressed Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization which advocates the educational equity in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy at a difference of two or three points, said the Member of the Council of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Association for accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary Eaton.
Brown, an avid critic of the style of administration of Rhee, said that the message of the surveys of the test is that secondary schools of the city have a desperate need attention.
Clearly there is always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what we are devoting neither the time nor the energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to find better ways of addressing the needs of students from low performance.
This autumn, for example, is to train teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, aimed at students in the higher grades of primary school and media, which dominated the fundamentals of reading in their early school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced in the District under the former superintendente Clifford Janey, which is attested something of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
Just think that we must continue working to offer the best speeches to those students who are below the level of degree, expressed Rhee.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlighted the issue of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and thereby provide extra money and resources for schools of low performance, it will be necessary to reduce the difference.
There is a sort of challenging dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley studies, surveys of urban tests.
The solution of the conventional policy is to devote their resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate negative political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other superintendentes urban, it comes to hold it to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools barriales, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access a public education.
Janey, now superintendente schools of Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the difference in performance is extending the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
We must get nearly 200 days to have the strength of the change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the Union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which considers as a "scoreboard" to seek a greater increase in the next Convention.

The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resuello.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a time before the white columns, the façade of brick and meadows Esmeralda.
The parents of Graciela hardly had graduated in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, never had put a foot in a campus.
Yet, when she and the other pupils of eighth degree of the group explored Gettysburg, where the enrolment costs 38,690 dollars per year, its attitude was less the guests impressed that the enthusiasts potential students.
Yes! long here is where I shall be! she exclaimed Graciela, whom I would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
This speaks volumes of how seriously?, said anxiously, when the guide spoke of the low proportion profesor-estudiantes of school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on its journey of three days, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: the question is not whether you to go to university.
The question is to what.
Although there is increasing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic migrants leave secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands acceding to university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanics' second generation 'is gradúa at the University, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, above all Mexicans and Central America, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Their success stories are important, claim researchers, because they indicate the way to a generation which will play a major role in the labour force of the country.
Those who study the higher yield say that often have a natural affinity for school and an inborn tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the grown programmes can also play a unique role to help Graciela and millions of children as she to reach the university, in particular if the efforts they argue over time.
Watching children from low-income families, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help to navigate through the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve everything, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin student.
We must think in providing a network of support for these children, from the Garden of child until secondary school.
The Federal programme which funded the tour by universities in Graciela is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than USD 300 million per year to local school systems, to implement the programmes of preparation, which start when university students from low-income families are in the middle school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent frecuentando the university, according to the Department of Education of the United States.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, for two auctions which concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Ministry of Iraqi oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, irreversibly by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are fainter having pujado in only two of the 10 auctioning deposits.
Seven US airlines had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only that presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for auctioning finds in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq Vajpayee analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of news online.
Long before that something more is on offer in Iraq.
The concerns for the safety, accentuated by bombing mass coordinated on Tuesday, and political instability while the American military are withdrawn, probably prevented American oil companies to risk being more vigorously in Iraq, which is the third most important reserve of crude oil in the world, claimed analysts.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, in particular, Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, labour costs are considerably lower and are more inclined to take risks because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western petroleum Inc were the only American companies which reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have closer ties with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies shining LukOil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The national oil corporation, the property of the Chinese state, ofertó in contracts than any other company and achieved major investments in contracts for two main fields.
We know that China is on its way to become a major economic power and technology, expressed the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We have confidence in the company China will be the couple of their competitors and fulfil its commitments towards Iraq.
The shortlist companies to submit proposals made offers which were then eye with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was prepared to pay for the increased production above current levels in each site.
The main planner of Al Qaeda has been, apparently, murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged attack on the US missile at the border from Pakistan to Afghanistan has killed a main planner of operations of Al Qaeda this week, said on Friday, the officials of the counter-terrorism Americans.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leader of high rank this autumn.
Al-Somalí Saleh was one of the two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday, when a couple of missiles hit his car near the town of watching the Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials from the region.
The local authorities reported that the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the sort operated by the CIA in the tribal areas of Pakistan.
They were driving a car White, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said a servant of the civil intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking on the telephone from watching the Shah.
The official said that the local militants suspected to be rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what became of the "bodies completely wrecked."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two officials of the American counter-terrorism cited evidence does not specified that Somali was among the dead.
It described Somali as a high-ranking military planner of Al Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the region of Afganistán-Pakistán.
It devoted to collude throughout the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes within the Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspirativos attacks against the United States and Europe.
It had a strategic guidance of the top leadership of Al Qaeda and translated into operational standards for potential terrorist attacks.
The second official told us that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of Al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
May not be a name known for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat that we proposed to us and to our allies, said the second official.
If it is confirmed his death, Somali would be the second leader of Al Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking officers.
The pace of the attacks of aircraft pilotados not run by the CIA has declined since the summer, an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a recount of the Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organisation.
The decrease is perhaps a tactic improved by terrorist groups, who have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while murder in ruthlessly suspected informers, said the site.
The maximum envoy of the UN in Kabul to surrender
The maximum UN envoy for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday to give up his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate which was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that supports the increase, but is concerned that the American timetable for the military withdrawal which starts in 18 months to encourage other governments of NATO to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghan people so that they can rely on the international community, signalled Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who cooperate with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, said.
Eide said that he was resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise that he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said that wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, expressed Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a vacuum of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to officials of the UN.
The officials say that they have been given to Staffan di Mistura, a citizen sueco-italiano recently addressed to the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman previously conducted peace missions of the UN.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, what charged in September to favour the President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote in the country and cover evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide refused the incriminations, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was sacked, surely hampered the mission, because it was already much scepticism about the international interference in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a high representative to coordinate the efforts of civil assistance by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
Also pushed the leadership of the UN to allow his successor employ more staff of the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, claiming that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of the UN undermine their ability to attract talents.
This is so that the rules of the UN enabled me to recruit only to a person since May, expressed.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions against Iran, by their failure in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, directing it to a group of approximately 300 American troops in the north of Iraq, during a journey of a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, I played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that worries me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq during the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of targeted sanctions against the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates stated that certain sanctions could also affect the Iranian public in general.
It argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian Government that they would actually less safe with nuclear weapons," because "its people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
Friday, in a statement of the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear programme does not fully respects the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated back to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and agree to make a substantial part of its reservation of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for this agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have been removed from the tentative agreements, in part, the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided in connection with the possibility of committing it with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that the tightening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that in reality accepted at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way in which they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, expressed gates.
President Obama has set as the deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, prior to revisit this other options, even continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "sanctions devastating."
In a statement made in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what it called on Thursday 'unfounded accusations and devoid of basis, "on the part of some Members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it has the will to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers," in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term.
Gates, which was to return to Washington on Friday last, it found in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying in the Kurdish region of Iraq's oil wealth, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high among the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in the projects of the United States, in order to reduce the number of American troops from 115 000 to 50 000 towards the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate the Kurdish anxiety about the reduction pending, American officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani, the chairman of the regional government of the Kurdistan: 'sustain its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Not abandon ".
In a China that ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters that the sermoneaban on the fact that "the mother earth is too tired to underpin more children" and "baby more means a grave."
The lesson learned as well that, when officials of the government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of their city, changed tack suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more of a child, their reaction was snapshot and firm: in any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We do not have anything to a second, said Wang, of 31 years, an administrator of human resources with a child of eight months.
More than 30 years after that included the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children rechonchos notoriously, children only malcriados, kindly apodados "small" emperors, there is a demographic crisis in the country.
The average rate of birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the division
The UN population, while it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more explosions of 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 by 31.1 per cent for 2050. This is well above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with populations of highly educated, like Shanghai.
Last year, the people of 60 years and more accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less of a child by partner.
Lingli Xie, director of the Commission of family planning and population of Shanghai municipality, has said that the infertile couples must have babies to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate future shortage of labour. "
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the one-child policy of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate until the date introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face enormous fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have approved the policy for their contribution to avoid a critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have obliged to pregnant women with a second child to subject it to abortions.
Moreover, many couples have abortions according to the sex of the foetus, leading to a high innatural proportion varón-mujer.
In recent years, the demographic officials have gradually ablandado its position on the policy of child only.
In 2004, allowing more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and wife are children only, and in 2007 atenuaron many of its hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the demographic research institute of the University of Beijing, said that the officials of the central government have been discussed recently even more radical changes, as enabling couples to have two children if one of the spouses is son only.
In July, Shanghai became the first city China in launching an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, posters that ordenaban families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations that detailing who would be appropriate to have a second child and request a permit.
The government of the city sent to officials of family planning and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and drift brochures below the doors.
He has also promised to provide financial and emotional guidance to those who have chosen to have more of a child.
Officials of family planning say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although the officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that revealed a moderate increase in the applications of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000, for example, is still receiving only four to five calls per month.
The disappointed officials of Shanghai say that, despite the campaign, it is expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reach around 165,000,ligeramente than 2009, but less than in 2008.
Juying Feng, head of the Committee of family planning of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give him the best for their first child, said.
Jiawei Yang, of 27 years, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that I would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But as many Chinese, have only the medical insurance and inadequate life which provides them with the government.
Without a network of social protection, argue, this option would be irresponsible.
The people in the West is incorrectly the policy of child only as a matter of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child of the partner.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having a child.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
Is the money.
Other partners cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the administrator of human resources, said that he wants a son only because she was also: "We were at the centre of our families and were cared accustomed to all of us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and we do not really want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years, the owner of an agency of translations, as explained in the strongest possible terms.
For parents with two careers, middle class, to reduce the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success as to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew seeing the fight of their parents during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, expressed.
Even a single child requires a long time of parents, argued.
A mother must abandon at least two years of its social life.
Then there are the issues of space, "must reshape his apartment," and the "strategic must have a curriculum vitae prepared for the best crèches when the child has 9 months."
The majority of their friends are prepared to face this once told Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, expressed.
We do not want to do too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, characterised until now by offensive positions and name-calling, caught a renewed attention on Friday with the dissemination of a document which provides ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialised nations who carry on your shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the path to follow.
But it is seen as an important step in a negotiation which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders who arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would give the rich countries to the poor to confront this global warming in the short and long term.
And that offers a range of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and the main emerging economies recortarían its production of coal, and what would be the limit of the increase of the global temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, he said John Coequyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, which drafted the document of six pages, summarised a text of negotiation of 180 pages to concentrate on what is the highest official of the UN climate, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations recortarían collectively their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45%, compared with the 1990 levels, while the main developing countries reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries recortarían emissions between 50 and a 95 per cent for 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide 3.6 billion dollars per year over the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt it to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts until deforestation.
Anyway, the Friday presented the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the discussions last week.
The special climate envoy Todd Stern, the United States, rejected the assertions that apply compulsory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the industrialized countries, in comparison with the volunteers from the emerging economies, if they are not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials only two years.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the main in developing countries and further action, expressed Stern, who also regretted the fact that the text did not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made their comments an hour after the brought Chinese Foreign Minister Yafei, I said that the maximum climate negotiator of United States lacked "common sense," or "was" very irresponsible for having said earlier in the week that the United States does not help China economically to face it with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major powers of the world at stake, the fault lines have done eruption both within the developing world, as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is to save the individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States are confronted on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four countries of the world are ignoring the most influential scientific imperative to take action more courageous.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should defray the expenses for limiting greenhouse gases, even when the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where it is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for international conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants show that the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, drew up a preliminary draft Treaty of 24 pages early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, which heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process, partly because they are now unified and demand the action of the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took a new urgency while the delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve the majority of exceptional issues before the Heads of Government will reach clinch a deal.
The high-level officials, as the Minister of environment Jairam Ramesh brought the Indian and Chinese Minister, dropped by aircraft and ran towards the corridors of the beautiful center, at meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to delimit the claims that it arbitrarán during the next week.
The complete disarray of the meeting (+donde every day 13,000 people entering and leaving the centre of Convention, activists guitarra touch the present nocturnal spectacles of circumventing the countries as they are selling preliminary proposals, and they go hand in hand rather than via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: almost all key ministers are here at this moment, and Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for the global policy of international conservation.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh of Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
5.13 the Monday morning, a trial whistle perforará darkness to point out an outflow of train marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first InterCity train high speed of the country will reach 225 kmh, when they come as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of transportation, he then hook the lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first service Javelin intercity outside London.
He hopes that the new service links finally Britain at an international network of fast, reliable and trains connecting the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The sloppy remote areas become prosperous suburbs, business travel times are acortarían and the change of aircraft and cars to rail reduce emissions of national coal, as well as aliviarían congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the battle inevitable planning and the fears about environmental damage, can stop even the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, presented his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to learn the times.
This would provide a detailed road map of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line between London to the West Midlands will be determined within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will draw within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
It is also expected that HS2 establishes three options for a high-speed network wider turn to the north.
Lord Adonis respond in the spring.
The favoured option which is being proposed is a configuration with way, and in which a single line of high-speed reach the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with a branch to be directed towards the West from the Peninos until Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the north-east until Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle has Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
“Parece that this will be the most beneficial, "said one Member of the railways.
Once completed, travelling times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which is not usher before 2025, allowing passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, in comparison with the little more than an hour.
The proposals would enable trains travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network in the most rapid in Europe.
The initial path is designed to withstand trains of 400 MT of longitude, capable of carrying 1.1 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of Londres-Birmingham.
This means that we need a terminal in London capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions of area of the capital, are expected to be extended an existing station to adapt it to the high-speed network.
The experts of the rail industry argue that only the station St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced if it believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that they do not take a final decision until after a general election.
Even if launches the labour, the network should be built in sections.
The principle is to compel trains to leave the swift lines by the existing lanes in the north of Birmingham, maintaining travelling times between London and Scotland above the three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to secure a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railways revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage by a naranjal of £75,000 of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the Speaker of the Conservative Party, he claimed to the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a naranjal which built in the House of their constituency.

Allowed him to burdening the tax-payer supplementary interest, aligning hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities in the House of Commons passed the requests in its time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who leads a review of the expenses of Members. Last night Mr Duncan said that the applications “no could be clearer and simpler ".
Mr Duncan, one of the Members of Parliament richer, possesses a House of two apartments in a village in her constituency in Rutland Melton PPPs.
The neighbouring houses have been sold by almost a million pounds.
The plant lower comprises a kitchen and dining room, room to be, but the office of fees agreed with that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year added a greenhouse at home, described in the blueprints as a "naranjal".
The neighbours as described as “un for entertainment greenhouse ".
He asked Mr Duncan to make any reference to the increase of the loan, during a recent investigation of the committee on standards and privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the Committee is acquitted of violating the rules, following an investigation of their expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a loan of 271,406 pounds of his property from London to the House of their constituency, which had bought in 1991, the previous year to turn it into a Member.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr Duncan was requesting approximately £1.4 monthly mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications rose to over £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland of Mr Duncan not changed in that time, suggesting that the increase was to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage type of cooperation from the 7.94% in December 2007, at 4% in March of this year, type is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan remained requesting £1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as President of the opposition in the House in September, after a covert reporter recordings as saying that the Members had to survive “de rations "after the scandal of expenditure.

He added: “no is evade and crime or infrinjir rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be any clearer or more simple. "

As we know, have no right to use the abbreviation, explains the office of the UDF requiring that the "NC withdraw immediately the mention of the name of the UDF all support, and also (a) website".
Also calls upon Hervé de Charette "transferred ownership of (the) marks the legitimate isn't clear".
Not to do so, to invoke the justice in order to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends" elected "go it in 2007" to create a new party, as they had done other in 2002 to create the UMP ".
Therefore, the new centre is not, according to them, no right to use the abbreviation UDF.
Also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged to defend the material and moral interests of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Mr Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, "when recorded the mark," was no longer "Member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
It seizes scandalously rigged and the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to make it for its consideration.
This indiscretion is changing in crime, report, before flouting of the strategy of the NC: "We believe in politics, as in life, it is worthy to make their own behalf to try to get out of the anonymity of fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged by abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Nanterre tribunal decided to put on trial at the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as stated in the daughter of the Liliane multi-million-euro Bettencourt, took advantage of the weakness of the octogenaria to despoil the part of his fortune.
The photographer 62 years, known for their photos of stars of the spectacle, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists in a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and fine 375,000 EUR.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, where the mother and daughter contesting the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the Court corrections no 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, were subjected to a medical examination in charge of three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday to deliver a report before 10 March 2010 in which must record if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during the periods.
I believe that accept.
I shall speak with her, declared the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased by the decision of the Court.
It is an excellent news (…) explosives, show that he (Banier) rigged this old lady, whom we must protect, said.
For two years, the daughter only of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multi-faceted artist, accusing it of having been taken over the years of the weakness of their mother to obtain billion euros in donations, through cheques, contracts of life insurance or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom considers a long-standing friend.
Friday, while the Court investigated the origin of the action interpuesta by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the allegations of lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his clienta send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) at its notary in which said that little faith in the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of the year 2003, Liliane Bettencourt agregaba, according to the lawyer: "you could explain my daughter, he wrote to Banier between one and two times per day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, ever more able to return to talk with Françoise ".
For its part, the office of Nanterre considered, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, both as a judge of tutelas refused, in recent days, to take place at their request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the justice, not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No other person could appear in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided to counsel once made the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Does managerial revolution or end of the intelligence of business?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our fight for the development of the intelligence of business will have been in vano…
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of the marketing: it is that the collaborators join 'values' certain from above as before it was imposed on the consumer products designed for the technical factory.
To put the client in the centre of the company, the revolution of the marketing gave its place in the strategies of conquest of the markets — although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no connection with the factors of preference for customers recurs regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon which affects particularly the executives.
This demobilization severely compromises the development of all the functions of the company, especially of the I+D and, even more, the intelligence of business.
Indeed, Bi (business intelligence) 'demands that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive behaviour and a forward-looking vision "; it needs on the part of employees a compromise that is utterly opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we invited a managerial revolution, which would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company like the customer.
Opinion polls have a relative utility internal
The opinion polls internally, as the questionnaire made by Orange among their employees, will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
In principle, because I was able to check that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what we always B989!
- secondly, because the authoritarianism, one of the failings of the power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- lastly, because the majority of managers have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
As from the major schools of engineers, interpret the psychology of mechanistic fashion.
Take, for comfort intellectual, the former behavioral theory that the "us" neurosciences reactivaron recently, and that the institutes of studies and media widely reported on their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commandos" (sic) of the commitment of the executive, a recent research of ipsos published in Le Figaro. FR reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanistic management unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, mean adopting an end-of-pipe vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into all reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, the compromise with the company is possible only if it emerges quite clearly as a means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the analysis Motifuncional take this conception of the motivations of employees.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based in a doxa predetermined, which allows, through the image of the company, to assess what is offered to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of the factors of mobilization, managers of companies can control, forecast and anticipate its "" social performance radicalization and the management derecursos human "in the place."
In this way, create a favourable ground for the development of an organised business intelligence strong and effective.
Oslo speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise of the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had said on Thursday.
The Conservatives, that had discredited the delivery of the prize Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the Vice-Presidency during the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party to the newspaper used today, and added that she had addressed the issue of the war 'sometimes necessary "in his memoirs recently published.
In my opinion, the war is, of course, the last thing that Americans want to see is obliged to do, but it is necessary.
To stop the terrorists, observed.
Obama, which inherited the two wars of your predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, he did this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the recourse to force, a way to explain their decision to send 30 000 soldiers in Afghanistan nine days before.
Another adversary Newt Gingrich, Obama, considered that the President had done a very good job "in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, it welcomed the former President of the House of Representatives, which transpired in particular mention of "the existence of evil in the world ” in the presidential words.
For the moment, the speech I found very historic, declared Gingrich, during an interview in the radio programme Takeaway "the".
The former representative elected, that some regarded as a potential candidate to the Republican nomination for the presidential elections in 2012, was pleased to listen to a "President of the left" when reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free nor could deliver a prize of peace if the resort to force does not exist ”.
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current cronista in the Washington Post, Obama delivered a speech very American ".
In addition to present themselves as "a citizen of the world", as it always does, "" spoke as an American President "to remind the Europeans' living in a bubble of security that they created and which do much to preserve," said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk of the era of Bush, the former ambassador in the UN, John Bolton, described the speech of "monotonous, patronising and lacks inspiration" in the website national review online.
On the left of the President, the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify the recourse to force.
When covering the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, warned.
However, the press centre left preached to the President.
Los Angeles time, though still believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely described his speech "over-production" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide the international decisions in the fight against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," commented excited the newspaper Californian.
Obama "delivered the speech which was considered necessary," the New York Times, judging the "at the time of bleak and inspirational".
Transport carretero: three negotiations maratónicas to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of maratónicas negotiations, the trade unions in the sector of roads and transport and logistics TLF (France), the only organisation employers who stayed until the end, arrived on the Friday afternoon to an agreement which puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat that rests on the supply of Christmas.
During the session of signatures on the evening of Friday, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "" was pleased by the agreement, then a number of negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were dismissed at the dawn of the Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even when three employer organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) were withdrawn by a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began to the 11 H was necessary for all will agree, and the text is firm in the 18 h.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for companies" and "was feared that disrupt the end of year holidays," declared Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% in the lowest salaries (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The rate per hour climb of 8.72 euros 9.06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we started with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (Fo).
If so, I shall give the order to our militants, that there will be no further cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some discontented rebel, added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that it is "a good agreement", although it was difficult to grant "increases to higher wages, bearing in mind the international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and which respects the employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) was acknowledged as a historic agreement. "
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an acceptable compromise. "
Furthermore, the agreement provides an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of General Assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will primarily address the issue of an extraordinary pays and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a low of EUR 100 million in the employer burdens" was the subject of an amendment of the government in the draft law of finances of correction for 2009, the National Assembly voted on the evening of Thursday.
The government sought to the Senate that the vote "under the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement is implemented, firstly, for companies to this organization and, secondly, the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of work to do an extension.
It will be "with the aliens" Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR complained that it was a "business naive," because the EUR 100 million "had already been pledged to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate an urgent situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to frustrate those who want to eat Turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner, one mourned the UNOSTRA.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.
RER: conflicts over the weekend, trade unions, the proposals of the RATP
The conflicts in the RER, the largest urban public transport of France, will continue during the weekend, because in the meeting on Friday, 2nd strike between unions and the direction of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to your request of premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday trains will only be circulated among the 10 H and 20 H, by reason of a train of every two in the central section (between the Défense and nation) and a train of four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Préfecture Nanterre, which will force passengers to change train.
The terraces Lafayette, they expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy that "the RATP struggle to provide service to the large tents."
The RER in crossing of West to the Paris city.
The stretch RATP haunts since Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre until Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in every two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost any train in hours Valley, as had been planned.
Thursday was not mayhem in the lengthened thanks to the organisation of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at the dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer of 29 years, explained that it had lifted "an hour and a half earlier to reach timetable".
The station Saint-Lazare is not saturó, indicated the SNCF, which had anticipated the supervision of police and police forces.
The RER operates at the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or destination on this arrived or based on the station Saint-Lazare to join the metres.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Will analyse the results, 'unsatisfactory' according to the trade unions, a meeting was held with the direction of the Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who claim a premium that they must, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP puts even in parenthesis its proposed premium, commented outraged the CGT, pointing out that the direction "was not capable of solving a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
It provides a new meeting on Monday for "a more extensive analysis on the conditions for the exercise of the profession," pointed the RATP.
It also led to the trade unions to say that the company "not cared for users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters, in Paris.
Then the direction, which refused until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to appease the waters".
The conflict could be extended to the RER B on Tuesday, after the UNSA and Indépendants have presented a notice.
The unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (UNSA) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variables (CGT, CFDT, FO, SUD, Indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers per day.
Drivers of RER, all in the second degree of his career, charge of EUR 2.2 2.7 in 2000 and EUR 600 to 650 premiums, with alternados, Sunday Times hours and days feriados.
The Turkish justice dissolving the party prokurdo, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the main party prokurdo of the country, a decision which immediately led to manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which has just lending a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the focus of activities that perjudicaban the independence of the state and its indivisible unit ", declared to the press by the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although it only needed a majority of seven votes for the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its President won through violence and the Member Aysel Tugluk are paragraphs of political life for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the assets of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP account with 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members abandoning the Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision stems from a procedure that launched the prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP to obey the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party ensures that there is no 'organic' links with the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organisation, and invites the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time in which the government is tending a hand to the Kurdish community proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thereby put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öçalan, degenerated into clashes with the police during the last few weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered off the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great town of south-east populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces of order threw grenades lacrimógenas and used water cannon, while the demonstrators throwing Molotov bombs or stones with deep.
In Istanbul, also concentrated around 100 people.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of the justice was to deepen the despondency. "
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurd, NDLR) dissolving a party, stated to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closing of parties.
This does not solve anything, declared the Minister of energy, Yildiz Taner.
This decision boycotted by the democratic opening launched by the government, said the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK award is an attack on the seven soldiers who died three days before in the north of Turkey, one of the most murderous attacks of recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to the Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a website for the heavily custodiado secret investigation of armaments.
Today, the Community of 216 000 inhabitants, situated to 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Silicon Valley Russian".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the seat of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the centre of innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were various mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "protocol of close collaboration".
The Vice-alcalde JURI Moscow Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, spearheaded the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of services of Schwarz Edwin planning.
In the 2010 travelling at a seminar in Selenogrado FIZ representatives and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility of putting a foot in the Russian market growing.
In exchange for Russian scientific companies to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of major companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The Community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist" city of planning for the investigation of armaments.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "green city") received her name from the landscape of woodland mountains, in which settled research facilities.
Of Stuttgart brakes
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not sufficiently high places for nothing.
For the supporters of the project is pure and simple of "the new heart of Europe".
The law on the. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which plunged the capital of the region of Banden-Württemberga a decade of chaos irredeemable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with riel, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at that time fossils of engineering of the nineteenth century, who acted as obstacles of a modern rail traffic, which was formerly required an enormous amount of time to integrate back locomotives forward.
Rolling, stopped in its tracks to continue the journey; but it must do it.
And that is why they should disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station of step, which is approximately half of the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The S21 really be initiated, despite the visions of the 1980s will no longer be more compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the capitals hessiana and Bavarian is almost unaffordable to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals, of course, have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with unity tractora and board of the driver in both extremes.
However, Stuttgart 21, including the new tranche built towards Ulm ice will be initiated.
The federal and municipal politicians have prepared.
The rail continues, also because the risks of large individual projects in the infrastructure of the Republic of the taxpayer and not the state.
From the point of view of houses, the project is justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, many green areas, probably the graphic generated by computer of the designer.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station step and the road support are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time is not gave the competition from low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first address to strengthen the transport of goods, since the transport by rail is considerably more ecological accomplished by lorries on the roads.
However, the new tranches in construction we are good for freight trains due to the intensive gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other projects of railways.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zuavos.
That is the official figure.
Experts estimate that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen thousand million.
It is certain that in the next decade the money shortage in other crosses and close passages in the network.
In total sixty bigger projects are on the list of the Ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres long riel through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 is built the route to move slowly.
It would be urgent here moved up a gear as it is due.
Yet the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the autonomous Parliament Wiesbaden, if you are going to present an appeal before the judgment on the prohibition of night flights of the Administrative Court of Hesse.
The coalition of CDU / FDP seems to have commissioned experts to the legal investigation of the judgment of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The Administrative Court in Kassel had informed in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway north-west planned at the airport in Frankfurt, the federated state would have to regulate the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided for the Federal Government, would not be compatible with the legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it is going to present the appeal against this judgement.
The opposition criticised this postponement and lobbied the government representatives for refusing to appeal before the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the Group of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of the prohibition of night air traffic, which had made before the elections; otherwise it could be taken as a lack of word.
It is rather difficult, if you leave keep their word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring it to the slogan of the FDP "we keep our word".
The Minister Posch rejected the reproach of Schäfer-Gümbel, that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentation of the right and tricks yet obtain their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research need some time.
The coalition would not act on the basis of a "first impression fast.
We need a decision legally unimpeachable, said de Esteban Müller (FDP).
As represents the opposition, would not have been before the assertions of his group on the prohibition of night air traffic.
The banks of EE.UU. returned the subsidies given.
The big American banks stricken by the crisis are going back from its shackles.
The Bank of America's "returned only once the aid that he had given the bank rescue fund TARP out of a total of 45 million (approximately 30 billion).
And also the Group Citi plans to restore state subsidies, according to a report from the CNBC from the United States.
With the institutes that seek to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money, as for example the limitation on the payment of the bonus directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had managed to approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the very box, which had enough means, among others by the sale of rubros.
The Director of banking Kenneth Lewis welcomed the Wednesday evening especially American taxpayers: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking House had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Group Citi also seeks to get money in the capital market to free itself from its obligations towards the State.
The CNBC reported source of well-known circles that the American Bank could announce already for this Thursday, the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Group Citi did not want to make comments.
In June had already returned to their aid, JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Rapid Election
In the end everything was faster than was thought.
Barely two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) and the head of wording Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was a confirmation of this part of the station, officially not to anticipate it to the procedure.
But surely also had no further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal is not adopted in the administrative board.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, it needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Committee.
The result of the vote was not yet defined at the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven Members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure to Schächter, but a failure to be expected.
For the majority of the Union in the administrative council for weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the head of wording had been organized by the President of the government of Hesse, Mr Roland Koch.
Another mandate declined from the head of drafting prestigious with the argument that, under the leadership of Brender the news of the ZDF have lost rates of hearing.
Until shortly before the elections, there were protests due to this, in which flageló political influence on ZDF.
In the end, until they had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which has come from the Koch as unconstitutional.
But not served for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
Undergraduate policy, education and filología románica.
After worked in the station Südwestfunk "and" in the newspaper 'Frankfurter Rundschau ".
In 1983 was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 rapporteur staff of the head of wording; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning programme "Morgenmagazins" until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint then of the dismissal of Brender, which was elected even this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the magazine 'means Medium Magazin ".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative Council, the President of the government of Renania-Palatinado, explained last week that the Federated States should change the Convention state ZDF in such a way that the proposals of staff of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the fora of control of the ZDF was removed by Beck.
The likely successor of Brender, Mr Peter Frey, it recommended before the administrative Council with a smart move: criticized heavily at the invitation by the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter I could name for the post of head of wording without losing face, as the administrative board they could vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a partisan henchman for years.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allotted of all forms of liberal left.
The preparation of curricula
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the ministers of education and culture of the Federated States finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides reached agreement in trying to improve the conditions of study in the cases and masters degree.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreement was reached on reducing the burden of examinations: basically each module of the race must end with a single examination.
In addition to examine the workload of students, and it wants to guarantee a "real measure and justifiable".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated States commit themselves to establish more flexible rules for careers of structural bachelor and masters degree.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, must no longer exist.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of education and culture and the rectors of universities talk constantly improving the power to make and conclude with a successful career (estudiabilidad).
Now, for the first time we spoke of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "each module ends with a single examination," says in a document of 30 pages, which seeks to regulate partial approval of the curricula.
With the reduction of the burden of examinations' is intended to avoid the development in the wrong direction, which significantly affect the estudiabilidad, as explained by the director of the Council of accreditation, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in a future "estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined thoroughly in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
The courses.
Students have the right to obtain more spaces, enabling and encourage the own initiative. "
These rules valdrían for new careers, but also in the examinación existing careers.
These must be "reacreditar" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all careers.
Those responsible for this would be at the level of the whole country 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Council of accreditation, which was installed by the Länder.
The ministers of education and culture exhortaron Federal States in October influence in such a way in the agencies, that the quantity of raw materials and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools already reached agreement with the ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now Renania-Platinada assured only provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement programmes of grown student and advice, as well as strengthening offices of examinations and the outside world.
The federal state and universities seek to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to Parliament a novel of the law university.
As it should be enough just one examination for the completion of a model of career.
The configuration of the race should be made more flexible, in addition to ensure the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to the Masters degree.
Until the end of next year is intended to examine all the careers of its "estudiabilidad".
This Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed anew on the conditions of study in the federated state.
As part of the praise there was also criticism of the decisions.
In the board at the federal level of the university groups Juso (Young Socialists) seexigía, that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be "behind closed doors" of the Ministers and the university rectors.
Later, after the strikes of education, now students as key involved should be able to say too.
The chairman of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave its support to students: "We need the experience of students," said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers for Education, with which the HRK discussion on a document of reform as a whole.
For the Union of education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the Union requires a legal right for each student with the title of bachelor the possibility of access to a later masters degree.
Moreover, the Federated States must ensure that the current generation of students of bachelor exist in a future sufficient places of study for masters degree with the best possible conditions of study. It reported a Member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The federated States have quecontratar significantly more teachers.
But about greater access to the masters, the Ministers of Education did not comments.
More than a note to the foot about Herta Müller
"enter and exit from Germany is virtually no control," the first line of a poem by the lírico Werner Söllner in fragments of language destabilizing, in which tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany experienced by a dissident, won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the outset as Professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as the reader in publishing a book before a child labor in Frankfurt in 1982.
In Söllner gave several prizes of literature, in 1993 the memorable things lessons or chatter poetry in Frankfurt at the University of Goethe, and since el2002 is Director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror sacrificed their dossiers of Securitate"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which admitted the participation as im in the Romanian secret service Securitate versus colleagues alemanes-rumanos writers, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
The attempts of recruitment had begun slowly, at the beginning of 1971.
"therefore I am someone who is not sufficiently committed against the attempts of provocation of fear of the Securitate", ended Söllner.
Is the lírico Werner Söllner IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, it shakes the literary stage and, in particular, the Community of German authors originally come from Romania for a case which demonstrates the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as you know, until now, is not only the author, but also a victim.
In his dossier im Securitate Walter had played a role, said the scientific literature Michael Markel after the confession Söllner, and stressed the positive influence for him delIM Walter.
I have apologised or defended in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral necessity of making this statement," he said.
The declaration of Söllner in this way and in the face of this public was unexpected, the confession of a ex-disidente and its work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for club-restaurant Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in July in the weekly "old myth", having read your own dossier of 914 pages.
Those concerned will surely have speculated and have known in some cases, what names are hidden behind pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the dossiers Stasi with a procedure controlled in Germany, the treatment with the dossiers of control by the Securitate is still quite diffused.
A clarification was systematically boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the dossiers since then become rather dragged.
Since 2005, there is a law which regulates the administration of the dossiers.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, proof that the influence of members of the former Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a ex-jefe the Securitate of Temesvar spoke of the condecorada fertile ground.
"+Ella has psychosis," in the end interrogated only once.
The shame of the power seemed to be able to show without round in the form of the freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions arise inevitable with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame silent.
Why right now? who caused damage? The reaction calmly the listeners in the face of the confession Söllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this story is governed by the lust of knowledge and not by the allocation of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the labour of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than a simple note in the foot.
The Champions League as Azerbaijan to fill the stomach
When the new trainer of the soccer team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of Orange colour of the supplier of his team, addressed a taxi Mercedes class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a Member of the foreign service elegant clothes were emerging from a very pleasant celebration of Christmas, in which the manufacturer of sports articles have distributed samples.
The man of the characteristic calva had appointed a driver, because we do not yet know the city.
Otherwise, we would have been able to lead the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and nor was drunk joy man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been employed just three days before: "It is true that octavos reached the end of", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni, Romania, “pero cannot leave us blinded by the success: we will have to fight brutally against the fall ".
The "task much more importante“ I hoped the next Sunday, said.
Then, it will be repeated in Mainz the success of the real “clases "in the routine of the league.
And to eliminate the weaknesses that have been shown clearly again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw lots
The octavos the end of the Champions League (IDA parties of the 16/17 and 23-24 February / parties back nine tenths and 16/17 March) sortearán on 18 December in Nyon.
So we remained limited joy at the break-neck entry of the successor of Babbel.
Not only in the alleged saviour, in brief time I had inspired the baffled profis Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to deliver it and a taste for the game.
I went to the players and I said that they had to focus on its strengths, the blockades to be launched, explained the salutary gross souls of his recipe for the success which sounds simple, but with the user Babbel already had no effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, “cuando in football comes a new impetus, sometimes things happen believed that it had not been possible ".
And Sami Khedira, after a break of several weeks due to an injury immediately proceeded to make it in the best local player, thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the “fenómeno "viewed with the proverbial “viento fresh" and the manner of work of the new head: “Él is a man who intervenes at the Fund, and calls for discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And this is what had lacked, obviously, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sporting steering Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all.
Like the gross, also the players and the administrator abstained to overstate the victory against a defence weakened by lack of relay and totally overshot the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had come to the sad wake, gave to think Khedira.
And the director Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached an objective of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to hold in his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters from three months, was due to the events of last week, who returned to update it in the form of a television interview, conveyed just before the start of the game, which had given the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
It had reproached weakness in the direction of the Steering Board, which had decided to change trainer by the pressure of fanatics adolescents.
Also that it had removed its day after the games as Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements of Lehmann were “marcadas by the pure selfishness, "Heldt reinstated, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
It is probably not be friends forever, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others in that, without previous efforts with the team of the trainer replaced, would not have been possible the spectacle of great strength of game and battle.
Babbel and their assistants had “una important participation in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed the man of the suitcase plastic.
Myanmar of the World Cup of heavyweights
An ardent mourning in Berne: again and again the retador Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion of heavyweight.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the partnership WBC expired on the evening of Friday Saturday in Berne at the American Kevin Johnson by a unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 119, 120, 108, 109).
For Klitschko was its third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice WBO world champion of the associations and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the noqueo that everyone had hoped.
Klitschko expanded its stock to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be defeated by due to their injuries.
The retador Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
In the face of 17000 spectators in the sand of Berne, Klitschko, with a stature of 2.02 metres, wanted to dictate the fight above all with the left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimetres low, before the duel had proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was running away again and again of the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not carry decisively in its objective its dangerous good.
In general terms, the liabilities Johnson made too little for a retador, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although it was causing to Klitschko with words and gestures, their coups only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxeador, after pure Hoffmann in the year 2000, which weathered twelve rounds out with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retador had already produced some scandal in the capital Switzerland.
It had insulted Klitschko as “horrible zombie ", which “no knows do nothing".
With the 6, the champion it ceased to provoke the Friday to take him to Johnson glasses of sun nose “para able to see their eyes. "
Fourthly triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also at its fourth row after their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a gap of almost four years, expired at that time to the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained their "" of the WBC belt, which previously had to hand without a fight.
That year expired after their defences of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a coup, and I am very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko their rapid return to the ring.
But their dream remains to gather all four titles in his family.
His brother, Vladimir is a world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after this destronó in November Valujev Moscow, 2.13 metres stature.
In the summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company is planning to promote the fight against Klitschko in the stadium Wembley, London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of opposition: the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called a liar to the Minister of Defence, cut due to false information on the subject Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left demand explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin – after the most recent revelations about the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor cut necessitate (CSU), have deceived with knowledge of the facts.
In the emission of news "Tagesschau" of Saturday conveyed by the ARD television channel, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the Minister “a knowingly had not told the truth "on the murderous bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it usually says: he said lies.

The Greens, the SPD and the left exhortaron Saturday at the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to pronounce it immediately before the Federal Parliament and clarify what actually cut knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of the intentional killing is part of the policy of Afghanistan of the Federal Government, and if the Chancellery, the army and the information service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate outcome.

Worlds oníricos
In a state of vigil, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts are vanishing the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While happening during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are acostados in our rooms dark with our eyes closed, we can deliver us the harshest unimpeded imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, who experiences states like the dream during the vigil, or to see and hear things that others do not see or hear, it considers the majority of modern times in the Western world as insane or drug addict, or at least as maniático.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the addicts.
The blame has our imagination: the same neural plasticity processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make desdibujen the boundaries between the dream, the madness and reality.
The States of conscience oníricamente modified warning may appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases call visions, and at worst madness.
Although it can distinguish the trigger and effects, one can refer to processes such visions of the inspired Hildegard von Bingen experiences psicodélicas of the Prophet of the new era Carlos Castañeda, states in possession chamánica, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when it has descarrillado the balance of the substances neural plasticity of communication in the brain –sobre throughout the dopamina, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetilcolina– and is disrupted the interaction between various parts of the same.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear hallucinations complex and thoughts insane.
The gravity has no power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied to philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle envisaged the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, concluded in 1861 a "great resemblance to the state of madness with States oníricos" to Freud, seemingly the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the absurdity, alocadas formations and mirages of this".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity has no power over him, is floating around the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures demons with wings, with red blood, reshape as deformed, rechinando teeth.
We are pursuing, trample with heavy boots and flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Strident voices and malignant ringing since the walls and the radio.
Can no longer bear them, the voices that affront and insult.
Henning T. extorts two cables of the state, the amarra to form a nucleus of hanged, and sets a ceiling on the hook.
You climb in a bocina and puts the noose around the neck.
Obvious it.
The rope is loose.
Long +Qué will serve as a lesson!, shouting in a chorus of voices that the tímpanos bursts, “ long views the clinic and tells you heal! "
Now, Henning T. has 40 years and has experienced six psychosis acute, the last two years, the first almost 20 years.
The cause that the produced was LSD.
His diagnosis is esquizo-afectiva-paranoide psychosis, is also maniaco-depresivo, medicines, against depression, fad, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with the disease, three years is married.
In the psychosis have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics were treated as the second most frequent disease after the depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time concerned can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of sobreexcitación that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur disorders in the relationship, or way.
Particularly widespread is the hearing voices: voices which give orders, word or dialogue.
They are also frequent the optical hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer percolate signals disruptive, awareness is inundated with impressions.
As the dream, also the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, medical head of the clinic of psychiatry general of the University of Heidelberg hospital.
The schizophrenic lies at the heart of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, feels exhausted by events and not the can organise actively.
That is why the psychoanalysis often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a grim reality, the awakening is impossible.
Having experienced a alucinación once in the life
On the contrary, in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remain in principle as".
The thoughts paranoids and hallucinations rely on the reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers are still guess why our brain makes unfortunate mishaps.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can lead to any person to lose touch with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic provision for the schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to the genes, there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But remains guess how it produces that distortion of the neural system, which, moreover, is manifested in all over many years.
The influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the causing of a psychosis when there is already a prior provision.
In the same way, hallucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis, because they interfere in the system disseminator of the brain.
When the brain warms
The sense of all this is that the people psicóticas experience with their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor in psychology, Erich Kasten Lübeck.
The sense alucinación as a pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten collects ten years reports on hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the book irreale die Welt in unserem Kopf (the world unrealistic in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical flanking symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
These include, together with psychological disorders as the limit of the personality disorder or depression, too often diseases such as tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and injuries craneoencefálicos.
So surprising and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, is composed of memories that normally are repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain that processed perceptions are hiperactivas sensory or are little cohibidas; when our brains are controversial, but also when we lack incentives.
Drugs can cause this rule in the same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of incentives, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis necessitate a Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens, einmal im leben Halluzination Court erlebt haben necessitate.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and flocked to a college of higher education.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and the voices.
Sometimes, during the playground, happens that a clumsy boy with long and dark hair directs him the floor.
When she says, the other pupils at the soprendidos; nobody, part of it, hears or views the boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a little odd, but Sarah K. knows that it is not dreaming.
It is alive and see and hear the boy, in the same way that we see and hear the girl seated in the Bank.
It can feel even its presence, at least some moments.
It is a pleasant feeling, like the boy.
Sometimes wonders whether it is mad.
It also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When it is in class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because Professor – their eyes and ears – is presenting a new colleague, while the rest explains so visible and audible the mathematical equations.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream, which often arrives late and is scarce, not able to tell whether it is alive or dreaming, if the images we see, or the girl to reshape the abysmal cuts in arms and legs, appear to face their eyes open or closed.
Allow me in peace, I cried at the figures.
Their parents and friends are not had nothing, creerían who is insane.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. has hoy20 years.
Adopted last year selectivity and live with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since that has come into contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that it is not insane.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is desocupado yse authorizes the same to be found entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter only, was small fear of the other children and often playing alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, we learned that the man who called father from which has use of the reason is not his biological father.
Since the noise and Visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that they also process real impressions and noise, affected as Sarah K. I find it difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. “Cada experience, "says Kasten, “tiene place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain occurs, why seem very real ".
Kasten also classifies the night fantasies as a form of alucinación.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ in essence of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the psychoanalysis, but healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten recommends therefore their patients who appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
Situation between dream and alucinación limit
In this world too focused on the conscious experiences often imaginary usually patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and doctor head of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a disease hard and painful but that also entails a positive and creative – the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The hallucinations oníricas dreams are almost very detailed and complex that the person experiences considers that the real and subsequently cannot differentiate the rest awake.
The States aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or a disease, as for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía experience a driving paralysis, which remain fully aware. Die EIB vollem Bewusstsein motorische Court Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a permanent and total incapacity reservation, it replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world that is decoupled imaginary and the reality.
A form of situation boundary between dream and alucinación.
It is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink in none of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also, the historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zürich, describes their experiences oníricas in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of rescue of the soul.
It had 49 years ago, when his conscience embarked on journeys of several days after an operation of the heart valves with transplantation of heart included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the station of intensive care.
Claussen is plunging in a world created by the same and visited places strangers in other times: was knees in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorio on a train, a robot protection for their health.
We saw in the high average age, surrounded by noble that produce drugs from blood.
As a Greek Moto on a secuestró in their country of origin, made surf on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and found with a Korean mafia.
It is particularly in these facts imagined, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes as their experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the mental journeys are many years later, much more clear, even in the details irrelevant.
Even more clear and intensive that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience weakened the horizon of the rest of our everyday experience, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile the internal reproduction of the reality outside, even when we are awake.
Each amendment of the state of conscience, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality. '
An experience which, furthermore, may be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Crude
Children take charge of the editorial with 27 years.
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, commented on Spiegel.
100% of the insurance will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg Hubert crude – the publisher sees its company in the hands of their children in the future.
Two children become heirs with 27 years and have the determination to enter the company, confirmed gross, of 69, SPIEGEL.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are able to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 employees to their children, if they are not sufficiently empowered to do so.
That would undermine the children, and also with the company.
Gross published on Thursday, we will withdraw from January the Presidency of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This Member of the family Kallen, 52 is since 1999 Member of the direction of crude.
In a start was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and thereby came the responsibility on the heritage of the company. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of the direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, any Member of the family occupies the apex of the editorial.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently have 42 years, died a few years.
The appointment of Kallen "also serves to bridge the differences of 10, 15 years," according to gross.
100% of the insurance will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, gross stated that family businesses are not immune from the decline: "that has always affected families who will be passed by the pursuit of search of capital, which have judged wrong and thought that they could raise it as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur," says gross.
I do not see it as a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with the “Time "in the world league; these businesses have become too great.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the post, without possibility even see some sort of Deputy or surfing the Internet.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in EE.UU. when the time Magazine named as one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the Peek smartphones, has a very low price and a monthly quota very low, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the plan of data from the iPhone.
Given the success of the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free service of data for life in return for pay six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek presented yesterday in the event, it is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is equally limited than its American counterpart, but comes as a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, approximately 12 per month, includes the roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphones already know what is having to renounce the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a bar with important (or a connection of fon) to consult the post.
The idea of a roaming at fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that we would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience takes a doctorate in order to understand the physical and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated robbery of ears of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming charges throughout Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and with good reason.
A aparatito as FonPeek (not ceases to be curious to carry the name of fon when it lacks important) manages this type of tariffs means that operators are beginning to think differently and study various proposals to pay off their network of data.
Kindle is another good example, includes the trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and without bagpipes.
It is a device attached and pay for it to buy it, not month by month.
And that is what I hope to see some day with FonPeek an option to purchase with access for life as Peek already has in EE.UU.
Not because go to buy it.
I look at my post in the telephone, thank you.
I hope so because I believe that it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The colour of Michelle Fetish
The yellow is, without doubt, the tone preferred of the First Lady.
If we attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the US with a clothing and a coat of this colour, has chosen to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has led a model very similar in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar colour - yellow verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress is composed of three parts - clothing, jacket and shelter of the same question - and adornaba with a great embroidery or restraint.
So much so that, in a first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States remained the slipstream of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the question pertains are in the two costumes makes very different.
If the inauguration of a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with given.
The additions have also changed: shoes Greens of half tacón another time, and a similar model, but in Eldorado, now.
And also differently is the peinado: a put on this occasion, loose manes.
75% of working mothers has had problems for their maternity labor
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study 'fertility and labour trajectory of women in Spain, produced by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers has seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences at the beginning of the coexistence of couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, part-time work, or have a stable work, initiated before the coexistence in partner, pre-empt the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delayed coexistence and motherhood, and have less descendants.
"women between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after opening coexistence, which rises to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time to achieve the vital record, which has led to postpone the Union and the arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of work exerts great influence on motherhood although less about the timing of the pairing-up ", explains the researcher the CSIC Daisy thin.
The level of studies is another factor that difference the age for women to marry and have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the greater is the age to marry and to have the first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which have elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time in the 32.1 25.1 and media respectively.
"itself also establishes another division between women depending on their level of studies.
While they marry elementary studies and have their first child before achieving a stable employment, the average levels or superiors invest this sequence and give priority to the achievement of a stable employment as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child, "detailed thin.
Also worth Diane Kruger
L'Oréal Paris just add a new name to their envidiada list of embajadoras: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress become image of various products in the mid-19th mark the universal slogan "because I valgo".
The major Joyeux Noël ", one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous fichajes of L'Oréal Paris, like Linda Fonda see, mobility, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope cross.
Before that, the last to enter into such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("lost") and Freida Pinto ("slumdog Millonaire").
In paragraph men, make cosmetic also meets with ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey ("Anatomy of grey") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline "lost").
Of the British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of the fashion.
Their highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, which was held in London, in the Royal Court entirely justice.
Because no one to the quotation.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected best model of the year.
The poker Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent "gift poker ace" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vincent) a concrete screenings of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not in the gender predictable and feared (biográfica destroy, life and work), but looking for something like the core of igniting the individual creator.
The journey has its excitaciones and Vicent not saves scares or iluminaciones.
In addition to a fine pleasure, the Paper is a poignant invitation to readings and relecturas.
Here I leave some shots.
On Albert Camus: "in its pages discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a pulsión physical, spiritual, almost the same that I felt without giving the name: the pleasure against the black destination, without guilt and moral innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, Christian alegórico, what was written in the blood, not in the intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a poetic humour dazzling, without sense, as the roadmap that the knife was about to kill him.
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducido by this woman with a passion which lasted for thirteen years, in whose meat conjugó the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse spiritual, a privilege that was to achieve the sky through the path of downfall."
On James Joyce's: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia beach. It is a specialized eight thousand metres from the universal literature, which must be scaled for the wall North, from which it despeñan again and again the best alpinistas."
On William Faulkner: "was a kind rare.
In itself, sometimes said it was a landowner heir of the county and others that he was the son of a dark and a crocodile.
Both were dreams of grandeur. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer received the insane cry launched from a bridge for that person from Munich to carry its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did so in a journey fleeing itself, and invoking posterity with a violent speech at the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "a day was their knees and rezó: 'God wanted, you would do to stop write as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad "on its grave were enshrined these verses of Spenser: 'the dream after the effort, / following the storm on port, / the rest after the war, / after the life extremely pleased death.'
On Virginia Wolf: "in the luggage also means its depression.
The husband accepted quite normal that she said that Eduardo VII the espiaba between the azaleas or birdsong sing in Greek.
It has never been given the case of a man as patient and love of a neurotic literary talent which went ahead of their madness. "
On Pius Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos but try to inoculate to Joyce's in Baroja?
Does +Qué Benet but attempted to turn Baroja by the weapons of Faulkner?
Does +Qué made Cela but abducir the reputation of that man to serve as a very pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression,
Last week, my mother of approximately 70 years of age was by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years went along with it and our dog, a copy of race mixed-blood, net of the perrera and with no more than six kilos in weight, and without a word, I propinaron two kicked that left the malherido dog.
Our indignation is capital because we find the enjoyment in a wanton aggression to an animal small defenceless, incidentally, was tied.
To this we must add the embarrassment that he led to a lady who was quietly and that, when increpó these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a energúmeno attacking an animal, it is able to do so with a woman, a child, an elderly or, in short, with whatever weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday anyone by a district traditionally calm.
The dog was crying all day.
Incidentally, we made a complaint in a nearby police station that doubts that serve much and not to generate sensitivities, just to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider fun maltreating free to a defenseless animal that US gives affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where they have been the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together by the use of the hull
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the hull, mainly among the young motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection able to prevent injury in the head, or even the death in the case of an accident while circulating in motorbike.
Michelin indicated that this campaign forms part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing every day more secure and stated that it also contributes to this goal by other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign of promotion of the use of the hull in motorbike under the slogan 'to be or not to be', will take a first phase in which will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycle, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern "for the company, as being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop a few products increasingly safe.
Climb the sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units which are licensed in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months falls, according to figures from the employers of ANFAC manufacturers and sellers GANVAM.
The right figure, not osbtante, it should be put on hold because the reference to the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a reduction of 60% over the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the upsurge in the last month, the matriculaciones stockpiled in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that compose the mishmash of the light commercial seal: cars, vans, up, not evade the light and heavy lorries / chassis.
Furthermore, they have not disappeared the clouds that most affect their demand, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
So that the restrictions which represents the tap closed of bank lending, must add other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Against this background, and unlike cars, little have served subsidies for the purchase of the 2000E.
To be eligible, moreover, the self-employed individuals and SMEs to go to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been a token gesture.
Yesterday, since GANVAM returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (lorries and buses).
The association of sellers predicted a 2010 similar to the year, for which estimates a fall in sales (cars and 4x4) of 19%.
The aid to the emergency brake is already mandatory
As happened with the anti-blockade ABS brakes and about the control of EPC stability, the systems of aid to the emergency brake will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
Indeed, we are all cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while the rest is set for a period of time until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, on his way to work, it can also help to prevent many collisions by REACH.
The assistant to the emergency brake what is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, that the system detects by the pisotón that gives the driver.
But this does not always maintains that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, the third part of drivers involved in an accident had not come to apply the brake before the collision and half of them do not availed the full force.
Until 1.1 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in turn, requires the maximum in the system of brake, reducing the distance that employs the car in stopping it.
According to a study of the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided in the year until 1.1 fatal accidents involving pedestrians.
The reduction will still be higher - estimates that they avoid one of every four claims with damage to people - when it popularicen the so-called intelligent emergency brake system.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system (through a radar or a house) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, would help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If we do not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum effort on the brakes to minimise the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the employees of the plant of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be launched in the first week of April - the day 8 probably - reports Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
It seeks to Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the aggrieved party.
And this can do that the final document will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, from GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should take in the coming days.
This is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to have contact with some new potential buyers.
One could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength the option of the Dutch producer of cars Skyper sports, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement was reached with none of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to China Baic.
It maintains the decision to close Saab at the end of the year if not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For desarrolar their holidays, and expensive gem, engineers of Porsche took the Boxster S as a basis and ensured that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilograms, which has left the báscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This led to dispense, firstly, the automatic ceiling has been for one of accionamiento with handbook, thereby save 21 kilograms; using gates of aluminium as GT3, "" fall further 15; eliminating the climatizador, 13; reducing the deposit of fuel to 54 64 litres, it won 7 kilos; staging sports bacquets other 12 and with the necessary light 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the system of audio CDR-30 yielded another six kilograms and marksmen changing the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
Although it also offers much change with the double couplings, the test was carried out on a unit with the box handbook of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads in California, in sections of mountains with routes really revirados
Its behaviour can only be described as unimpeachable.
The reduction of weight does not imply that the car pise not the asphalt with poise.
Quite the opposite: not long testábamos a model so small and light, the time, communicated such security in the step by curve, even at higher speeds.
It is a small athlete, capable of heat their muscles in a short March during the necessary time, until he ordenemos that esprinte, slow, recover and return to squeeze its engine...
What I ask you to your direction, such as accurate communications, which indicate with our hands in the wheel is what the car.
And it will do with a surgical precision.
Sound of the engine for will
The sound of its V6 contexts, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system which alters the bramido of the engine, already started before in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or inconvenient.
The asphalt roads risen with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digirió well the potholes.
The electronic aid barely went presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the bends find ice at dawn and gravilla, already well into the future.
In short, a car ultra light, more enjoyable that one can lead in the market, and that is something more than a simple amendment of the São Boxster
The car was put on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
"girl" bag

The Baskonia offered a victory in Israel,
The labour box achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 during his visit to the scope of the complicated Maccabi, despite the numerous casualties which enjoyed the team of Dusko Oliver Ivanovic, and in this way is located in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triples accepting was the best of his team (29 assessment).
The team vitoriano unable to meet the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, vegetable gardens or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end to do it with the victory.
Moreover, the great success since the perimeter, with 16 triples accepting had much to do in the ultimate triumph.
The party started expensive for the Azulgranas, which came from the start ahead in the scoreboard.
The first four canastas of the vitorianos were from the perimeter was already presage who had come to the Israeli room with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of some 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés chose the game of internal Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to the outside their home, to continue expanding its advantage to the rest (34-43).
Teletovic already beginning to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, although the least six "of assessment of Splitter because they presage that would not be in the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being sorted the rest, was not decided far less and macabeos wanted to remind the vitorianos that in its scope cannot win anyone, and with "the hand of Elías" managed to put it in tightening the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" congressmen around the bright (50-49).
Further disadvantages
The Oliver Ivanovic, injured but far fewer deaths, needed hilar a couple of games with wisdom to catch air, and in these came the ametralladora of Mirza Teletovic, with three consecutive triples almost and the help of English and Ribas returning the scoreboard to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to airbrush local people at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaveses came to leave the skin in the last part-session and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already told that they would not allow themselves to withdraw what had been received during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team is not resignaron and tried to keep alive his team from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed by mistakes, of Oliver Ivanovic should not be rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis drew in the minute end (80-85), the party had master and the victory is fleeing Tel Aviv by first in the season.
The injuries prevent give battle to the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost miserably in Greece before the Olympiacos and I gave the leadership of the Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the casualties of the cajistas, especially in the internal game, and Archibald Freeland (Lima), which enabled the Greek victory.
The team malagueño is not fright for the environment of the flag of peace and friendship and not by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed dream the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triples, two of the basis Omar Cook and one blond Guillem, deslumbró local people 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the premises in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave the return to the scoreboard 22-20, minute 13, at the moment, that action, signs of wrangling between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was the disqualification of both players.
The Greek whole began to function showing their superiority in both areas, where the injury caused by the pívot English Mr Freeland and three personal shortcomings of Carlos Jiménez, were lastrando the cajistas.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian umbrella Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible to recover
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, that despite the 19 losses, was superior and even came to match the difference of the disputed meeting in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which was rocked the leadership of the group.
The Unicaja tried to shrug off the absences and to the last drop of the Scottish pívot Robert Archibald, maimed during the meeting.
Despite all the difficulties the Unicaja by the direction and triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when apretaba and given their superiority in centimetres within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pívot Nikola Vujcic managed to overcome the average basket 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja are gone, giving the lead to the Olympiacos.

Brazil puts date to the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has run to the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must abandon the diplomatic legación later on 27 January 2010, when officially completed its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, commissioned of business of the Embassy of Brazil in the capital hondureña, confirmed on TV globe that "Mel" knows that it must leave before that date of the embassy, which remains a refugee from 21 September.
"+Él is aware that it must go on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek other destination."
The station also cited in the former Attorney, who confirmed its intention to emerge from the embassy before the deadline: "the position of mine is out as soon as possible, naturally with the support of the government of Brazil," declared Zelaya telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which the President-designate proved stronger Wolf), Zelaya ensured that stay in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this very week tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the status of political asilado intended to impose the government "de facto" who presides Roberto Micheletti.
Many thank
After the days of wine and roses since the last spring in which the asset inflation has been the dominant pattern in the markets, new uncertainty returns to reoccur in the markets, which is not surprising, because it is their natural state, in an environment in which the actors take decisions on the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise the markets was monetizar debt with direct purchase assets and indirectly by free-for-all liquidity rates close to zero for the financial institutions purchasing assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually ended and, without questioning its policy these liquidity, begin to throw some sand in the wheels how the ECB with its auction in the year of the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy in order to maintain the economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The ever of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonds have returned to repuntar, although still far from the levels paranormales which reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialize risk private and public debt returns to be affected.
There is once again a flight to the quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge elected by investors, causing an extension of the differences in the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of the moral hazard of new office which attempted to create awareness on those responsible for the world economic policy for having slowed the destructive effects arising from the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to issue a new day of action of thanks.
However, the Dubai depicts a tribal struggle between the emirs to reset the power in the Emirates and Greece we have already seen before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that pulling the whistle-blowers.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin salvase Hungary of a breach of their external payments at the beginning of the year and will allow a country Member of the euro fails to meet its commitments.
It is logical that the Ecofin Council has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to lose their citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses in transitional leveraged positions, would be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, while our differences in the public debt extended like the European corporate bonds should not concern us.
If the European differential decline and our still widening, then it would consist of Spanish idiosyncratic risks.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our developed indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate its scenarios of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not spell a life expectancy at its warning.
Again, the pint which will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver."

After his speech, followed by the President of Natural-Fenosa gas, Rafael Villaseca Galán, gave the press with smatterings of what had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion until 2020 and other 60 million between that date and 2030, provided that they are kept open nuclear power plants in operation today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be of 60 million, but until 95 million.

In the expectation that they submit their tenders next May, the planned investment amounting to EUR 1 700 million Australian dollars (1.047 billion) and in the final phase compete three consortia with remarkable presence of European construction.
The group christened Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish in table, and his colleagues are BMD and Ghella.

Against the team of Acciona plays the consortium Northern direct, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke manager of the Australian Transfield infrastructure and the group builder French Bouygues.

The Australian market infrastructure promises great works and privatisations, but entails a clear difficulty of entry if it is not the path of the acquisition of a local signature of construction.
A strategy that have followed these Hochtief or Bilfinger, apart from Asian references, and which remains unresolved for the giants of the Spanish sector.
Barely ACS has achieved a position in that market through their participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets costing millions
Acciona bid for a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, which has already highlighted presence through its activity as a supplier of energy and in the business of the desalación.
Among other assets, with its largest offshore wind park, Waubra (192 MW) in victory, and lead the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing the desaladora of Adelaida, with a budget of ECU 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The path of underground toll, promoted by the Office for infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and so-called northern link (link North), is destined to join the Western Highway Toowong with the path of bypass Kelvin Grove in (see map) over 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The timetable set by the administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the uprooting of works in December next year.
Despite this step of payment will open to the trafficking in recent months in 2014, it is not anticipated that the construction is finished until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
Include two paths for sense, electronic toll system and a complex system of ventilation.

Fine 63 million in France Télécom to curb the competition
The regulator of competition in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom by anti-competitive behaviour regime in the regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competence in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, plans and programmes of loyalty to consumers in the scope of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned accumulates over EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 to gag its competitors.

Play the champions has brought 476.4 millions at the Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for the clubs since we started in 1992.
Therefore, Real Madrid and Barcelona joined 476.4 million since then, what makes them the third and fifth club that more money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is the Manchester United.
The leader of the list is the Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League of UEFA not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 billion to 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since it created the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to data from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have gone well from this division.
The white club has been the third of the continent that more money has been pocketed by participating, and the only, together with the AC, which has won three times the trophy.
Catalan, the current champion and the final winner of the defunct European Championships in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list of leading Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, more money facturaron involved the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both versus Barça.
Moreover, Spain is only the third country that more money has been achieved through the champions, despite having done more than any other titles (five, by four of Italy, three of England and two of Germany).
The distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure for the distribution of money that applies UEFA.
For this exercise, the body which presides over Michel Platini foresees join 1 090 million for the Champions League.
This money UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the previous round of classification (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who managed to participate received only by 3.8 million to be there, in addition to other 550,000 euros for each party that matches.
There are also bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and by empatar (400 000 for each team). The octavofinalistas earn three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four are embolsarán 4 million each.
The champion won 9 million, compared with EUR 5.2 million the practical.
Thus, in the concept of fixed payments, a club accede at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça moreover, it embolsó 2.5 million for winning the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But it is also are variable payments, which are intended 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish Government is the main, and four seats allocated.
The champion of the previous year falls with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part would be paid according to the number of parties that they play in the edition of this year.

New tools for peritar cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only earn the workshops of cars.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are remolcados until a workshop, where a forensic must assess the damage and what will be the cost of repair.
Any sinister is equal, and the calculation of the costs of spare parts and the time of labour can be a long and complicated task.
Calcularmanualmente the cost of compensation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including ymano pieces of labour, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the most recent information tools would be subject deminutos

As a new car goes to the market, these companies are put to work.
It is a very hard work, because we must call each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and introduce its price.
Moreover, each model is making a vivid picture 'intelligent' which can be "pinchar" different parts of tourism.
If it is a model of ventamasiva, the work can be completed in a week if the process is very fast.

The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invested EUR 90 million annually in drafting these databases.
Every month include 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The preparation of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give different uses and offer varied products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries are also tools for management of pieces of scrapping or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide which reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.

The cars with historical value may be high even if they have been given low after a lengthy efforts.
Budget of workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user obtains a budget in only four steps: to identify the vehicle, seek the spare parts, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an enforceable essential for these systems, especially in order to convince the older professionals, to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 todoterrenos, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 lorries.
Of course, it is necessary to use a computer with connection to the Internet.
Once identified the model to repair through a number of bastidor, appears to be a real graphic image of the model in question and, later, you select the parts needed.
The user can include variables as the price of the workforce, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to surrender to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool of assessment as AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between both systems is that the aimed at the workshop does not include estimated times of manpower.
The cost of use of this tool for the workshop is 350 per year, that the customer can finance.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are).
This is an innovation that mechanics view with very good eyes, because it will, for example, to select a door and giving the return to see the internal face.
