That is what will happen? CSSD is neither Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new elected CSSD at the capital's mayoralty will apparently overcome real language barrier to understand the level of the municipal council with their new and old colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has tested the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, whether they are aware of the argôt who was born in recent years at the town hall, when they were partners in the current coalition who led Prague.
The coded language policy cream Prague initiated during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
I was surprised that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known.
The less they say.
"That is" Valdemort.
"I really don't know."
" I am a jeunôt in politics pragoise Lukas Kaucky responded, elected culture test vocabulary of " godfather ."
And with regard to the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole."
"It is the only expression among those you suggest that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Vocabulary, whose Aktualne.cz daily published the expressions in June this year before the pre-éĺectoral Convention of the ODS, drafting chose 6 examples, priority those associated with the mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of " Voldemort ," " the largest hole golf Prague ," go to the patisserie ," " beef nerve, " " betrayal of the capital " and " entôler. "
Three of the elected officials have agreed to the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, which must lead education Prague in the future - has promised firstly an interview but then has not got the telephone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I am not responsible for any of these things lá and how to play the representatives of the civic democracy: I will not give my opinion."
"I am in the process of how we are going to understand in the context of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, Lukas elected Kaucky does not recognize apparently in the legend above, it is the influential Janousek on contractors and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing á' Kaucky and the only expression he has guessed in the test is "the largest hole golf Prague."
"It is the tunnel" Blanka said Kaucky and immediately adds: "but I know the newspapers."
"I am going to have to pay me a language course," jokes does it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but Lukas Plachy, elected to the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks about the meaning of " go to the pastry.
"It is, I think, to go into a business," Plachy is willing to guess that it is the corporate headquarters of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that it derives its knowledge rather newspapers and not some vocabulary that he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no argôt lexicon of in social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we did not really something like this."
"It is quite some time, the names are used abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, that the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this," said Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for members of the party or the least friendly old Petit, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the small joujou."
The nicknames are also the only admit that use inside the party, the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky don't like very much to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for Prague president.
"Doctor baton right" seems recalls that Petr Hulinsky received his doctorate in law JUDr.à the police academy's bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture "witches," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women reported witches have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, may not work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
That becomes "witch" is isolated in order not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Has very rarely destiny."
"We do not consider the young women in good health as they participate in the work and their children," said a sister who is in the capital of this West African nation, Burkina Faso, in a special institution for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this unusual "social measure."
He has published a brochure, which should help limit the witch-hunt.
The case involves a "trick."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the daily Die Standard warned about the problem of education in writing.
The accusations of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and one man and burned with oil they had sprayed.
It is the BBC's server which forwarded this information.
Criminals say that it was bad.
According to their version of the oil used for ritual anointing was emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, apparently, when the team wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a contractor 42 years of Burkina Faso, "the eating of human minds have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch-hunt, Gambia not later than last year even saw the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch-hunt that apparently were involved in his death and would be tried by the black magic to kill the President."
" Shamans of Guinea near came to the rescue, led to the strong presidential Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, men and women randomly selected diferent villages in Gambia, " said in a message, " Amnesty International.

The Bakal tenant: the poèles heat, it signed a higher rent.
An elderly man imposing went out the door of the customer centre of the RPG Byty society "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
It was the case with three new lease contracts for three apartments: hers, his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 son will have to address from next year for a flat 2 + 1 second class 4100 kroons.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," pointing the finger on the new contract to his son, which has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he explains to motié angry and resigned half.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz apartments has described the nouelles rental terms such as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, the date on which will be issued a notice to explain the procedure to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One said, the other says something else" in the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, that is what looked most apartment in the Czech Republic, which rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz was for this reason decided to personally visit the "laboratory."
The waiting room of RPG in the Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 o 'clock in the morning.
Right next door is a company with a device to draw customers.
A special button, "rent" 2011 is lit on the touch screen.
One pressure and a paper with a lot of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that number is already lighting is on the big screen in the topit the waiting room.
In a split second, it is your turn.
After a moment, an old couple comes to inquire about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to be people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - repairs, insurance and other areas.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG receive letters with the new leases in their letter box since about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The window for the new rent is open to the public since November 18.
"It works for almost a week, it is still on trial" replied after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client is presented as a journalist.
The déragulation and old apartments minors Bakal is a very sensitive issue locally.
Vice-Chairman of the parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats was fairly sustained before the elections, and it now meets the local newspapers.
"After 20 years, I want a new floor."
" I have not changed a put... to do wc, relieves introduction mentioned.
However, it is mainly, according to the employees, retirees who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent if they sign up now as RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a cut of half of the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires which have signed a new contract before 15 December.
But the window "deregulation" of the Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," said an employee at the counter.
And yet GARs proposed both on its web site that in the windows of individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent tribunal which will take the decision.
' This is not threats, but only to inform on the sole and legitimate way to act legally, " said RPG on its website.
"Here, nobody will go to court" believe one of RPG Byty and the man in the street outside the centre of customers give him right.
"I have 13000 kronor pension and I still have 5000 kroner to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek media requests that nobody sign and therefore people expect," says.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011, and the increases, according to Byty RPG, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents still do not reach the level required for the simple maintenance fund for housing," says Pavel Klimes, director of residential portfolio of the RPG Byty society, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing, which makes the angry tenant is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG has been with the rents invest $4 billion in the apartments, in four years to 2011 2014 that should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung from the ceiling in front of upholstered chairs in the waiting room of the Havirosvka Street, however, repeat some information marked in red.
The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of the apartments of RPG. "
"And it will always be no more than 50 Czech crowns the square metres per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 percent covers only 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, it is an increase of a very low amount 19.66 CZK m ²," adds RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promised that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money to rent increases (see graph) went to the apartment in the form of lower heating - new windows and heating.
Those who signed the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The school is a part, too, offices have understood the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint Brno is the new headquarters of the company. Design.
No one would have expected that it is also home to a mini-school with whatever it takes - walls of colors, imaginative furniture, toys, and finally a playground miniature on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can make the children of employees of Arch. design.
The company projects architectonic. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined his mini-school business since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age to have children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time as the contracts of work-time decreased, the kindergarten is a proposed bonuses to its employees by the company. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects and have the opportunity to combine work with taking care for children.
It is the people in Arch.Design.eux themselves who dreamed up this school and with the support of the leadership they have been able to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational program of human resources and the State Budget for the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the availability of funding ($2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They were able to purchase equipment and appliances, and after two years, ensuring a qualified staff, as well as the road.
After the use of the allocation of funding (two years) society. Design. obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is the Economy company rating that has helped make the staffing request.
The child care is provided by a qualified staff, all day, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher dealing with children. children can go to school without age restrictions, but they have more than three years for most.
As it is a "mini-school" can only have five children at the same time, but during the day there is more to be replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible, depending on the needs of parents and children of all employees have the right to use the school without regard to seniority.
Although it is agise care and education, the programme of the mini-school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not play, but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to prepare for school are taught English.
The class is not only of imaginative toys and games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time to control their children and not the stress of a delay to pick up children in a school near the place of parents.
Parents use their time more productively.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s' and is listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this programme reinforces the marketing.
The house in bone fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look in the interior of Gaudi.
The co-like on the back of a prehistoric saurien, the stairs to a backbone of dinosaur and balconies to Gules open fish.
It was the house Casa Battlo Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname House.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and facade mosaîque recalling scales and everywhere curves, that is all that is ypique for Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house held its dream, pleasant colours and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation it is geometry, the pace and order thought with precision.
On the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the printing of brilliance of colour is strengthened.
The winding and twisting forms also appears in the interior with the same measure.
Wood copy waves frames, balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eye and slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the street market Passeig de Gracia number 43, was born of the construction of a house in 1877 architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was done for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, was on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of a new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a home for multiple housing was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that decorations are born to an apartment in representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque to the facade.
For the facade also worked for other artists and creators.
The joint work on the house Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises have dubbed the home just after the finish because of its organic forms "bone."
Others, having regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows have called "the house that baille."
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi thought to house a single system in its time of central heating, with vents and chimneys.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the establishment Gaudi did not comply with the guidelines of building and did not interfere.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city construction permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after for finishing the municipal council was horrified, and asked for changes.
He did not like, for example, members of the council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the public sidewalk.
There was never change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) approval to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and the third a private room and a portion of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase by which you climb up to a terrace of independent co.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curves of the walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of liaison.
The party may be linked completely by opening the doors of fairs and high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received new facades a non-traditional toîture and two floors.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, white and blue glass tiles with which is decorated the interior courtyard and sinks of lights.
The two colours game provides a maximum amount of light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white interpretations that the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Battlo house that was included in the Fund's 2005 World Heritage of the UNESCO can be viewed by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the larger and more splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they have found that it is a lucrative business, and they have broadened the scope of visits to the common spaces and attic including terraces co.
The ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs EUR 16.50; students, pensioners, groups and cardholders tourism 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you have to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bed: women have other criteria than men.
Not ostentatious, but rather the quality of the space at bedtime, so the mattress and the bed provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course they should complement harmoniously to appeal to a specific user.
During the election, several things are critical: the weight, size, age, health status, as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of procedure in which it would put the mattress and the bed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country where it does not sleep continually latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "gently warm."
In addition, they have a superior weight to polyurethane mattresses standards.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough channels in heart and, if they remain on a sound board, they hold moisture and mold can also train.
The habit is also instrumental in the election.
Anyone who passes the clear time abroad, where it frequently uses very thick mattress with a layer rammollissante, feel hard on low and a hard surface.
"It is as well as all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, legs and ribs, they need mattresses with a rammollisante foam lazy."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes have a disorder of the nervous system that are evil" information "joints and skin," says Adamczikova Sylva who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
" Today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL to judge a lazy foam.
The "miracle" simply works.
It maximizes its strength and its form in the heat absorbed or adapts to the warmth of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you do not return in the night and after a difficult match.
You simply sleep better.
The lazy foam also functions as a protection against esquarres.
The choice of the mattress in terms of size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of size 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-bed should be 90 cm in all 180 cm.
In one place, the singles, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient to visit.
However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on his back, you should ask the hands comfortably with elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who has worked for several years, the problem of a sound sleep and ergonomics furniture and taught in schools.
For a bed to two places each needs its own bed and mattress, therefore, however, during the achât of choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will to mount the bed at different heights and it is not feasible on all bed frame.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattress springs at least 15 cm, this count for form and at least three centimetres.
"To touch or sitting on the mattress you do not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of bed.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and the bed are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
The mattress is aèrent very badly; it must not wash, which is commonly auhourd' today.
And since during the night sweats are normally 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after years 5/7, the mattress begins to recall a large (and) sieve.
The specialists refuse to advertise on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life.
But its but.
And a board of experience on the part of sellers: a mattress of 120/140cm, give up to the surface of the mattress, hygiene or washing but add protection that vouspouvez easily remove and wash.
And even if these days it is often produce coatings with zipper for all, that is to say that it was after the opening two parties (for washing and the size of a washing machine that is very important!) or manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when withdraws a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid board instead of a bed?
Never!
The maximum for a bed for the visitors in a single night.
However équipez do (there is) no ventilation holes and use the mattress springs with a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A mattress polyurethane should not be part of such a bed.
For slats box to unique position with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal, but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the bottom part of the kidney and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress at several positions should not be taken to spring mattresses because it does not change of position.
Apart from the adjustment of the rigidity of the slats can also install what is known as a cradle of shoulder.
It is a special liaison slats that allows to pressure or accept the slide to the shoulder of the Dungeness "fit."
For men who have "the broadest shoulders back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses, which for the "male" have begun to use a rammollissante area at the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer a softer surface at the level of the hips.
For the most difficult client there are box wings or platelets with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure is spreading in more and diinue tension.
But, of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and bed, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and pointed to reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles to relax.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm as the Scandinavians for example.
When one is lying on its side, the pillow to upgrade (with the cradle of shoulder bed or rammollie area in the mattress) shoulder height.
The modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also organic mattresses.
The raw materials of oils, from which it manufactures polyurethane are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use precisely soybeans.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is manufactured using natural products," says vasicek Petr society Tropico Plus.
The natural materials are also used for the coating mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants to ensure that the surface of the mattress absorbs heat and cool the body, "cool," coatings "heat" women.
The extract of red pepper accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore more for the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure more breathable than the standard polyurethane and more elastic.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foam gives polyzones mattress who know exactly where the head, lower back and feet.
You will pay a mattress quality from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health are less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Save for the mattress and the bed is not simple.
We may from time to time in the context of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
As for example the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattress with memory foam sewn Memory coating to 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second charge.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and great thickness was begun with the Tempur material to a "cosmic" pace.
It started as a subject for NASA because astronauts suffered at the start of the huge load factors.
The Tempur is rammollit heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It is therefore perfectly adapted to the human body warm and distributes an optimum pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and an increase of comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam are used not only for the mattress, but also for health products, such as special cushions for the feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC foam or Twinsaver or of the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child brings more people to think about the monitor through a GPS.
The system put in place at the beginning to search the cars may also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases, such as for example the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as big a box of matches, but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is not a spy, but only one way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr Pilin society MAcro Weil is one of the suppliers of backtracking on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met with such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," adds Pilin.
He said children should always know what is used "the box" and how it can be used in case of emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child does not want to be a thing of this type, it débarassera.
' And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to rid express something when they don't want to be under control. "
"The phones, which may cut as these devices tracing, have already led parents to long delays," says Bockova.
The fact that this type of aircraft to assist in case of aggression is highly debatable.
"It is a prepared abduction, the author is going to do everything possible to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as the equipment will expand tracing, they (criminals) will also seek because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She says that such devices can help in a non-aggression, prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech society RC Monitoring, which proposes tracking services for both cars and people, claims to have this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
"The device can be fine-tuned so that it is in regular broadcast after a specified period."
"In cases where the aircraft is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer who immediately reported the position of the person who has slipped and is lying without moving, " said Cech.
According to the so-called mobile smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatted with a special prologiciel.
The problem of current tracing systems is that it is a device similar to those that door pendant the size of a box of matches to smaller telephone equipment.
You can always lose.
According to Pilina society Macro Weil, that is why the tests are being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not recognize the tracing device."
"Or it would report after a certain period of time, which would have given the police a little more time," he says.
The tracing is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, utilisiera always the same technology for cars.
It is a combination of acquisition systems position using GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone to alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has both detonating cords that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with, but it can hold only two years.
The army has purchased for 445 km fuses used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the fuses is two to four years.
The army has purchased detonating cord to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff has given as the reason for the achât a huge quantity of detonating cord to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of reservation to hold made by the pyrotechniciens army that MF DNES contacted, it shows that even the general officers with a command, secretaries or personal household should have a period every year to explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, the commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cord.
This represents 25000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the reserves of the army could meet for 10 years.
If it is true that the base of each new professionals it is enough to more than 2 meters of detonating cord, as the experts say, this means that the army with his new purchase assured - with the use of special units and engineering - reserves for 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the brigade rapid response have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and shooting sessions are limited because of the need for money.
About the lack of underwear we don't talk about.
"And I am not the head if they buy home if a large quantity of detonating cord."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we are trying as traders to please," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argues the achât hundreds of kilometres of detonating cord by the fact that the army will be the "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky STV Group reported, however, only four years of life of detonating cord and pyrotechniciens police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it may even go up to four years," said one who does not want his name published in regard to the criticism of the army.
The period of life past, each number must be tested to see if it is honest and does not threaten the life of a soldier.
These tests are not free and still cost money.
The other department's argument is a discount due to the amount for 445 km of detonating cordeux.
"We have cost 60 percent less than the supply of the past year of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek is the interpreter of the opinions of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of pyrotechniciens police that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or after the Soviet army, does not exceed the 1500 metres.
And the police still control only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
It has been established for safety reasons pyrotechniciens and to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating cord more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the disposal of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, focus on the Rhine.
What lies ahead in a few years the Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords that she now buys "cheap."
Until today, I take advantage of contacts that I have achieved through competition.
The sale under free of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, contractor for 28 years.
His journey to success is like a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec it lacked a hosting site quality at a reasonable price.
Its savings on what he had earned while working abroad, and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small building 5 apartments, half-demolished.
Knowing that he was a student in the third year of graduate school, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has inspired me to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began has rent the first apartment reconstructed to foreign workers.
It reinvests the benefit in the building where he transformed with 54 beds.
Since that time, their contractor has enabled him to open up to 4 Libérec pensions, two restaurants in style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The more comfortable among them was until recently the four-star Pytloun hotel design.
This year it was another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of duty-free and other candidates for the duty-free Pytloun hotels have shown," the No. 1 entrepreneurs of the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a hotel on a large scale the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served us well," says Pytloun with recognition.
The victory gave him more popularity and be known Libérec and its environs.
"People recognize me in the streets, often appreciated, and I must say, that it was very pleasant," he says.
It recommends that the participation in the competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he uses until today his contacts and knowledge that he would not have been able to obtain another way.
" With those I met through the competition I started to do business on a regular basis.
According to him, the renowned linked to success has had an impact also on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I see among them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been recognized in general."
" It is not, by far, the only result of my work, but the result of a good job of all of us together.
"My name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the Farmet winner has the worst behind.
The person who came seeking price Slovansky Dum for first place in the competition for the firm of the year organized by the Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The board has rewarded the effort with which he has transformed a workshop equipment Ceska Skalice to a firm with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
I can say that the award has encouraged not only me my also my collaborators and increased our confidence to combat competition, " said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he has not hesitated for a long time, has denied a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a company with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic tubs.
Not long after they have begun to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
It has become after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was well known in the public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to really better brand awareness Farmet but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were working with a company that received the greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not dropped to just Farmet established the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company had been made on the basis of economic results of 2008 and into 2009.
And precisely in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts new materials and technologies.
"We have not escaped, of course, this situation."
"The numbers of cases have fallen by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fire," said Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society should know that from time to time we need to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation correctly and have retained recipients results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, Farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with holdings a centre for training and research, have strengthened the presentation of the company in international shows and earned the top awards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures affires back and with the number of employees.
"The new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The survey, which removes the senseless regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdité year for the fourth time is a part of the clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The inglorious winner this year of the survey on the Absurdité year was obliged to make in the offices of the documents that officials can obtain on-line.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, the government Social Affairs asked a paper extract from the register of commerce, while the official can get two mouse clicks.
This exchange with the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will no longer extract from the register of commerce for controls on payments of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesman of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must meet in the Czech Republic and delete those absurd is the meaning of this competition for the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the clan affairs organized by Hospodarske noviny and even greater popularity.
If the past year 3000 voting occurred, it is at least 4000 this year who have made their voices heard.
And it is not surprising, it is in our country the most diverse legal obligations which only slow the business, and more.
"We may be the number of paperwork for tax returns in the first places in the world," said Karel Havlicek Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity becomes a declared aim of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in the 74 th place to respect the conditions for the company, or 8 seats compared to last year.
The Absurdité this year has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continue each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can make each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To report there is the Web site www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antipremio" and let the public vote for the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdité received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the latest survey of the past year, it is a hundred or more precisely, 105 and décrêts regulations that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the trade unions and teachers.
Among the finalists ' competition, thus among the nominees is for example the requirement that the vehicle maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls or entrepreneurs with 20 employees, repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which starts at the beginning of November on the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which regularly personalities from politics and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
' The economic prosperity cannot function when the state makes âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and my goal is to remove every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicates the business, " said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove décrêts absurd is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, which does not suit the people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for personal business to the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was abolished with the ammendement Act individual enterprise.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare the Labour Office travel service for a foreign employee in 30 days, has been removed with the Act on the so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdité 2009 was the Order for therapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This has been changed by order of the Department of Health last year the requirement to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Assessing the environmental projects, humanitarian, training and sports.
The novelty of this year's competition, Hospodarske Noviny, which already exists in the last five years, is called the Firm Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif this competition is reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and a socially responsible business," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the operator's mobile phone firm Vodafone, which is the guarantor and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
In this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, are companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is guiding and an independent article would edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another can be considered their support activity and anticipation as the denominator for their efforts.
In one case, the disabled and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic is not the example of prologiciels pragoise And Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams for their employees who are then number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company which is for 17 years the main contributor to the endowment fund, which is sponsoring the disabled children.
Care of employees with health problems include The old manufacturing plant Podebrad paper which employs more than 70 percent, and for this, was awarded the title of the firm for the central region of Bohemia and placed third in the region in support of the firm of the year organized by Vodafone.
Has Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which won for introducing more flexible working hours and reduced to 35 hours per week on average, and without, proportionellement, salary reduction.
The Board déverné title because it achête priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity and cares about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible for our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit of Usti region also think the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services to a local factory protected for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadows that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy representative of society.
At the very last row, also for its activities, a society of Wash and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which is involved in the pension insurance for its employees in the form of bonuses above the standard.
"In our society we are contributing to food, transportation, the increase of qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac construction company of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
Were automatically enrolled in the company category, all regional finalists for the firm of the year of Vodafone, which had responded to the questionnaires attached document for registration and had returned to the organizer before August 15.
The evil met or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms did not respond to questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm, but were not disqualified" primary "Firm of the Year" Vodafone.
"The independent entries are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the firm of the year," said Karel Goldman agency organizer Bison & Rose.
The Lands in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Fund for the Lands in Plzen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The detectives were handcuffed to the local contractor and trading in real estate Lubos.G.
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed site is secured by a candidate.
It had to pay to Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are still a person for insider trading in a tender and a public." Said the newspaper Pravo the head of Plzen's Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more information because the investigation is ongoing.
The police have handed over 24 hours after the contractor to 46 years in freedom.
To find out how it could affect a public competition, we can only speculate with regard to the little official information.
A question of Pravo, spokesman of the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen on a workplace separated, and, during the public competition.
" It was a client and in no way an employee, she said.
The public competitions on Cerna has true name "call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the land" and put in place when occur several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people have, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be resolved before being announced the value of the land."
"The proposed rights a ranking of buyers is in place and land then transfers the field to the person who proposed the highest rights," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information on people who had signed the appeal, and as he himself is also a beneficiary as having purchased a large number of rights for refunds, he had proposed to candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he cashed without doubt to withdraw.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above standards in FdT (Land Fund).
It appeared in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot was prosecuted criminally for editing land for which had already been edited the decision of setting up a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained such land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place that would be built artery access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged with the mayor for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far greater.
The town hall was obliged to accept because it would put the construction at risk by a blockade of land.
Households will pay an additional 100 kroner monthly for housing.
Households will from January pay a supplement, not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, supplies of heating and in some places the rents will also increase.
Families must therefore from January of their purses up to 100 kroner monthly more than now.
Electricity increases of 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to one-tenth of the water supply and in many places the central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be around for households in apartment 100 kroner annually more than at present.
However, all suppliers have cut the price of electricity because of the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaÏques batteries.
The gas is increasing moderately, but of course at a time when people most in need to heat and therefore have a greater consumption.
Therefore, it can also count 100 kroner.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest common plan price increases.
For example, the Pardubice households or Hradec Kraloce pay starting in January for central heating almost 50 kroner per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 kroner annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation in the event that the city increase rents infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will be part of the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
The rents will increase for example significantly in the thousand 450 apartments rented from January that is to say at the end of regulation.
For example, the ICC Byty company which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rent paid by people in almost 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children saoûlent rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and very slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that bring more often than those who saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years ago, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism is not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of the doctors who face similar cases admissions departments children hospitals.
"The beers or wines are no longer fashion because it takes time to be saoûl."
"The trend is really up to the spirits," says for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the department's children's hospital Horovice in Central Bohemia.
" When they manage to chiper bottle candy in the closet, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka that prevail.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and not feel it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman of the Motol hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it is rum or fernet."
"Today is the alcohol including mode in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice they have brought from home," said Jurinova.
According to the Pélikan Department head, see drunk children aged 13 to 14 years for hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to working at Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he held ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren broad drunken environs.
" A young girl was hospitalized and four times
"It acommencé his career at 12 years old when she was involved with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in the blood with a mixture of the extasy," described the doctor this particularly important cases.
"It was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice at a party."
"What is interesting is that it was not peculiar to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours," said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the selflessness of parents or their tolerance out of the ordinary about the fact that their offspring is to drink are the main cause of alcohol to children.
According to the experts, it does not, however, addiction, in the strict sense, for children.
"As the alcoholic is a chronic alcohol dependence of several years with all the attendant phenomena, but that is not found in children."
"Among those who use alcohol to repeat, it is rather a back-socio-family ground significantly negative," explained the head of the Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinical pediatrics at Motol.
Are integrated into the stastistiques cases with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization.
The drunk children after emergency care brought home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
In addition to the children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan exsite three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day witches, Good Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They drink in spite of poor performance or on the contrary, they are celebrating the start of the holiday."
"Of course I lived day admission witches 7 drunk children in one fell swoop," said Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision, paradoxically, is in a better position than the one who returned home and the aftermath of the "hangover."
The headache morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are removed by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are for this better off since they spend a good evening and a gentle wake up and not their evil."
"They are just astonished at the location where they are," says Pélikan knowing that from time to time this striker good humour patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospital-bed intensive care up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have used this as a means of education with these children how their drunkenness has cost, and that they could spend all summer seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the insurance companies in their GESTIONS declining, which should recover from parents expenses related to care, do not treat children drunk.
Two L-159 for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 had five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the seat aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type will become property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad in exercises or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seaters versions of L-159T1 up to now in service in the Czech army and were flying.
Lestrois remaining are monoplaces versions of L-159.
They are stationed at the moment in Aéro Vodochody and through commercial - the firm Omnipol - took into account the last week.
According to Jan Pejsek from the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody is currently unknown.
' The aircraft L-159 monoplaces planned to exchange were taken on aircraft stored long without charges or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence ."
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Право Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater because the department has signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody agreement worth $200 million for the conversion of four monoplaces L-159 unused in two two-seaters.
The army has taken delivery of the first plane in July, the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft equipment in some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract, it is clear that the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots of NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case that takes into account how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched bidding and contacted directly EADS.
The leadership of the defence arguments while the exchange provides a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has purchased Aéro Vodochody 72 aircraft and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The acquisition of Casa aircraft will probably be legal implications.
The European Commission has yet filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen through a tender at European level and in any case directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three planes Casa, the latter should arrive at the airport in Prague Kbely in two weeks.
A longer index that the ring is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index above the ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger is simple test risk of prostate cancer, especially for men before age 60," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine what men should undergo testing for prostate cancer, particularly in combination with the genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors such as health antécedents family, " said Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 it has followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and, at the same time, nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right index shorter than the ring.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, was found the same likelihood of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the longest index that ring the risk, however, fell to 33 percent for men before the 60-year reduction of risk has risen to 87 percent.
The length of two fingers - cited trained during the prenatal period - including the different levels of sex hormones which is exposed to the child in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that supports the development of prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the National Academy of Sciences, said CTK that he was aware of this study, but that he did not think it appears that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely proven."

The United States have a new "smart"
The US military has sent in Afghnistan a new "smart" weapon, only known by the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super gun
The projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few metres.
The special caliber ammunition 25 mm developed for the rifle and containing a highly explosive functioned as small grenades.
You can program the ammunition so that they will be in contact with the target, but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
Therefore, it can use against an enemy that hides behind a barrier, a wall or a gap.
It is not protected from on high and when it comes over a deadly rain of flashes of steel, it can incapacitate.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon infantry that uses the "smart" technology.
" The soldier is used mainly in such a way that it is the target, a laser beam that determines the distance, and received a specific target, according to which it corrects its site and based on the trigger.
"Let us say that you have referred to 543 meters."
" When you squeeze the trigger, the gun charge and draws the 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 metres, Audette said.

As Wednesday, said the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far on the Marienbader of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on the Lyoner rue du Quartier Straße Niederrad Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered in the region so far.
The supply of rental was extremely attractive, and the open office of Astro Park better suited to the mode of collaborators.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad presents us with an important location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region has raised yesterday the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers.
The economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith on the location."
Fujitsu is to the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (green), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations would not change anything to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons have been decisive.
The challenge now is to avoid such a unique place remains vacant for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place of City Hall, used by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical," as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the construction project's controversial spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a developer of private projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and City Hall, which prompted widespread criticism, not only because of the impressive development surfaces that were formerly part of parking, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company and investment advisers, Feri, the manufacturer of computer systems for the travel distribution, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, have moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German group specialised Frankfurt-Chancen Immobilien bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund, Morgan Stanley and a year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA, based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it is computers and servers to companies and also provides a vital service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square metres have leased in the building Astro Park.
This complex 20-year-old, whose name recalls its plan star, among others, is the headquarters of the Confederation of electronics and electrical engineering industry.
The expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is finding it increasingly difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site dedicated to the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder, Mr. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks is attacked with ever greater force.
The group of cyber-activists " Wikileaks has more access to its server hosted so far in America and is now seeking a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the leading US Senator Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists originally revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the e-business, Amazon had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists have used the Web Service Amazon (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "great, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem at Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The television channel CNN, citing the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon has prohibited Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation conducted by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper "the Guardian."
"I would have liked that Amazon to take this measure earlier in relation to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Lieberman has called on other countries to deny the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it is our national security at risk and threatening the lives around the world," according to a press release of the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper The Independent, " the Australian 39 years living in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified intrigues orchestrated by its detractors prosecutions by Sweden.
The spokesman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange particularly fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why Wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks should be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the head of government Mr. J. Stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironic way, that Mr. Assange should " be killed " and that Mr. Obama could use a Drone. "
Meanwhile, an argument broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the American president, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and released recently, to engage in espionage.
"I don't know exactly why we must take the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a Web site."
The US government is now fully to the test the protection of its databases.
According to a press release from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre of counter-terrorism, has been appointed to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which the entire administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that he wanted to address the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have made every effort to contact them," said the spokesman for the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
"University" Gelato Bologna, prepares confectioners of ice the best seasons of the year.
The introductory course of three days for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
In fact, the entire ice?
The Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, which is to say, the German producer of ice somewhat old-fashioned, manufactures cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of manufacture of the ice.
The ice turbine removes the cream ice of chilled using a spatula, the gaufre and then began to sell.
To find out, there was no need to go to dell Anzola Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières founded the university ice in 2003 so that the ice creams exits its machines everywhere meet Italian high ideals.
The introductory course of three days for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses on the ice of chocolate and extending over several days. Practices sessions are held in the private glacerie.
In full midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their yearning on the smooth ice.
This time, it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of arts education come to California is a man of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European future product quality in the country's industrial Glace.
Anke Berlin consultant in business management, and it wants to, after a few years, make something of this profession for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the wife of Canadian household came because his children love the Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explained to participants ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Is crucial not only good taste, but also the trademark flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano has not forgotten during the training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of laughter."
The first step in the production is quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer which heats to 85 degrees through an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opened a valve installed on the machine: it has a white cream base pasteurized, the foundation of all sorts of ice milk.
The trainer is immediately besieged question: is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizing?
How can we unleash the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against be misled by the spirit of the times.
Anyone who does not speak "made from natural ingredients," perhaps in spite of this used stabilizers: more often than not a natural product, for example, the flour guar seed obtained from the bean guar.
It is of course possible to manufacture ice without the use of stabilizing, it only needs to sell within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer croquera does nothing other than ice pellets.
Some modifications of the estate are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavors.
The master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that it acquires in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is the powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will all pass you dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
In the income of sherbet fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the ice cream made from the mass of white core, adding egg becomes a yellow and cream is, when you add the cocoa powder, the basis of all the possible desserts chocolate.
Now, all the participants must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and nutty, with or without eggs in the estate, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances more fruit purees: from the standpoint of taste, it is not necessarily better.
The ice hazelnut does not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
Ice the kiwi fruit, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less than stabilizing.
"Only a balanced mixture is properly the taste of a lens," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation: if we use the puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar is reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for the lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the wine is used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables are facilitating the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention.
It is not just the machine manufacturing automatic mass base.
There is also a device in which beats the same mixture of ice available to make the buttery and reduced to zero temperatures.
Despite all the automatisations, light failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is turning streets red with fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, a blemish on his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes.
The master Luciano is of the view that "this incident is likely to occur in every way: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry which is testing the cultivation of genetically modified plants has hijacked the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the group of experts Testbiotech is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr. Munich Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports that the chairman of the expert group Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the group Ilsi pressure.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked a decisive contribution to the development of test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and, thus, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The specifications are verbatim, paragraphs, the positions of the group Ilsi pressure and thus bear the mark of the industry that, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities moved to Parma in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A senior manager of the Efsa recently joined unconditionally and without a transitional period, the Swiss food group Syngenta, She has changed sides.
There is little time, even Radio Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union authority responsible for monitoring and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion of the German Federal Environment Agency that MEPs.
However, the Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it is reliable data, including those of the industry as they are of good quality.
It does not prohibit experts working for the Efsa to establish contact with the industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The agency sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who owns, among other things, the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr. Then resent the fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without any test food animals and to test the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize cause" says Then.
The current practice is to test only proteins isolated and not all the genetically modified plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If we do not risk, then how can we discover?" Asks Mr. Then on an accusatory tone.
It is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is trying to more influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
That is why it is barely even researchers who are not tied to corporations.
In the view of the business, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "industry control security research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell was obtained, a total of approximately 400 kg.
Monday afternoon, it was before the station in Stuttgart with a tube in the back.
There was manif.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September, excavators came and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the central station in Stuttgart in an underground station, which will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the arrest of the construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (limestone areas) Crailsheim, a poorly constructed and coarse pavement between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years living in Osifildern.
He purchased a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He said enthusiastically: "a small rock and cheap, simple and land."
It saying that by cutting the saw, he sensed the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what it will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell.
The traces of stones in Stuttgart to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire of stones.
The 44-year-old man is trade old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the landfill," he says in his office in a mud hut, which was once a guard post.
He said that he had been the subject of insults and threats when, in September, newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing of the demolition company.
But it has negotiated for days with opponents S21.
And he explained that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 subsequently won a parallélépipède stone weighing on average 80 kilos with a value of between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some of the guard as souvenirs in while also hoping to make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full shipments of a truck.
About half are still packed into the forest, the rest being long since sold.
Owners of gardens, gardeners, Individuals landscape.
They came from everywhere, and took away everything that could go into the trunk and trailers.
These stones Stuttgart scandal surfaced long " Mäuerle or limitations of toes.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" Mr. Rongen said.
"Had it not been this political component."
In his car, off-road tour of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law that it has abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before later and eventually become a carrier.
And a fan of stones.
It stores 40000 tonnes.
It raises are treasures everywhere in Germany.
IL asserts that it is the largest dealer of ancient stones.
It is suppress.
The sand stones carved with art on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, " he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the road that rises through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre of red sand, formerly part of the railway station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The parallélépipède was once part of the Neckarstadion Stuttgart.
Across the snow stones and stories, the travertine to Cannstatt from the prefecture of police, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen believes that once the stones were carved by hand and displaced by using simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, it becomes quite friendly.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in play."
It did not become rich, still less wealthy.
But the carrier now has 14. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener were installed in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the recycler of waste.
Soon, he will be in Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Control of talent to win the top potential
The counter is strong attendance.
16 students are lining up to buy bread rolls to salmon, tomato sauce and white-meals.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and automaker Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
In a competition of ideas, they should speak to on the car of the future with the developers of VW, and, by the way, knowing the firm Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to in the competition for best brains and to commit themselves, such as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the brightest graduates as much as possible in the classroom before they enter the job market and they are courted by the other.
And since universities do not publish statements regarding the performance of their students, trying to identify the exceptional talents in practical projects and loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talent.
A young lady service staff sharing pens, candy and cards bearing the logo of Volkswagen.
She spoke of the calendar of professional courses and students jobs for young talent; it shows roads for access to the grounds of the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig, who is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both sides: "students come into contact with the industrial sector and gain experience."
"The Volkswagen group, it may hear students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who are taken into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become even more bitter.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their staff sorting on a plethora of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and especially courted the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from the fields of engineering, who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40000 engineers posts remained vacant in October.
And according to forecasts by the VDI, the gap for engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes hunting for talent for the KPMG audit firm, accounting and consulting.
It organizes costly events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the cruise KPMG race Race, a kind of rally-paper where competitors must find their way to the aid of GPS coordinates.
The company and will send eight promising students next year so that they are on the way the United States.
Participants may visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and the company.
Should participate decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, means used in the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the hunter of talent that is Mr. Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are on the verge of completing their education and want to send their applications soon to our company." He says.
Outside the amadouement direct campus, small and medium-sized businesses are quite classic participating in trade fairs, where they are engaged in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve graduates attending shows."
"For example, the show of solar technologies," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources in Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the problem.
Currently, 35 are competitions on the site of the company.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It is expensive and time-consuming," says?
Another way to establish the contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of professional courses or write his draft study end among us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced in the specialists of the sun.
That is why the company is trying to make its advertising highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do that," says Stübe, chief of staff.
There is a long time that the money is no longer the main role in the search for employment.
The flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for promotion are the other factors.
According to a study conducted by the institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the top 100 employers of Germany.
The institute is a table of annual honour of German employers.
To that end, he asked the staff on their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while watching the framework conditions for employees.
The chief of staff Stübe Ms. hopes that this investment will enhance the image of the company from job seekers.
"I think the candidates relies primarily on external evaluations in relation to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employeur branding Akademie, DEBA) advises businesses that want to build a good reputation as an employer in a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to visit attractive is through its own staff," he says.
It is called, according to the jargon used in the industry, the strategy of domestic image, that is to say, the creation of the image of the employer within its own workforce.
"Satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When treating its employees and that they identify with the company, they are just advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if we played in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, south-eastern state of the United States, over the years to come.
The government in Washington delivered a prohibition equivalent ban and, thus, definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon," which is at the root of this strict ban must remain in force at least for the next five years.
In the face of this accident that claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the business sector, had indicated that he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution and to reduce the dependence of the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of billions, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its findings in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze imposed drilling after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, different oil groups immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With more stringent control measures and more stringent security requirements, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The supervisory authority, which was discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms in depth.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced would remove the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the sector of oil and gas" as the result of a current survey conducted in the area by the audit firm BDO, prior to the ban on drilling delivered Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty of this sector: "nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulations."
Investments made in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it smells similar to that which exists in the petrol station: because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
The men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"You exhaust," launches the environmentalist to journalists for the calm: "you still enough mud of oil before the lens of water."
The Nigerian 37 years tried to photograph a young stuck in the muddy water up to his chest, as well as the fat that surrounds it: the scene seems almost in the flash of water the color of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown patches of crude oil.
On the bank of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom said that once it was collecting buckets shrimp here.
But meanwhile the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil poured out of a pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen living in the small neighbouring town of Bodo must now pull for six hours to reach the rich waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation is obvious leafing through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat breaks a brown water cradingue. Anyone plunges his hand cut the whole covered with oil.
The roots of mangrove emerge from the soil as licorice sticks. The isolated palms are sadly hang their flippers.
We look in vain the flocks of birds, as is usually found in wetlands: as soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of old who resembles a service station by the smell it.
"What is happening here, it is war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari a sad: "our lives are characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
The comparison is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: there are more than 60 years, the first European explorers have entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by Ken Saro-Wiwa. was executed later in 1993, the group Shell was forced to suspend its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return of Ogoni is prohibited in this society: while more than 2 million barrels of black gold are daily pumped through more than 5000 wells and 7000 miles of pipelines in the region of the Delta, three times as large as Switzerland, the country's oilfields Ogoni are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in water tréteaux steel as bizarre sculptures: is very affectionately "Christmas trees" heads boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, most of which are blighted by corrosion until benchmarks.
Akpobari believes that a drilling of this nature breaks from time to time in the piece, as a steady flow of crude oil flows in the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that leaked into the sea at the time of the accident of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility for environmental pollution persistent? The answer to that question divides the actor.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, see explosions warheads drilling and pipeline punctured as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner reproached the Shell Group to apply in Nigeria of essentially less stringent safety standards than anywhere else in the world: only the rate of failures of pipelines is "still much higher than alleures."
Some emerging forms of mangroves in a place that, viewed from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of gunk and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered in gunk up to his neck.
A light glints off one of many that sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without ground on the site must be found: a small illegal refinery.
It is heat crude oil in the barrel for several hours, " says Michael, the team leader.
As a first step, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of kerosene drops fall and finally gets diesel.
That is the way that Michael and his four colleagues daily four drums of diesel to 300 litres, " it reported 34000 Naira, about 22 million.
The people of the Delta take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest producer of oil in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than the ridiculously low barely 40 euro cents per litre of diesel: because they acquire their raw material.
It is offered by the "protectors" that the network of pipelines in piercing across the country of Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the first temporarily stored illegally is purified: organized crime networks that are also among its members, politicians and high-ranking military officers, the lion's share in tankers and dumping on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on the issue of whether to assign the environmental disaster, or rather the subversive activities to the population or lax production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders, and if the foundations of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
But, Meanwhile, the relationship of the Ogoni especially vis-à-vis Shell had so deteriorated that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal of the group. "May be that the operators of other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove to be better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can occur at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but at most they will offer bribes.
Even the soldiers, mainly from the north of the country as benefit all Nigerians.
"At any point of view, this rotten trick brought down our country down," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in the reactors of the A380
The A380 is clearly a big problem.
In considering a device that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible lack of construction that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the airline Quantas clearly had far more fortunate: in the course of the investigation, the Australian authority responsible for air safety found that reactors of some aircraft A380 presented a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible default.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, says in a position published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure" reactors.
Concerned reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft of the A380.
The Airbus company Quantas, who had to fly emergency in Singapore on November 4, is among them.
The Australian airline now initiated legal proceedings against the French manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney, and it gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The director of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would seek damages related to the incident in early November.
Have spare parts and the bearing surface was damaged in the fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce is inflammation of oil that is at the root of the damage.
After the incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that further testing will be done on the superjumbos are also equipped with the reactors.
The recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman for the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The problem is regarded as important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall throughout causes chaos in transport
Germany covered in white: in one night, snow fell on most of the country.
The chaos on roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is grelotter Germany by frigid temperatures, almost all of the republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, which led to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, the snow cover reached 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the winter has worked on a permanent basis, but they have not been overcome snow continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (LOS) expects the tsunami occurred on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, with water levels up to 1.2 metres above normal.
Piles of snow on motorways and on federal roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Meteomedia weather warning announced the alert level was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it has fallen 30 centimetres of fresh snow that strong winds and costs have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stranded at night.
Even in the land of from Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities announced serious disruption on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind led to an interruption of traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 highway.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, trees fell on the tracks, better or destroyed.
In Saxony, it had to interrupt the Leipzig-Nuremberg interregional transport.
In Sallfeld in Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and beverages.
Winds of snow swept away roads.
The snow falls led to numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said that 40 flights have been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stranded at the airport are more numerous, despite barely 400 beds are available.
The accident occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening at Ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught up in a level-crossing because the vehicle was stationary.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth in Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when his car was barrel on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: the snow is always soft and powdery, but it tourbillonnera in case of light.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent winds and fast.
It is, however, very cold, at least 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: according to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could fetch up to 500 million euro.
Deutsche Bank has just to embellish the headquarters of the group: the twin towers in the Quartier business have been upgraded; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
Now, the group is clearly trying to recover the cost of renovations and is seeking a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings we or to sell, and rent again later."
That is the largest financial institution has already transferred its headquarters shortly after.
It is only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for $272 million Euro to holders of own funds; she had rehabilitated.
The changes to the energy value have gobbled up, according to some estimates, around 200 million euros.
A sale would, of course, a lot of money in the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in the industry believe the value of the towers, renamed meanwhile "green towers," to about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not known whether the buildings will be re-sold funds belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people are mourning the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10000 people have had a thought for the buried miners who have been declared dead following several explosions at a mine.
It had not yet been able to recover the bodies because the security situation in the affected wells continues to be precarious.
There are just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but there were no signs of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was unable to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities had considered that the miners had no more chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, parents and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun to Greymouth south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, was installed 29 tables on which you could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photographs and personal effects, including clothing and as surfboards, also had their place.
Flags were flown at half-mast at all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the Memorial Day that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the miners occurred at the surface.
"But they are never returned to the house."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in pits said that it may not resign themselves to accept the death of his son as long as he has not seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion of 19 November.
Relief workers have begun to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The police commissioner Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the hot temperatures inside the mine begin to decline.
Go to hell, warrior!
The film is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind through his film, "Walhalla Rising," epic.
How public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn has been thinking about turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; there is his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, removes his opponents one after the other, and this seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of killing when he is in a bad mood, it severs the intestines of its enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the acorn says no word on his real name and even the other characters leak, at most, in one or two sentences a few cries of terrible agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and festoie in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape in Scotland, which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
It would be ideal, the more mature filmmakers with an interest in the existentialisme and for the excellent travellings.
When a film is several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "pusher," his trilogy on the fierce drug trafficker and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema and art test.
Most of the supporters of cinema art must be the horror of the brain that is spreading around and intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the acorn embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silenced.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, hiding behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogue in this film, or a coherent, atmosphere is a fever dream transformed into film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn given barely a moment of relaxation and slowly cut throat with frigid images and an audio tape dismal, but especially with an elusive hatred that comes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy who is faithfully alongside the acorn, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed heroes whose motives are not known, but to hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies turning into warrior, may be sent to the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but also, perhaps, for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, which aims to irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthwork
The International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this is a country that refuses to take a position on this subject, much less to submit to inspections by the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious building cubic form on Syrian territory.
It is situated on the shore of the euphrate; the largest city near 30 kilometres: it is as Dair-Sur.
His name appears in the documents of the IAEA, as it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built apparently with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric power.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the reactor, known as the nearby, Al-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which could produce atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images blurred.
Through animation, computer-aided it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant, which is a copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, it has presented photos showing the building nearby, even within it.
It seems that the reactor was on the verge of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, there are barely more information than at the time, and even with the time the mystery deepens.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor el-Kibar, but had peu' evidence this country developed "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "suspected" reactor, even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
The lack of tangible evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Asked about how it ensures that it is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat of the United Nations gave a terse response was claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions."
The Syrian certainly abducted with haste the rubble "unused military building" and conducted a methodical leveling the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a Member State images of commercial satellite providers showing the time that followed directly attaque. it seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired exclusive.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret atomic program and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has challenged that argument after analyzing particles as an unlikely.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion on this issue, as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to conduct a second inspection on the site of Al-Kibar and refused access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "we will never comments on this issue."
That is how the investigation of this case has been dragging on for June 2008 without a result and that it "becomes increasingly a serious credibility problem," as acknowledged by a Western senior diplomat in service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty to ban nuclear weapons.
The IAEA believes that to make progress, we must clarify the existence of the other three facilities must be "substantive" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not specified what facilities here it is, or what is their function or they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ," they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj al-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of neighbouring towns.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) Washington has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images of a complex near Masyaf would very likely one suspect objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly beside it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection team is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on military installations.
Indeed, it is an information provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttling between the three sites and the parallélépipède stone to transport.
A Western senior diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities "could be used to produce fuel."
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, which are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly working through the non-enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is the rigour of plausible assumptions about the fundamental questions: where would have uranium and would be separated later plutonium needed to manufacture the bomb.
It is unclear whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in three sites.
When the hundreds of truckloads of land will have disappeared, no one will have information on the location of the storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria was considering in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres of el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if he can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
Analysing recent satellite photographs to the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor.
Satellite photographs show, however, that Syria has begun excavation work in the three suspects and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped to avert suspicion.
As he said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets, and the only time investment shows what interest the inspectors to this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also made a mockery of this proposal.
It was a year ago, while the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported in this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States that evokes the past few months, which is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The IAEA chief, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to the future," but it is still hesitating.
The plea is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries that are here have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as the diplomat who gives réflechir: "it would be, if they do not find anything"
Love in time of war
Bad since Angelina Jolie has made its debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
There is nothing more about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love its Serbian torturer during the war in Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested in response, some sequences planned shooting in Sarajevo have been displaced in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic organization of women victims of war has sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet with actress. Beautiful itself is goodwill ambassador of the UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed for these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined the offer.
"The meeting to be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie says long enough on its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reported that the organization of Hasecic was subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the quality ambassador of goodwill to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie has written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his scenario, after some hesitation granted permission to film in Sarajevo, but we do not know why is not then come despite this authority.
The young author herself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is a lot of effort that it was aware of the Yugoslav conflict. It maintains that it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and provide an opportunity for all parties involved to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet, and it is quite different: lovers know each other well before the start of the war; it meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported to the concentration camp of Serb where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference with the version "a rape victim is amourache his executioner."
That the film Jolie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on, and expresses Jolie is "unfair and based on information erronnées."
Now, only the fanatics Hollywood can provide peace: by illegally this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let us us!
Tonight, everything is again among the Irish.
Not a trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans howl of joy against the backdrop of a strong music, they trample feet.
Baileyu-Pub in Cork in the south irlande vibrates because players launch and manage to topple bullets table tennis at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong." The winner-take-500 euros a ticket for going in January in Las Vegas at the world championships of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a calm person; this subtle game to drink and reserved computer, these two behaviors do not really well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years, seeks to have fun, to walk away from the boring, which will result in the future.
The pleasure to play in Las Vegas is not in its projects in January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange sense," he says.
"The homeland is so far and I have not employment."
Finally: his girlfriend waiting already in Auckland, "in less than two, she earned her desired job as project event, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of the gloomy prospects in the country, two of the three sisters Tanner tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin now occupies a position of computer consultant in London.
Young people go: most of the families who live on the island are similar to that of tan.
The experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100000 Irish are preparing to leave their country.
They include a number of 200000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents an enormous loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a scale comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a great comfort, grief is now taking place.
The economic crisis, however, especially among the young, well-trained Irish, who have known until now that moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published widely readers letters written by young emigrants who complain: "in Ireland, is going to the dogs."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but one that has the potential, will and our country and an entire generation."
"The last to leave extinguished light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of Irish students, is pointing a bleak future because the government does that pull the wool over the eyes and offers no future for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the young student 20 years ago.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to a practicum without pay to another.
She said that his greatest concern is to emigrate itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon trying to positively address this issue.
McLarnon organizes the show "WorkingAbroadExpo" which provides a full support on "working abroad."
"But the work abroad is new to the profession a tremendous opportunity to take the first steps in the levels of the hierarchy," said the manager.
Its Web site shows photos of Web surfers in Australia and surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: to work abroad is not a boat, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O 'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland for the engineer of 29, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just fate of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hanover and Berlin.
Meanwhile, O 'Donovan visited rarely his native country, because it is involved in a position of additional work, in order to be able to complete to repay the loan agreed to build a house at home.
"The situation is already a little bonkers," he says on the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I am earning money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I am almost more."
He broke out of an embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with gardens of good care, expensive car brands are stationed on the access roads.
Four years ago, O 'Donovan had purchased the house in common with her sister for $380000 euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
"They were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Did he fear that any collapse because of the credit?
O 'Donovan thinks for a moment, to be used hot tea and said: "I do not have children and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The engineer of the building does not like the wailing that he often heard lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as it was once lived here on the island," he says.
" Working for a time abroad, this is not what can happen worse, perhaps it is the fact that we felt first Irish.
He laughs and then spoke of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"It was back after seven years, and in Ireland, life continues."
The idea appeals to Cian does this Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his record, it already has a few years of work in London, which is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still something that worried these days: to organize its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into evening farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says, drinking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it is still worrying."
"Call it instead an evening of goodbye, relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as to private enterprise.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two elements are the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 percent per year since 2002, support for democracy has gone from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 percent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34 percent said they had confidence in the European Parliament in their countries and 45 percent in their government, the same as last year, in both cases, but in a strong increase compared to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If it was held during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries experienced only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, 32 per cent).
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more unusual in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see table 5).
About 31 per cent say they or their family have been the victim of a crime during the past year; however, this figure is down from 38 percent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71 percent of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56 per cent in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58 percent believe that the market economy is the only system that will make them developed countries, compared with 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62 percent of respondents in Venezuela are of the opinion (and 80 percent said the private company); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, down 11 percent from last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela has this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A soiled vote
No one expected to have general elections perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the affected countries and plunged into the fear.
It was submitted ballot boxes and a new election, ballots scattered in the goutières, polling stations and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many of Hatïens, including many who have been displaced following the earthquake in January, roamed the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, have denounced the fraud and have called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they do not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily had invalidated the process ."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which opponents are indebted to René Préval, outgoing president unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Célestin should announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round expected is planned for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, which has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250000 identity cards needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians are themselves.
The toes to the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernandez, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, more than 50 per cent, its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet, turn this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, visibly in mourning, that it would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, the predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs are still confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has resulted in the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
Ms. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement to power have rallied to Ms. Fernandez.
But after chaotic (where a parliamentarian has hit in the face of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to compete," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented in the next year, leaving the president greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1 per cent, but many private estimates and the wage demands of the unions, the figure is close to 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made it a priority to growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
He has refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted the falsification of statistics on inflation.
Ms. Fernandez can now moderating these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by high world prices for agricultural exports to Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernandez shows signs of wanting to restore the financial relationships of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring forced debt, Argentina had not paid its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernandez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which resembles a prelude of sanitation INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernandez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When the Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it has receded.
If it wants to win another election, it will have to decide whether or not to repudiate without noise, many policies of her husband.
A half-go to China
The Taiwanese public are is oriented towards a closer union with the mainland.
What is that Taiwan thinks of his older brother, on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters have been presented on 27 November, which is 70 per cent of eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in the context of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for the feelings from the continent, have developed innovative business links, including a pact partial exchange, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five mayoralties, he failed to win a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has turned to the complete independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes cast for the KMT to 45 per cent.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of the vote of his party has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event was unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including trucks splashy campaign flags of mass gathering with girls danced in minimum.
An assassination attempt mandatory mysterious has also been committed.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, toured electors for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, injuring him and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it has not been determined whether the shooter wanted to do harm to Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-'wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have Lunn with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid dressing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also has failed to fan the flames of anti-Chinese sentiment.
That is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese firms are vital to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, has claimed responsibility for confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
We can expect that the Beijing government continues to provide commercial facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan, to return home.
China lost no time to send a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on the protection of investments and cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see a political integration, but let us start at the beginning.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has in any way reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was bad: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, it was a provocative in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderate began under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he, too, can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that the talks can be held without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the public of Taiwan that his party has a "trustworthy alternative" compared to the hasty approach Mr. Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to seek the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP will be difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
It is important that the KMT is introspection.
Assessments of Mr. Ma were low; despite a dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his firm and its local branches will be revised.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already happened."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: the Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category of "best new artist"
Performing at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist and singer 26 picked by President Obama to occur at the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of " best new artist.
Considering that Spalding is a very well-known figure in jazz since her album of 2008, " " Esperanza, the appointment remains somewhat mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not leave more than three albums before registration, which establishes the public identity of the artist. "
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," was certainly a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly engaging, clever pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line to Spalding compared to the tremendous success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voters of the Grammy Awards, taking into account the jazz productions in this category in recent years.

Trombone Shorty, favourite in the hoarseness of New Orleans and frequent guest "treme" HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; bending also strongly towards some merger with albums Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the set, has won a few well-deserved recognition in the large category together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose album "pathways" of its octet"s live was a fine example of the democratic ownership bassist as group leader.

The draft of the mosque in Temecula won the approval of the planning commission.
A proposed mosque in Temecula has received the unanimous support of the local commission planning after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project, arguing that it was promoting both of terrorism that traffic jams.
But the commissioners have ruled Wednesday night that the new religious centre complied with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support the: Christian, Jewish, Baha 'is, you say," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They were just very strong voice."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6.00 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, with most of the time, people calling for or against the centre, the speaking time almost equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's Web site.
"There is no more," wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet monkeys with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of 135 families co-exist without incident in the Riverside County for years, but she wanted more space and better than the warehouse was used on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque 24.943 square feet in the Mediterranean-style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet.
It would be a site of 4.32 hectares on Nicolas road about two miles east of the Lycée Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against the project to the City Council.
A tolerant microbe arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life opportunities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, with arsenic."
" That is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a form of real life " foreign, " said Paul C.W. Davies of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the newspaper Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, which did not disclose the details of the discovery, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, agencies may be able to use other elements to activate the biochemistry and that the" standard "elements that we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of global scientific research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrologie NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; it has speculated that a microbe exposed to two substances may be able to substitute one to the other.
Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus. "
"As a result, the agencies are struggling to distinguish these components separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different that it doesn't exactly as phosphorus; he got inside and, in some way, gum of our biochemical machine," said Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and were exposed to increasing levels of arsenic in which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that he can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that some form of life using arsenic can occur naturally or elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was more common in the early days of the Earth, she said; for example, the researchers have hypothesized that the first forms of life would have been able to use it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just how life on Earth was formed at the beginning, " said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs stolen have been found in Compton
The other two dogs exhibit on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, sheriffs Los Angeles County have announced Thursday.
The four dogs of exposure - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are good," said Whitmore.
"They are in good form."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dog had been found in any neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We do not want to say," Whitmore has said.
"We are following orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a commentary on Thursday.
They were met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals in the county in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found the truck and two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a male 3 years of age, and Didi, one of 10 months - were unharmed, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competition this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs were missing until they were discovered Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend in the national championat "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they intended to submit Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions to other events planned in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba," said Peek in the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the judgments of the exhibition tour canine almost a month of the couple.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and park their truck outside, next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy Boxer, Parson Russell terrier and a épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they have left the Akitas and corgis, thicker fur in the van where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows, so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the truck at 6.00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted for identification.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to be ashamed of the restructuring of MGM is awaiting the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, officially praised Thursday the "pre-packaged" by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be wiped out, paving the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the bankruptcy code of the United States, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover afloat under the tutelage of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the managing directors of what will be a studio Lite.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the outset.
MGM will not emerge really Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not have a credit facility of $500 million, expected to fund the new operations and MGM productions.
It is being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is itself facing $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. has been hired to advise the leadership on how to put its finances since it did not have the means to pay the interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio have taken much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, at the end of 2009, putting the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders from which no one was willing to pay $2 billion of which creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to remake everything while MGM team had started work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, has finally been approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fate of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received 1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Companies of Cooper, who have collected $375000 per month for their management of the company, will receive a bonus "success" of 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account restart production of MGM, which has released only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would graduate from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265000,000 out and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of the debt of MGM, has tried to achieve a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment studio, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift balanced budget
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed perhaps by the system of video game from Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a significant hole in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 jump ropes classic pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" us and Wholesale Club BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more force; at the same price or a little less compared to last year.
In addition, while there is generally less new toys associated with Web sites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, are more tender.
And toys to button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys of the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press on the belly.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second to deal a song.
If you buy several, they sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you can no longer stop you.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Based on the technology of Elmo Live last year, the animatronique doll 14 inches plays games in turn as Simon Says and can make the lunar dance through his feet innovative articulated with wheel lock.
Children who have essyaé toy uses Mickey as a dance instructor, while their parents complain of a lack of control over the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember to Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a rucksack full of game cards questionnaire designed to transform a ride in a car in a session with a self-correction and a binder of valves.
If you are suspicious when your child is your smartphone, three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech ($60 for 3 to 8 years) is the cheaper and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
Neither version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL Fisher-Price ($90 for 3 to 7 years) uses a system of iTunes type to provide electronic games and books and has an entry for SD card, which allows to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks before the time lag, it is ideal for a spelling contest.
Increasingly, the toys have a sort of online connection.
On the basis of their presence in the toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online Club Penguin, for example, you can obtain a Penguin Disney Club 2 " mix Match Figure N Pack, $5 for ages 6 to 12), which includes a room marked a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit to the Club Penguin store for two articles in the choice.
It may be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10 for 5 years and older) is the latest micro-robots button cell.
The false bestiole moves quickly on 12 pasta vibrant silicone in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary shift in the mouth of our dog.
A softer side to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait a place in the city as an urban a sergeant training inspecting severely its nerve loads, emitting low voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - large public officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Are you right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, " he said, " what are the nice girls! "
Four girls who barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and trousers identical color olive, figeaient at you.
Four pairs of shoes black heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly perched at the top of hair tied in a knot striped blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are nice."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of urban inspectors to China.
A city has required that all new recruits have a degree higher.
Guangdong Province has exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called blue more engaging.
Wuhan in central China, has replaced the down-the-eyes by strong-arm: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded a trolley uncontrollable snack through black eyes, strongly for half an hour, until the street hawker packed up their affairs and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its police Street in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, curve and their young age.
The idea is to give the police not roughly trimmed a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might be difficult to attract the eyes on this underground urban brigade of China
And for good reason, critics say.
Unlike the police, these agents are only permitted to enforce the municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the Hubei province was beaten to death by an observer after he used his mobile phone to film the train to disperse a protest against a landfill waste.
Last year, a training manual for the inspectors in Beijing, stolen and posted online, outlines how effectively overcome offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a street hawker of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, Chinese inspectors trained to street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," said last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversial tactics.
The newspaper called for a "genuine full cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is very far.
After that the district has spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, questioned whether the women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The announcement of the district required female candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years, having a nice silhouette and "five facial features in good order."
They should be larger than the average of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The 26-year retirement is mandatory.
Officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
"It is the image that is important," said a military officer of the Rednet.com district, a Web site, quasi-governmental.
"First, the external candidate qualifications will determine whether they agree; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
The women of the Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: " in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management office of the district of the city, did not agree with that description.
But he noted that the requirements for the height were standard in many job offers Chinese for both sexes.
Such is the case with the requirement on the order of facial features.
That means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, the disabled or disfigured need not apply.
"We cannot allow a person who box or bossu come here," Zheng said.
"It would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrol the place Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 and has the pommelées cheeks with a finely mouth curved.
It did not consider the value of its appearance as sexist, " she said.
"Do you think I am sexy air in this uniform?" She asked a disillusioned.
Xu Yang, his colleague to dimples 21-year-old said: "our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their mandate is limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply drive the sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen vendors rapidly moving on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much as possible of buns or tofu bowls before escaping.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already said several times!," Ms. Xu said then that a seller had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-noodle cart.
Officials describe their rather monotonous functions.
"It is about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They can only threaten to report violators to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread of false rumours that the agents of the chengguan had killed a seller.
In a night, more than a dozen police officers and the chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang, where the female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers seized a motorbike that was being repaired on the sidewalk, rather than in a store, such as the regulation.
The owner of the motorbike shouted to the scandal.
A 15-minute followed before the police, face grim, found its way to shooting elbow to their vehicle and parties with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years ago, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
As the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain an oil image.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said Mr. Li said a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public who begins."
Prosecutors inculperont does not Senator Ensign
Prosecutors from the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to an assistant of a former campaign and its efforts to obtain lobbying for the woman's husband, announced Wednesday, lawyers for the senator.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case to make headlines national last year, and damage to his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of an investigation a year ago.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate ethics committee.
Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had informed "Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from comment.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, under which there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign have conspired to violate a federal ban on lobbying.
Interviews and e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in connection with the case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer in a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of donors policies to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then he defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law of lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case appears to be in contradiction with the prohibition of the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the Justice Department has refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks received high-level by its section of the public integrity, including the decision last year to dismiss the case against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of prosecutorial misconduct.
The federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take up arms, " said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the lead lawyer for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received on Monday a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department did not seek charges against his client.
The team of lawyers from Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated Wednesday in a press release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments that he had made to the prosecution.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Commission on Elections decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96000 by parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission has said that it was not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign Mr. Hampton helped find work for lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "has continuously signalled" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of the transport of a meeting in the name of the airline after Mr. Hampton lobbying.
When the news of the case have surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator had hoped that the ethics committee would quickly the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, " she says.
The appeal of Cheshire discussed to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were in the process of typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three family members of Cheshire, Connecticut, should lead to a formal end when the judge would impose the death penalty, which was passed by the board.
But the lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already present to the court describing the appeal of the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense coverage of the trial - as well as widespread use and extended by journalists Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," a widespread and instantaneous saturation with incendiary details that the board had been badly affected by the passions of the public.
The request could push the appeal judges to debate on the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"I have experience at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms infringes on the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, their answers rejected the claims in the judgment last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board would have been driven by the passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
The appeals courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States quashed the conviction of a osteopaths Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere of the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts to review a half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the means of communication of courtrooms, imagined at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general right to worry about the impact of new media" in the trials of large-scale, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the School of Law at Stanford who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says that some appeals judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instant communication from courtrooms could allow more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many described by Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; what is delaying the execution.
Defence lawyers also argue that, for example, Mr. Hayes would have suffered a loss when the Blue judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of the potential jurors their showing grisly photos of crime scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years ago.
Defence lawyers say they are also challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge had unfairly expelled one juror, who had been critical to prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual step of bringing the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month that the case dominated the media in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They have maintained that the computer media continued to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The scramble daily tweets media cameras and journalists to the courthouse," wrote the lawyers, "resembled nothing of what has been seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the cover of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that the new instant were more incendiary releases recovered more slowly, was a luddiste which would impoverish the policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that the appellate courts tested often attracted by the arguments that the social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes insisted on that claim.
In their case, they are a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of media coverage of the trial and they said they invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21 century."
Civility can bridge the divide?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory time prior to the rapid return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress did not produce any breakthrough on the key issues that need to be addressed during the session of the "lame duck."
But clearly, there was at least a polite discussion of the differences of the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern rather than another episode in which each side wanted to score empty points. rating point supporter.
The public meeting Wednesday of the Committee on the president's deficit has been equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months created a mutual respect across the ideological divide, but which, however, still divides members.
It is barely sufficient to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and put to the test in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting Tuesday, and the subsequent comments of participants unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or the rights, the two sides are miles away.
However, the November election had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the tone," said Pete Wehner, a member of the Bush administration, now with the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
" It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are partisan passions, and then they estomptent.
That is good. "
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the session "lame duck," Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the meeting Tuesday at the White House, more flat optimism on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "new START."
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warns that a successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "lame duck" does not necessarily lead to better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be made will be psychology in the short term will revert to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed widespread scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
" I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing in relation to the main event in 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the commission's deficit which include reform of the code of taxation and increase some taxes, to push the retirement age and reduce costs.
The co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes at the commission, composed of 18 members to make their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have struggled to reach this number.
The most resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that there is on tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come in the next year in the form of partisan battles, given that the Republican contest Obama budget, taxes and health care; to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, when the two parties will observe carefully the reaction of the public.
That will be judged in loss should change course and find a compromise.
But it is nonetheless an optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be more ideological gap between Obama and the Republican Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on issues that divide them.
American released documents describe Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a kleptocracy and put up a party to the Kremlin of bribes and money of protection that it collects, reported the United States Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, " he said.
They are raising money not only to legitimate businesses, but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - the money will go to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was mailed Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names were redacted.
It was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there has since been little evidence of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years, and he won several libel trial on those charges.
In September, he said in a Russian television channel, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "it is crazy, that is, it is anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an account of embassy; and it is incredible that this would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to name the " dysfunctional " and that the government functioned more as a kleptocracy that a government, " according to the notes of the embassy.
" The criminal elements have a " krysha " (a term used in the criminal world/the mafia, which literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world in Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an inefficient system in which the criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB of money larger companies and that the police targeted small.
A source, he said, "explained that business owners Moscow understood that it was better to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups), because they have more weapons, more resources and more power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"This is the reason for the request for protection by criminal gangs is not as high."
The note said that, although the money is extended protection itself can be uneven, and even those who pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly saw their business close on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly referred to the fight against corruption, but he admitted the lack of progress.
The note to the embassy sends accounts of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, up to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank" Indem Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, costs of corruption, across the whole of Russia, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the countries are ranked the least corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, which was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of resolving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN Larry King, Putin has suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be manufactured and reacted with anger to the remarks that diplomats of the United States had disclosed the appellant Batman and bringing Medvedev Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the director of secondary school Anlong Veng referred to the man who had built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here like Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader, and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42-year-old.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality, when he was the head of the Khmer Rouge, Commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the loyalty of long-standing is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims to respond publicly to the people who had participated in the scheme.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, which for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, made his first award for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch."
In this evolving situation, anxiety has increased among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating the reconciliation efforts and their wishes to be reintegrated into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
They have launched an insurgency that has lasted until the last movements visit in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters Khmer Rouge began defecting to the government, culminating with the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most veterans of the Khmer Rouge have sunk into abject poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia; and many of those who remain nostalgic.
Although some officers elite Khmer Rouge have kept their posts in local leader in exchange for having laid down their arms, it is not qualified farmers low rank and file.
"These people have received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a framework in which to do business is a foreign concept."
Lim, a 55-year-old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused worries here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith another former Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the tribunal to try senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes but has not said if he went beyond these four cases.
It would be in addition to allay fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, it said researchers from the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that it had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers were killed.
At a recent torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field next to his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the grass parched, Im Chaem refused to discuss its past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she said, it would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had defected Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would happen if the court was continuing several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
" Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms to reconnect the broken pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "a History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It was distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite links to the city to the regime.
Valeak Touch, 19-year-old student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court continue."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation, complex and difficult, " said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court is beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful: here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a road, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot covered with a tin roof rusty.
The body of Pol Pot was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, age 31, selling mobile phone at roadside, said that she did not know much about the man who has been burned at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea, and later that day, it had planned to walk towards the final resting place of Pol Pot, where it would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of a chance.
Belarus agrees to waive its stockpile weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential ingredient for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory for the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was met by Foreign Minister of Belarus Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to desist from highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the approximately 500 books, according to an official who spoke about the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations, organized at the initiative of Obama; when Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to get an invitation to the ex-Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear security summit in 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group of promotion of nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have made under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the summit on nuclear security, Obama, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never turn away from its uranium.
"We kept of highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially a weapons-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Lukashenko.
"It is our product... We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are going to sell it to anyone."
"We are going to use it for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago; however, showing interest to reach an agreement.
The first to remove uranium from Belarus in October, has been particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded onto a special train that ran more than 1300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented in order to build confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy specializing in reducing the global threat.
According to estimates by the Center for Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus this year at least 88 pounds of uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Lukashenko on Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations, and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government had no objection to the CIA flights
The government had no objection to the CIA flights with prisoners Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership in Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered (cable) by Wikileaks in daily El Pais, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish executive is informed "pouvoir' demonstrate that they had a proper vigilance on foreign aircraft passing through Spain."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe who accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between the former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the government of Zapatero offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "take us unawares," said Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Ministry of External this time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this case profile as low as possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence."
In turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was sent to the embassy that he would not block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Centre for Intelligence (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating element, no sensitive information," said the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States have shown their own concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish and German prosecutors" to déclassifiée information CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to move the case quietly between the Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch meeting between the ambassador of the United States and the internal Minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff "to avoid the comments of an overheated rhetoric, trying to declined temperature."
The ambassador also expressed its concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"In spite of his pro-American general direction, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be construed as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she noted.

The members of the Popular Party would win four seats in the Congress and the CHP would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies in the last elections autonomous, Catalan PP has already targeted the general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, because the number of votes that this training received in these comices normally double that it receives in Catalan.
Thus, the Catalan folk have obtained 610473 votes in the 2008 general, while the autonomous in 2006, they received 316222.
On Sunday, the CPP won 384091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired a diversion of votes of the CHP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that there would be general elections, the CPP could increased from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also four (it now has 10) and CHP would lose no more and no less than 9 (25).
These calculations would see that the Catalan is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular ERC would lose a member - he has three now - while COLI keep an MP or gain.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for the municipal comices, where the popular may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and relays at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations handling the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists as the popular agreed with the CHP could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the Socialists would gain the majority rather than the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and COLI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, there would be no fantasy that this training lost its representation in the municipality of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5 percent of the vote.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital city of Tarragona, where they have governed with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to CHP, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy, during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
The popular recorded progress also in other important municipes Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to train for a maximum number of locations.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
The seven inmates in Barcelona, in Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detainees by the General Information Commissioner of Police Barcelona formed a jihadist cell headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various groups Al Qaida, among which "the Tigers for the liberation of the Earth" (Tamil Tigers) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that " operation Kampai " was " feeble " the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda to international level and therefore its operative capacity ."
The investigators calculated that the cell in the two years during which it has been active in Catalonia, has been sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that incorporated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda for its "combatants" to move the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network operative in Europe, that is why in investigations participated in services Thai, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union could there be in the following days of similar coups in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with the operation, the Pakistanis were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand has been a different place, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was those who headed for Bangkok cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which has been hit in 2009 - was flying mainly tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the "front appointed Islamic World."
That is to say the documents should be name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45 years old, with a period of several years and without visas stamped.
Investigators stressed that so far has found no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Bombay, even if the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receiving stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before that the attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through an agency transfers a few miles of dollars have been invested " to buy mobile cards that were used by the integrative " commando " that killed 106 people.
Police grabbed extensive documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend the tax complicity
The CPP leader, Alicia Sanchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to explain personally to Artur Mas conditions to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those outlined during the campaign, which boil down to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignists adventures as complicity is economic nationalist leader to take up to half of its mandate.
The president of the Catalan popular arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 MEPs in the elections last Sunday, more than enough for love, as the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training that will exercise the oppositions refrain in the voting for the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan.
And the President of the PP, to support a "nomination should eliminate all separatists and pro-independence rhetoric," and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that converge leader wants to submit to a referendum.
The two leaders have in common is their bet to lose the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritance and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the nomination of Mas will on the part of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors ' Montserrat.
Mas met with Joaquim Nadal (CHP), which has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (COLI) and today he will do with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly
The geriatric The Caritat of Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage done to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 older people that he was responsible in the meantime it has worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala came accompanied by the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the" responsible for the deaths, but "the legality and we must take the situation continuation of civilian officials."
And the discredited social entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the nurse at night, the biggest threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation as the legal representatives of the victims ' relatives already calculated.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009, and from that day has not ceased to kill.
The judge said in sentencing that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric care - the suspicion that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of patients, the procedure was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday that situation and noted that "the lack of measures may have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer for The Caritat added that "in this case there is only one indication of negligence on the part of any person other than the accused."
The person already dubbed as "the Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that it was the first crime committed on 29 August 2009, and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it has caused the death by injecting a sober-dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedatives pellets.
The director of The Caritat referred to the fact that it is difficult to control access to medicines.
The insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of the house, used to kill them.
But the laboratory tests will clarify if Vila do not lie in saying that he has sought for his first victims a less cruel death or otherwise it has burned inside doing laundry as it has already admitted that he has done with the three women killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the declarations of the nurse at night, the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is higher and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after committing successfully eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of Trichet yesterday, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The incremental peripherals have closed the strength and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5 per cent.
However, we must not underestimate the capacity of the ECB to be wrong and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a conscious signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same manner as he falls, he recovers, but motivated by fences short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor soon to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB gave us today to withdraw liquidity measures, and it will retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and those that remain.
Bundesbank required the finalization of the plan to purchase public debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope to extend the current liquidity measures "until at least March" and maintain the auction quarterly to unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the programme of buying bonds and even give the signal to intensify.
If they do not carry out the expectations, they will overturn the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to remove liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their meeting in May in which they said they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they have collapsé markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday, he said he had already bought a lot in a collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% from $750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
Ireland was published figures hole Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10000 million short-term and 15000 potential and they have until February to secure private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after it had not detected the problem in July with the test stress, the figures are assumables Plan of assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget, and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore remains Ireland in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate tone of his speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that all of us interpret the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president has had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action that the Council of Ministers approve Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment ring the gills of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market has been 4.5 percent, double that of the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and surprise.
Today there is an auction key obligation to three years will be debt by Trichet, therefore we hope that it can be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40000 million in available liquidity, the triple compared to March, with very expensive types and cut access to markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of the Caesar's wife, "to be issued."
Courage, we can get out!
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm did not end in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because it considers the no "right," the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, sought by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize control of the management of the firm's owner Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his son Jesus David and José María give their legal battery for the new chapter in their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not seem to be willing to cede in the dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of her seven sons who were appointed directors in the shareholders ' meeting of 18 January this year, whose challenge is registered in the Register of Trade and corporations.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrat Number 2 Madrid, opened the new box tonnerres within the family Álverez.
The appeal to the judge for setting the assembly, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate remedies applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural quibbling, clearly defrauding the Act and by taking advantage of the law, validate and correct the radically zero assembly on 18 January," according to its official words.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting takes place, is being challenged by considering that it is "null and void."
The same actors, who maintained a discreet silence, have tried without success that the judge convened a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage society and Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group seeks nevertheless usufruct 51 per cent of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of protest for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull es entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this rareﬁed niche universe of speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In a first time, no one has taken into account the options for a new stable arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they have bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the ability as a pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car in the world of Formula 1 the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful software simulation process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of the high automobilistique competition.
Appointed PLM, this powerful instrument was used to create chains of assembly plants that everyone, energy, high-precision instruments.
The goal is reproduce accurately simulate the product or process before the construction of a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, Sukhoi or most famous commercial vehicles Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, said the fact that the use of this instrument technology in its factory Formula 1 Red Bull has helped to create and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams, which was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
Team Red Bull today are 180 young professionals of high qualification, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and project any kind of changes on the fireballs.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the fireballs Red Bull except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
It amends the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes may move from the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development, there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team may spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has introduced the high-tech factory to create and produce its fireballs in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that is happening there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty account 580 people, including two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1, Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the vast technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden actors, whose work is invaluable and zero visibility.
The director of technology for the plant, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago, it could be argued that the R + D's progress in the case of racing cars brought the 50 per cent of victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85 per cent of success, while pilots are the 15 per cent of the value-added.
Nevey says the Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."

The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona is the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.

Sabadell bet on stealing a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, think 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war's liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a breakdown of interest margins, will attempt to partially compensate with increments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell look a million in three years of specific customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to operate in the future three years and thus be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will set in motion in 2011 a new master plan that will be a will lability of three years.
The goal, to survive without need to resort to public subsidies FROB is to earn a rating of market uptake of a million new customers individuals - 700000 excluding those who can break the bank, its great task, because until now the bank had spoiled more SMEs and the companies that the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250000 individual customers and 50000 companies.
Its rating of the market is 3.5 per cent, while companies it exceeds the 10 per cent.
Another plan 2011-2013 is a gamble on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the cost reduction target, including provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set goals and the public, because the financial crisis has upset all the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, to finalize this year its master plan, Optima establishes there is four years, even if the original plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a year.
Clients who leak savings funds will be its main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by FIPA, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a difficult year and transcendental. "
The executive, in fact, believe that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be very difficult to create jobs, " which is essential for the survival of the bank case, insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war liabilities - which penalizes the margins - reduced the price of risk premiums that banks and funds to pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity already move in the price of credit to offset the decline in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We did not close the tap, but differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price differentials - see CincoDías 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now is to increase the commissions, " but " there is a competitive framework. "
The master plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that Spain "will be larger dimensions."
"Everything will happen next year," said.
It argues that the capital needs of "increase dramatically" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he noted that the FROB can replace the market in the diversion of funds in the case of new recapitalization.
After that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He said that it cannot issue, but rather to what happened in June, can be obtained from the short-term financing through rest, easing the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among unions
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and re-emphasized the speed with which to execute the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings funds began, there have been several entities that have ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d savings (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the merger was completed, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica a second phase, adjustments."
"Most has been completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but all major process have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who has worked a lot in this operation," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of executives and Exécutifs of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is "the greatest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied with the way that it is within the time frame that was set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé.
"The passage of 45 funds with average assets of $28500 million volume at 17 with 75500 million is a trial without equal in history, by reducing the number of entities by 62 per cent for much larger to comply with Basel," said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of relatively positive opinions about the slowness of the process" that show a "lack of sero-status and meaning," because "the Bank of Spain is reminder that we must respect the time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system all Europe and "probably" of the world, and he attributed to people who are "a lack of knowledge."
The leader said that given the current economic situation, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector is well stress tests that ECB made in July.

Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but he lays down the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Tensions markets have led to a government response doble.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of 426 euros in aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% AENA, airport management of Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of Loteries State.
Another, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president Felipe González, joins criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel in regard to its responsibility to remove the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, upset with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European opposition, Germany are beginning to speculate on the three possible exit of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the mark, even though it now appears to be science fiction, with a very favourable opinion, almost a 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for a more macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines for countries that transgress the possible suspension of payments and extension to the private sector cost adjustments.
The German position is clear and so long as it is, therefore, now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF, such as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of a discrepancy between what Germany felt that there should be (fiscal rigour and stability of public finances and its European partners, including France.
The second of the Central European countries was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
At that time it has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel reiterates a clear position, calling for the reform treaty of the European Union to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time the private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This has been interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis, and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should see the process of reform of the Union is possible these measures from 2013.
Germany drew a red line that it did not believe cross.
And it tells us that, even if we must take measures with which it may not be too agree, from the date the former functioning of the euro would be finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries who break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default, and in this case, the private sector to bear a cost advantage.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external surpluses.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who presided over the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The development is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear.
It is not only to extend the public deficit to 3 percent in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And it must not be done in these circumstances is fooling ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil are arriving to us greater tranquillity.
And they know to take the opportunity that we have been given until the spring of 2013.
It appears that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and its dual statement (the reforms promised after the meeting Saturday with large companies and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it opened the way to the thesis that it has to be at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they do not seem to move.
And among the possibilities being considered, we cannot exclude that abandoning a monetary zone too packed with little serious country.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that she had warned.
Sport and fraud law
The tricks are similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity, but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion woven in principle by two players from Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has been extensively chronicled on the anti-sporting nature of such behaviour and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before closing the game that their team was already clearly), the two players have deliberately lost time when they have misbehaved to determine the arbitrator to show their second yellow card.
As well, and the fact that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will accomplish the regulatory sanction in the next game of the match against Auxerre and can pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA has punished with two games the team coach, Jose Mourinho and are economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as these or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, rules non-written, but followed the sport.
Part of the debate in the case related to the fact that this was a team player entity of Real Madrid, which in its anthem displays the nobility and honor and in previous occasions has fined his players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode in his dilated history of histrionique technician and provocative.
In any case, the debate asked whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the resolution contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, if with committing fraud bill; because they are friendly with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to look at the type of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
One of the property, which includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, something that, with these actions have not been put in danger, that is to say, there has been no violent game.
Another of these assets which alluded to the correct play is avoid the team players offenders benefit unfairly from the team, which is not the case.
However, the paradoxical result of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that she is not happy with what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud law, because its violation of the rules has not been conducted in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has just tried to be as clear as possible to receive the criminalization of the arbitrator.
They expected and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefits that offenders get the meaning misconduct discussed.
Here it seems necessary to see that it is not in a situation of disadvantage to rival and has an advantage in the same game, because obviously the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club could not count on these players.
Of course, the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cartons that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a certain degree of vagueness, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and with this action, the players are doing a match penalty and move to the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cardboard with a less than in the first round.
So, climb the ladder, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part of the strategic decisions that support the full advantage of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the punishment (this would be a clear case of fraud the law), otherwise they have chosen the time in which they are subjected to it.
They took a strategic decision without defeat the penalty or flee.
Even if the border between engineering and fraud law is diffuse, in this opportunity, I think it was a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, I think it is because of two factors: because there were two self-evictions and how to convey the Director for the cause.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much as ethics aesthetic.
Offensive offered to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the concentrated schedule this year an avalanche of bookings for days, 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-celebration by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat, and all the lottery, when December may also return the dinner before Christmas which continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive te adjusted prices to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, are businessmen and industry associations.
To complete complicate the accounting, the timing of this year (such as the New Year's Eve falls Friday) has concentrated applications in the week of December 13, with up to an avalanche of booking dinners for the peak days (17-17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees hold of their own pockets.
No matter what is the situation, they are all price battle, confirms the president's Gremi Restauració Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers now do not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People consider much before."
"They want to get out, but they pay much attention to the price," he says.
The case will go well "for those who provide quality at the right price and with a good service," he says, and recalls that clients tend to go down a level with the crisis, so that the group around EUR 25 became the majority in the application.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is a real boom in applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus, with complete forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the schedule has assumed more bookings, even at the beginning of the month of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices for the past year, with menus for all tastes of 19.95 at EUR 30" detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local remains optimistic after detected an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business opportunities for Christmas.
Sources of the group noted that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day in groups of friends who are celebrating in advance of the holiday season.
Their six menus group they have added to the noël, with 30 euros or more famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10 per cent more than in the past year, instead of requiring more details, such as the Catalan wine produced by the method ' Champagne-type ' - ' cava.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
By the Fecasarm employers (which includes entities such as the Association of bars, restaurants and Barcelona, his vice president, Enric Gomà, says in the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "lively," even if customers "negotiate."
This is true, the hope that the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, " he says.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produced atomic weapons "to a faster pace than any other country."
The leaching of Wikileaks confirmed the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the Department of the State of the United States filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous preoccupation in Washington, the Pakistani nuclear program.
The flare and tasty details available on the content of the conversations and thoughts of diplomatic North American representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents show that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian countries producing nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The distinctive feature of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make it difficult for them to destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
It is as well as the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials that short and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is planned, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan's staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline of educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who worked in the nuclear and missile programmes," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Ministry of External during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange cooperation increasingly reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistan production de armas.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues that: "transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, said that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also request to Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to be understood "very clearly" responsible "that the Pakistan Army must end with the tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera a high responsible for counter-terrorism to prevent further infiltrations.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and to locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements of" Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a traditional arrest.
In addition, it is not new, but the date of November 20.
And it has nothing to even with the latest filtration for more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
20, the international police body with its headquarters in Lyon, France has led to calls from Sweden, but it has not made public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries Interpol received an indication to identify or locate Assange "for his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol could not give the order to arrest a person affected by a red alert, many among the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a free way to arrest - that the National Police must achieve - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where we think Assange.
The movement has outraged lawyers of Assange, who yesterday issued a letter dénonceant that Wikileaks founder of 39 years, has shown itself willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also point out that Assange has sought and obtained a permit to break Sweden's prosecutor, as compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world looks - and Australia, his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown location, but he was not.
On Monday he gave at an undetermined location an interview with the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the secretary of the State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates that they épient at the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the Press Secretary to the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" resignation demand.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a guy with a Web page should be of interest to us," said to CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior official of the anti-terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The test of the spokesman of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, Congressman who in January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the Department of State that it was studying the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to any person who provide their contributions or assistance."
Further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, who has come back on his statements after said that Assange will be murdered. "
"Obama should transform the goal and use an unmanned or something similar."
A person who has not requested an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"In the Government, which has been leaked information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with clinker at followers of Carod
The Republican leader will help the party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more diverse and the end of the system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for resolving the umpteenth internal revolt within the ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware of the fact that its threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, but at the same time, he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted his liar and that it cannot give him headaches that he had with other common extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will earn its new criticism with clinker look that allow it to shield up to municipal elections.
For a start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
Through the ballot box, not in your hand.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote of penalising the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks to avoid the image of division and submission.
In several interviews he said he did not consider ratified with more than half the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, as a result, "the Bulgarian" would be a good thing.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than put its position of militancy, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós control body maxim between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to register with the executive a roadmap until May.
For that, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of scheduling the congress in the fall of 2011, the leaders see as a safe.
The ERC leader admitted that the "polyphonie" affects the stability and that its goal is to once and for all, the organization is capable of laundry room in the family.
In this line that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if was.
And he listed five, he stressed.
The first, "mend" the Executive is at least 90 per cent of the militancy, that is to say, include new figures from the sector Carod follower.
The second may be the character of a new high.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statute that allows the achievement of the congress through delegates elected by the electorate.
Finish with the model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team Puigcercós, who fought in this direction in the last two Congresses.
In fact, the convulsing conclave of 2008 has instructed the leadership to revise the model assembly in a special congress of reform of the constitution.
This meeting is unfinished, because the internal tide of recent years did not address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors to watch, it might be good for the resume and close forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in the COP16 assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce up to 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its emissions of greenhouse gases.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 percent its emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020, assured Su Wei, a representative of the country to the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (§C§O§P§1§6§), Su Wei assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, explained it, the last four years his country switched $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, it has clearly stated that China will not change its targets, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He said that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; building; construction of institutions and support for pilot programs.
There has been progress in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the goals raised with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the governmental and local to achieve the objectives of saving energy, energy efficiency and reduce emissions.
In addition, said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, has mentioned it, the program to use Efficiente Energy, which has been implemented during the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.

For example, explained, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historic contribution to the contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase 20 percent energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar to 2020, said.
Legal eviction of Espino: Cesar Nava
The national leader of NPOA detailed that the former leader paniste has the right to apply to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
The national leader of PAN, Cesar Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former leader paniste has the right to apply to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
In the interview prior to the decision to protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Commission to Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to speak, if necessary, by making a claim to the Commission to the National Council, so that it is a decision of a competent organ," he says.
On the other hand, he was informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that Accion Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections next December 4 and 5, which is expected to elect a successor.
"It (an alliance in 2012) is something that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, this was an approach for the local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," said.
The leader paniste mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why " internal competition does not daunt us; on the contrary, " we relish and makes us stronger, " said.
He said that without a doubt the board will élégir the best leader/e whose Accion Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would be "to the person determined by the board."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of chairman of the party to any of the five."
It was expected that the recovery recorded by the party in the past elections on 4 July will be pondering the next argument, even if "it is not the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is to accompany the governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason to comment throughout the country, so that there was "a lot of hopes, and I am sure that Gabíno will live up to the expectations."
When asked about the PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during its four years of government, Cesar Nava asked priistes to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari administrations.
"If the PRI think governments Zedillo Salinas were better than those of Fox Calderón there; they begin to defend; they come out of the closet," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Government may make expressions such as he did in his speech to the National Audience, because in the country, there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Act Dream Act, drew silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is meeting today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act Act to legalize the undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Act Dream Act, drew silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama.
His short message is keeping open a cyber link with a further document that asks the public to immediately contact the senators, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the financing of government continue.
Such a freeze, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Act Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking the Act Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved will set a agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must solve the tax problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment in this direction, and then we will be able to plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would seek a "vote to close debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize the undocumented students could be passed from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be the next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the Law of American dreaming would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years, they remained in the last five years, and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education, or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, in times when partisan project players intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of which support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican has expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act requires the votes of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most Republicans courted the Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who has completed the mandate su Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they would not support another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported John McCain, has not defined its position so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act in the Senate.
With the literature is the nail on the head
The second phase of Safe language was a walk in which participants flaunted the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand that, but... the nail on the head? Hopefully me?" Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of Safe language, a cycle that famous literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for another show the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained).
The nail on the head... "puts us in embarrassment," said gently Argentine writer to the public, most young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderate by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a leader who seeks to know what is the "wound," it goes from one doctor to another, without a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
The infectiologue it fate convinced: "patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist/has cut the breath in the middle of the corridor, but explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst reveals that the mystery: "the wound is open in reality, the symbolic scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "the wound I have only been able to know that it is open and that it does not exist," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a beautiful narrative that he called Praise to the invention, where the nail on the head is not ' Number but at a given time.
With overtones of magical realism, he spoke of a famous ensorceleuse affecting clouds, return people who were gone or repaired virtues that damoiselle had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the big news has been from the beginning its own columnists and cited in Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who criticizes the excesses of the narratives capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes we invented (writers) was ridiculed false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre manner would never be narrated the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the assault."
Nevertheless, pointed out, "the crazy and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know how much of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction reached its peak.
It is called the ' tradition of Cervantes '.
"It is through his legacy that is storytelling."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations, caused by the invitation of the FIL with the round table on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rico has put his own on the great wound of social violence that his country is going through - and Latin America share - product disputes the traffics and sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," said, after just the reality of the literature is communication and the size of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction."
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also pointed out "this is on the wound of the writer committed."
It found that in a world that lives in high speed also relate to the intellectual habits and the awareness that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind each statement there is a small and behind each deny there is a small, yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of the reality we must qualify: and nuance means a great deal of time put the nail on the head and disturb people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in black and white, established ideas and without nuance and disturb the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to recover the meaning to write.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in concluding there were ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive set.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles, marked by their technicians, who found them a marked contrast in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive set, although so far it has not put in the mile, and that is why this is a very special occasion for him.
The Argentine eventually console themselves with the medal sub-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The santiste strategist arrived at its first final as a entraineur in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which it has lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; the Closing 2003 also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna in the Tournament Bicentennial 2010, against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered a new setback, because his team has done an equal match 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in a series of penalties he obtained an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of its players have missed 11 metres and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two concluding with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he is trying to detach the curse to celebrate a title for the first time, although it says that the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, it is a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I have mentioned before is more important," said helmsman when asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers much of the last final, which he said that he had learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players, too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I think that is a lesson, before the end of the match we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concerned, because it gives his players: "it never tries to arrive at a series of penalties, we are trying to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have that we prepare the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny has given us a disservice, sometimes it is the emotions or anxiety to keep the title in our hands, we escaped, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity not to be a technician sub-champion and taste glory for the first time under the titles.

14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in the Eastern Townships, Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that have been used in the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used in the production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Surete du Quebec.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including two leaders alleged the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the courthouse Sherbrooke within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is information received from the public which has enabled us to make such arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional survey module Estrie the Surete du Quebec, the Police Service of Sherbrooke and police Memphrémagog, took part in this operation.
Illegal migration will continue without any problem
The draft law of conservatives who, according to the government, should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten, while the three opposition parties have indicated Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am relying heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to one year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that it could not support the bill, because it is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NDP immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that his party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats have agreed to take measures against smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill conservatives because it deals with refugees and imprisoning children for at least a year," said Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians overwhelmingly say that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," the minister responded Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could lead the country to elections in its rejection.
A conservative, however, said the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote for every member who oppose is then explained to the electorate.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry into the matter.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York about this last January.
The city has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement was a surprise.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on policing of Quebec, on 29 October last year, has never been discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was for the Parti québecois critical public safety, Stephane Bergeron, describes this announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution cobbled together on the corner of a table."
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it, simply to say that."
"We are aware of this problem."
The chairman of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create such a commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he says.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest," explains to Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, it suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate to the auditor general to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"You must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he says.
He also believes that Quebec could provide the auditor, the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in cartons of Charest government.
Quebec also would ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague of Justice Rob Nicholson, is currently working on some amendments relating to this matter.
At the Spring 2001 operation, the biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not suitable, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently been Act gangsterism.

The CCNR judge that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language which is not suitable for broadcast during the day."

The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative portrayal of Haitians.
"I have already served my suspension of three days."
"My record is blank for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM has worked "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among other things, announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.

She said that "this would be the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a limited alliance in the time that allows two or more companies to consolidate their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain has a high level of complexity, given the magnitude of the work.
The site is under way and should take until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition to act; there have been negotiations.
Also, the formula consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed in the last week, Le Devoir, form consortiums of engineering is the subject of an investigation into government.
A quick overview of the business register Quebec counted more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single corporation, Dessau.
In terms of energy consortium stewardship, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay meets dynamic workforce specific and Hydro-Quebec responds in particular since the 1970s."
The big boss of the Eastmain, Réal Laporte, Power Corporation's James Bay (SEBJ), gave an explanation that frowned on the fact that the contract of stewardship of the project has been granted.
"If you are going in tendering, and there are few bidders, prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take people who are in this market and you say: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium stewardship Energy is part of a long list of contracts over $50000 obtained by the Parti Quebecois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts consulting engineering awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, including laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin swept 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention his participation in 'Énergie stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They account for 449783,344, including the contract to Energy Stewardship 295131 $564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms "finance," before specifying that it was more of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer québécois very little confidence in the players of sustainable development, but also the fair marks and écologisantes certifications to guide its choice.
Worse, even if it is bathed in a media universe where the messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, he regretted a lack of credible information that he calls even brake its commitment, says the Baromètre responsible consumption, including the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers, however, seem to be very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies like the green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of all consumers questioned the reliability of official certifications affixed to the so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of the products and brands displayed as Schools, said the Baromètre.
In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on the theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
Information responsible consumption, however, seems crucial to stimulate this pan consumption currently hosted by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient the ardour of 46 per cent of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Baromètre after the higher commodity prices.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are also wary of alleged performance of green products or services that it seeks to put their hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to change their habit and especially changed to mark one or more products to meet their conviction.
61%, they have also helped purchases with traders in their neighborhood and preferred food grown in their region, said the Baromètre.
More green and keeper index responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 this year, the consumus Homo Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by concern for the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological conscience, however, appears to remain on the outside of his car, said the Baromètre: in 2010, only 28 percent of Quebecers reported having used public transportation or advocated carpooling to defend their interests.
Walking and cycling have also been supported by 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging inquiry, which has just taken its first cliché.
A loan from the state for the redemption of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, has been asked to commit themselves financially in the redemption of the cinema complex eXcentris Corporation Angus and the Parallel, agree to cooperate, but to a loan.
The development corporation Angus and the Parallel, who had hoped a donation of $7 million of the Ministry of Culture to redeem Daniel Langlois complex eXcentris film on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in restoring its full cinéphilique vocation, do not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to become involved in the issue, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government proposed a loan, the amount would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on favourable terms, at least in the view of the sources from the headquarters of the state.
An initial action plan and a request for $12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, but the applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action have been sent to the St-Pierre minister by the president of the Society of Business Development culturelles, François Macerola, pilot's record eXcentris.
He sent a final report there was a period of 10 days.
But the proposal's office came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it appears that the assumption of the gift of the state really must be ruled out.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and Quebec cinéparcs opposes a direct investment to support the redemption of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has failed to finance real estate projects, it has not been done for other theatres.
But several stakeholders claimed a substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master here, has for 10 years to of cinema in the premises of the complex after itself financed its construction, which could justify a waiver from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to build its clientele.
The Society Angus and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, leading, for their part, a campaign of private funding, hoping to collect $700000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to distribute films eXcentris.
The purpose of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February by projecting the beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Des men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is not clear what he and his group believe proposals downward.
The veil lifted a complexed Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States consider the inferiority complex of Canadians toward the Americans, but they betray the sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voters have no Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that the visit of President Obama supported the Conservative government to get its budget in 2009.
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, D.C., over the public yesterday, offer more titbits that substantial content to eat.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in full federal election campaign, recounted how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"An inferiority complex perhaps almost inherent determines the Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of the day, rather than to focus this election on the United States (as in the campaign on the free exchange of 1988)," he wrote.
The United States is, therefore, he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
Ambassador includes less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, and even more of a party leader to manage this vital relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
Another expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent by the 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, chargé d 'affaires in Ottawa, preparing for President Barack Obama in his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, under which Canada will record its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being ousted by the coalition and the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC refer the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-Fly-List" or kidnapping for interrogation by the CIA.
Another cable reported that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some of the prisoners at Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner has answered yes, but on the basis of the "case-by-case basis."
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "it has submitted a paper to the secretary of state about Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
Finally, people are getting worked up about the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser to very close to Stephen Harper said on CBC that the head of this mass exodus should be "murdered."
He was echoed by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renovate the domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which is almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs still monopolize from 50 to 70 percent of the market were replaced by fluorescent light bulbs, or better, by light bulbs to light-emitting diodes (LED or "LED"), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GHG emissions on the planet to illuminate the humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8 percent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should increase overall GHG emissions of 53 Gt 49 Gt.
But it will take from this assessment yet 5 Gt in order to stabilize the increase by 2020 climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95 percent of the energy dissipates as heat and the remaining 5 per cent, a product of the light.
With fluorescent light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75 percent and with the new LED bulbs, reduces the need for energy twice more.
The fluorescent lamps last an average of 6000 to 10000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that launched the manufacturer Philips this week - the company has also participated in the study of the United Nations, have a life expectancy of 25000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to making very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several experts have shown reservations to fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury, and should be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions in the world is not the CFL bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through this program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion per year in purchasing power and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction cost 2.5 billion.
Cote d 'Ivoire looks in nervousness the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "without delay" publication of the results of the presidential election in Cote d 'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce interim results without further delay, pointed to a spokesman for the head of the United Nations."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to act responsibly and to refrain from any action until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of midnight Wednesday without publishing results, three days after the voting on Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the chairman of the CIS had said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council "floaters" in the north, held by the former rebel New Forces (FN) since the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president to go out and vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are selected by the Constitutional Council.
However, opponents of Gbagbo felt that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N 'Dré as the new, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, North denies any link with the former rebels, said it was "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it is not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country still divided into two for years.
The UN warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round on October 31, with 38 percent of the vote against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bedie (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France under the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7 per cent in counting the overseas departments), showed the seasonally adjusted data (CVS) interim published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolitan France.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3 percent of the active population in metropolitan France and 9.7 per cent with the overseas departments.
A year ago, the unemployment rate is displayed an increase of 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work and that they are seeking employment.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate increased to 24.2% (+ 0.9 percentage points over three months, + 0.5 point in a year) and 25% by including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the ILO.
Older people have experienced a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% (+ 0.2 points over three months and a year), 482000 people aged 50 or more, and 6.6 per cent with the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years stability of unemployment in the third quarter, to $8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 percentage point in three months, + 0.1 point in a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE no longer publishes monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced Tuesday, a rate of 9.8 per cent for France (DOM) in October after 9.9 per cent in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, leader of companies waste treatment and brother of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhone, was indicted and detained at the prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guérini was indicted for misuse of public funds, embezzlement of public funds and assets, concealment, bribery, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, said his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wishes to explain all the issues that the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to continue for a multitude of leaders, it is another thing to prove," told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, prior to the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS in the department, Jean-Noel Guérini held, through his lawyers, the judge before hearing a memo to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been placed under investigation Wednesday night and detained.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything to operate landfills that he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or destination of funds related to their operation, he never had knowledge, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel pinna, former General Director of the town of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with a prohibition on meeting the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts."
"The investigating judge took into account not depriving them of their liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann 'Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on Tuesday night to Wednesday, and placed under judicial control for two of them, " said deputy public prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General to the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence peddling and passive corruption."
Two officials from the town of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted for "embezzlement and diversion of public property by a person responsible for a public service mission," the other for "complicity in misuse of public funds."
Finally, the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been under investigation for "concealment of misuse of public funds."
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets related to Corsica.
Investigators suspect that his companies have been used to launder money in organized crime.
The survey is conducted within the framework of several judicial information against X in April 2009 in the wake of anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement, especially in the waste stream.
A source close to the investigation, the investigation focused in particular on the conditions and operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which collects the Aubagne waste as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," held opinion in France, diplomacy, and has contributed to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give their advice for the treatment of their own crises "hostages" in Iran, a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman had not been for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the United States for smuggling of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under a harsh light the way in which the French presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic cable written in Paris on August 12, 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostage-taking."
The adviser to the Elysée for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d 'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talking with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their nationals forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "martelez ever" in the media, the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
It has to be to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more that the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because past attempts to discussions by discreet channels, "silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics."
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners "is a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He said that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, when she takes refuge at the Embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians for a large sum of money" (230000 euros).
And he pointed out that the Elysée anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest of some 1800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the United States are demanding extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, as many observers wondered about this troubling coincidence.
In Washington, D.C., stalking the clandestine networks Iranian acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only has "been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There has been heated exchanges between the French presidency and the Keeper of the Seals" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government may not return to the court decision," says.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close monitoring" French intelligence services.
The adviser to the Elysée composed a phone number, clutching, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is sparing no effort, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator."
The Americans are watching this activity without irony, and found that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press reflected the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the media blitz of French official."
What is the basis of both "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their full statements of praise, the French official privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually."
The document then examines the reasons that led the pay in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," analysis.
A policy launched in 2008, "which had been seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeservedly criminalised."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria what praise it can attract in playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted to him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked anyway."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cinderella" that will prohibit adolescents to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play in these games all night and then have problems in school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental official in charge of the bill.
The online games will be available again at 6 o 'clock in the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, " he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time for daily access to these games for young people whose parents are in demand, " said the manager.
It will also make available to people who are calling for the free software that can reduce the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" and newspapers regularly report various facts relating to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, faced with 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: the Fifa means organizers countries
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa means Thursday organizers country World Cups 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice where struggles for influence and lobbying could overshadow the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of Queen competition of the Fifa will take place in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (4: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium.
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia, after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its location in the United States or in the Far East, Japan, South Korea).
The list of leading delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is a measure of economic and political issues of the World Cup.
The backroom dealings are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the assessment report of the Fifa, English, Spanish-Portuguese files (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which hosted the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC was given a layer, Monday, releasing a documentary pin three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What is upsetting the Fifa and embarrass the French officials, who are engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of the government hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for the London Olympic Games 2012.
This intense activity will be enough to improve the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its ready stages, his expertise (World-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal and its football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal are only increasing the symbol of Russia, which has become an outsider weight despite the shortcomings of his record (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in an allusion to thinly veiled accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"The mud, trying to undermine the," Mr Putin has launched.
For 2022, the United States, the experience of 1994, appear to be the logical favourite.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the major sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a head start on Japan and South Korea, who have built separately a beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that have co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of World-2026 to China, eagerly welcomed by the Fifa, which would void the Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, which has lifted the great game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, the Fifa will continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries have more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights (because of the time difference) by European countries, the sinews of war for the Fifa.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had been led to believe that he was reluctant.
Valery Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate at the Elysée deserves another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix well with the mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then, as if the doubt still existed.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that it would take its decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011."
He speaks in front of UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" therefore has caused a bit of volatility.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was a long way.
The president was only recall that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of quinquennia.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential on the tone of humour at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you have yet to seven and a half years with me," he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "do not believe that I am not in the next stage."
His remarks before yesterday do not make it more candidate until the day before; they do not make it less.
If they are comments, it is a dual purpose.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination to the PS.
But it is not the substitution of Segolene Royal grows Nicolas Sarkozy to come forward.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS want a battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% 44%, according to BVA-L 'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there was no discussion at the UMP," immediately and cautiously reacted the Premier's entourage.
"If it believes the possible defeat, it will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year should be an opportunity to clarify the terms of crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations must be achèver at the end of the year.
Sovereign debt crisis requires European mints Frankfurt will probably not afford to be as compelling as only worsen a situation more than tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the Minister of Finance French, Christine Lagarde, and praised the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of the states in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, such as increasing its purchase program sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thinking to my European partners."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been more disert about its intentions, simply stating that the program to purchase government securities on the secondary market "continued," and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB have doubled in the last week, nearly $1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem, bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, expectations of further purchases, there is no doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect significant change of course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter still benefit unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for periods of between one week to three months.
Economists now expect the scheme to be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it significantly changes his program."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist with Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates its side Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the market for public debt, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to facilitate a sluggish market," said Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of exhibitions of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no other choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It is vital to substitute for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a runaway yields paid by the most fragile states," reflected an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are soaring, the states will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
The preservation of the euro is the price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is riding
After the beginning of the week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little bit relaxed, yesterday, with the decline in bond rates to 10 years.
A return to the uneasy calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of region have heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "puzzled" and expect a weekend "unpredictable," that he was then denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the long German rates had reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of the contracts of hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "greatly concerned" by the "turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third euro-zone economy, is not like Greece and Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and weak tax revenues that go with it, putting the state may not be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1.1 per cent in 2011 and to 1.4 per cent in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate panel on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent.
In these circumstances, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit would still 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9 per cent forecast by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumours of a new budget package that could be put in place after the holidays, for a total of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will be taken," said the Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, nor in the short or long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011], the stabilization efforts required to Italy are lower than those in other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held in late March.
Has a little time for a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of anti-crisis
Christine Lagarde has been hammered yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "the Europeans, I think it has been demonstrated on Sunday in the day and into the night, of course, are united, determined, committed to defend their currencies and monetary zone."
Although any relative relaxation registered yesterday on the bonds of European state has provided grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it would degrade the note of the debt of Portugal, the most target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Even more than "political time is much slower than the time."
Aware of this gap and dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers in the G20 are going well.
And also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures of support for countries in the euro zone in the bull market (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore, a tour of Asia to inform investors Far Eastern developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly is preparing the ground.
The first securities of EFSF are planned next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative assigned to the Reuters news agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds raised by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
The countries that are in the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to the austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path to those of Greece and Ireland.
Both were anxious to avoid requesting international aid before putting in place their own budgetary adjustments and decide on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
The European donors, finally, talking on the options available to speed up the process of normalization of markets sovereign bonds.
Crossing in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had initially suggested that if the 750 billion euros raised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union will not hesitate to call the portfolio.
Economists from Barclays Capital, one of the leading market of sovereign debt, consider that an increase of about 100 billion euros would be enough, " preferably in the form of direct injection of cash.
The vehicle is: it is the European financial stabilization, to date, 60 billion euros.
A board that is likely to be considered carefully in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snow episodes still create traffic problems, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and the potential to disrupt economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Two-Sèvres and Vienna were added to the 20 already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon, and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, flurries supported affect the north of the Gironde and Charente and low snow on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm on time from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and 1-3, and up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes of armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow episodes are significant enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt certain economic activities, prevents weather France.
In the Côtes of Armor, several county have been closed to heavy weight of more than 7.5 tonnes, whose Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult in the gendarmes who recommend not to take his vehicle in case of need and the movement of some TER buses was suspended for the day.
School transport has been prohibited for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific action was envisaged Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel Thursday, 25 percent of their flights on the Paris airport Roissy and 10 per cent to Orly because of snow to come.
The DGAC recommends for air passengers to contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Subway Grand Paris: first outlines financial
Since the time that the debate over the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions rained down.
In the discussion.
It referred in particular to 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro must build the Society of Greater Paris.
To start this GSP, the state has announced an investment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical framework, this sum will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets a portion of the funding of his double loop.
Today, it is finally the first additions.
The amendment to the finance 2010, discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices intended to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and an increase in the tax offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, " states the text of the bill, 15, is " for the benefit of the Society of Greater Paris. "
It is said: "the proceeds of this tax is $117 million euros per year."
The second is a redevelopment tax offices that already exists "to modernize the increase in the product and to allocate the increase to the Grand Paris."
This would bring.
Mystery.
This is not specified in the text.
It is far from the $4 billion.
"It is clear that these tax resources in addition to the $4 billion of investment, which will be raised by the state and brought to the Grand Paris as project," read the statement of reasons.
The GSP is not shocking.
"From the moment it created revenue (the two taxes, should be), you can cover the studies of three years and then type in the 4 billion after, explains it."
"This will be included in the budget and fired as."
The SGP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 to 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still on hold, may cause a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting on 7 December.
The vengeful hackers and spies diligence
The case of Wikileaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal before the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it promises profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each record established by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the profile eerily caricature of Gaddafi was long for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that the secret files must be that new already known is essential to the dynamic of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore esoteric publications, you will see that each book again (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Frankish Lusignans or Rose-Cross) exactly what was already written in the earlier books.
And not only because the author of hidden texts do not like to unpublished research (or does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to the occultisme only believe in what they already know and reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited) the head of the secret services (otherwise it could be that I do not know, editor at Liberation), which is not true that what he acknowledges.
The top information secret Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these issues have done so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any cultivated person already knows that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of states may call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few small exercises representation, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer film investigation knows this, and it is only through hypocrisy that pretending to ignore it.
However, the repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal is not in crisis victims as "executioners."
But the very nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of Orwell, you could see power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely proven since that can monitor every movement through telephone, each transaction, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye.
But when it shows, as it does now, that even the crypt of the secrets of power cannot escape the scrutiny of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be a one-way and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as vengeful citizen can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the option of retaining its own secrets can it take?
It is true, George Simmel said that a real secret is a secret (and secret vacuum can never be disclosed); it is true, too, that know everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret secret, because in the public domain, but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secret means to remove any power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has been too much to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very potent power?
It is clear that in the future, states can no longer make any line - this would publish it on a poster at the corner of the street.
But it is equally clear that with the current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state has shifted and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future the private reports and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is the science-fiction and is fiction, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who move discreetly in stagecoaches to uncontrollable routes, carry that message learned by heart or, at most, by hiding the few written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in drawers locked: basically, the attempted espionage Watergate has had less success that WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now crab, it is backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has restored a telegram on son (telephone).
The videos (analog) had allowed researchers film to explore a film not not going forwards and backwards and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CD (digital) do that to skip chapter in chapter, that is to say, by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we are going from Rome to Milan in three hours, while air and that it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not extraordinary that the political and communications technologies in return for horse-drawn carriages.
A final observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what is brewing in the secrecy of embassies.
Now, it is the embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France quick fix its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the observance of pledges quickly released (so-called fast start and early funding) made by the developed countries.
And the big French cobble something together are revealed.
The Copenhagen agreement, developed countries are committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged $7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros ($420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has lifted the great game to persuade its partners to the reality of its commitment to funding fast start: report detailing the work of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of leaflets...
The transaction transparency is welcome and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU have emerged in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which is on the way to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money should be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what is meant by "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
The European Commission has, for example, regarded as the reference year 2009: international funding are maintained, and she adds $150 million over three years to finance fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the funding of all "new projects" in the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the spending of previous years or the overall level of official development assistance.
In practical terms, the total amount of support from France to developing countries may remain stable or even fall), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding..."
Another crucial element, the division between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 lent is equivalent to 1.
Of course, it is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are cost-effective (often projects related to the reduction of emissions, which are based on more effective technologies), it is misleading to submit a euro that will be recouped as equivalent to a euro that is given to ... Any more, should be counted as part of its commitments that the cost of the loan to the lender countries (the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has no need of such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment to 420 million euros by 91.5 per cent of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check yourself.
It is the only EU country to use if the massive loan.
Germany needs to 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other) meet their commitments with 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is 1 to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Joli sleight of hand!
In summary, in its funding start fast, France operates a double scam: on the evolution of the action in the time and the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it suggests that it spends $420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Department of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy which has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other member states would continue to give it enough to pay?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is only a small issue, on the short term, compared to the whole discussion on the climate.
But it might be a grain of sand in the vast machine of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Nevertheless, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in the way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect its commitments and equity, with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on issues of long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently being discussed: it will not escape the question of "additionality" or the accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope, therefore, is the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward with the discussions.
Warning to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests a day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published Wednesday of Generations Futures Association (ex- Movement for Rights and respect for future generations.
The association, which warned that its results "do not have significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem," purchased between July and September foods generally consumed four meals and a snack in one day by a child for a decade, in supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These types, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, as well as sweets, were reviewed by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The results of the base is damning: 81 chemical substances which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five carcinogenic substances classified some and 37 substances that act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to cause cancer, as well as some 20 residue that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack in the study, shows signs of six chemical substances with a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, canned tuna, and even the loaves of bread and chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residue detected and even base plastic used to heat the meal in the microwave was not free.
The final risk to consumers of this "cocktails" contaminant "is probably an underestimate," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-The Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study by the European Agency for Food Security (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
