Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road planner, that the highways are facing a shortage of money for improving the system, there are many people see the solution in the small black box, which is fit from the washing on the dashboard of your car.
This device, the motor vehicle run by the driver each mile to the track and to transmit the information to officers, the main roads of America today have been old for nutrition to finance the restoration of the system to Washington and the issue has become a controversial effort for state planning office.
Usually as boring highways planning work also suddenly became the issue of intensive debate and lively alliances.
You have to drive by miles, and perhaps drive the details of the location and then use this information for the tax bill prepared to allow the government to use the black box with the Libreteriin for support in favour of environmental groups.
Tea Party Bhachkrki.
American citizen freedom took different types of privacy issues the Union is very concerned.
While Congress could not agree on this point is that the action or not, many can't wait for state.
How are they doing this search that in the next decade they can be from a system in which drivers on the road, fixed payment for each mile.
Thousands of motor drivers took the first to test drive the black box, in which some Ji.Pi.Isx Monitrng.
This object is really essential for our country.
"This is not the subject of our being selected or not selected by the Executive Director of the Union," it says the South California Hassan Ikhraata government fixed each mile by the year 2025 in california motor drivers to the start of the track to creating the scheme.
By our changes in the way of the payment.
For it to technology.
This is the main reason for this is that the country's Finance Trust fund was almost bankrupt, which is up from the payment of taxes on gas pump by American citizens.
Before the American people now buy the gas.
Now a car is already more miles in gallons of gas.
There was no gain in the last 20 years in federal tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallons.
Due to the high price of gas politicians avoid a dime to increase in tax.
Transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, "says Lee Muonikh gas and not just Snvhaniy."
His state has recently for the per mile payment system to the test 500 cars in the tracking device.
He says, "in the longer term it will work in the form of the most reasonable option."
Wanis says it Maerlej-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this is the best urban liberals think, because this, for example the car to be changes in taxes, to change in ways that can help in reducing greenhouse gas and to reduce the jam.
The educational system while they are keen for the state of california Mhaatwakanrshi Service to complete global warming target set in the laws are being developed.
But home.come. Bill Shuster (R -PA), chairman of the Transport Committee also believes the black box the long-term option there.
-Foundation in independent sellers are also in favour of the per mile payment by the driver.
The vice-chairman of the Policy, Adrian Moore said, "is not only doing it in- which is being blind in well."
People are getting things that are more directly paid for it.
This campaign has also given support to two former U.S. transportation secretaries, who in his report in the year 2011 has the blessing of Congress to proceed in the direction of the per mile payment.
The U.S. Senate approved the test project of 90 million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars are lost.
But work on rural law- the concerns of the manufacturers, who were the representative of the people who go on daily work or too many miles to go in the city is to be abolished on the leadership of the House, the proposal on the spot.
However, many state and city self- B are forward in this direction.
This is the most keen region, who are the largest 5,000 drivers listed in the use of the country.
This driver soon Maerlej instead of the state gas tax to pay the fees.
Nevada has already completed initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
The illinois limited became may with the trucks on the base.
And with the I-95 East center alliance, which includes the state transport department (Mereelaand 17, including Pensilweniia, Virginia and Florida), this study of talking about how the implementation of this change are that they can.
This idea has found support in all places.
In Nevada, where the first 50 voluntary car drivers some time this device was imposed on cars, this thinking the driver was very impatient that the government can monitor his every step.
In Nevada Transport Department directed to the strategic management and task performance, "says Alauddin Khan Big Brother and major problem was the same kind of worry about the other things."
This is not something that people want.
The test E.Si.Al.Ioo. the Nevada, proceed with the full tracking device in the device was warned on its website: "these will be easier to change considerably."
The there is no need to develop large, Aprbndhniy technology model structure, which have spread from each person for the day to keep the record as inevitable.
Nevada to get from those in many states, the sustainable technology can help, which is trying to state how many miles per day this thing could get the details of that car is going where and what time, but it is not that he is running.
Khan said that if you can, so that people can feel more comfortable.
The search of this technology to the small California start-up called the true Maerlej have some state agencies.
This firm was not originally in the business of the state and to help the drivers.
This Ubharte was trying to enter the market in the auto insurance, which was to be paid on the basis of their Maerlej drivers.
But it is doing the test of the device, it's good, because it does not use the Ji.Pi.Isx to Yyojnakaron and provides very limited information is uploaded, by which time spacing on modem.
The main the true Maerlej rayon Morrison said, "if you do not track the speed of the people and their location, they will be more willing to opt in this way."
There are some big mistakes in the state of these initial programmes.
For doing very little to intervene less lavish and also the ways.
In Oregon, Nepal drivers are using to different options.
They can choose the device Ji.Pi.Isx with or without Ji.Pi.Esx.
The state can choose not to or from any device, but residents can choose to the fee set on the basis of the average miles set by.
Other places in the hope that device instead of the less and more worried by providing the citizens to be sold.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device, which will the facility pay the parking meter fees, "according to his drive for" insurance will provide, and which will create the speed of real time data collection from other drivers will be able to use motor drivers to avoid the traffic.
This has been mentioned, "motor driver in city planning document because it will attract for the participation of the benefits to be gained."
However, according to some to wonder that perhaps the transport Yyojnakaron miles for discussion on all the big distractions.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in San Fransisco Bay area said that growth in the gas tax and bankruptcy highways Trust fund can tackle the problem very easily.
The additional one-time or annual fees on the drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be the vehicle, which is a lot more gas so that they do not use their right of payment.
Commission's Legislative and the director of public affairs, Rand Rentshelr said, "when Aamoolchool for her work with aspirin, may need surgery."
If we do, millions of car drivers will be worried for their privacy and many other things.

The intelligence agency said in the statement, "the night Nsaxgov today sent email access for several hours during the pre-set update, which was not in the internal error was the cause."
Today evening will be the solution of this problem.
This claim is not true that this barrier, distributed denial of service [Di.Di.O.Esx] because of the attack.

The duty of Frontier Airlines Carey On Bbgej pattern like that
Carey On to store goods for the passengers on board his aircraft in Frontier Airlines to charge $100 for the scheme.
A Carey On in Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging for bags for $100 and it'll fly, the duty of the Liai$ 2 of coffee or soda can, however, that travelers said Wednesday it announced the whole box.
New Carey is, therefore, under the seat for on-duty Owrhaed bin bags in small bags will be free, however.
The Frontier said that is will charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers have to wait until they are on the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate in charge o' the rainbow said that the $100 fee in advance for the care to achieve.
"We don't want to charge it," he said.
The Airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid fees Bharai are doing as they can in the Carey-On Bbgej Owrhaed Sstbsh in box, this box means less often in place.
For a way to charge less for the passengers on board.
O' the rainbow said that this new charge is not really about raising money.
This is the place for the most loyal customers that Owrhaed about Frontier bin find rapidly became difficult.
Airbus passengers who don't have to buy the tickets in your website.
This means that because the next person in line to be a 100 dollars for the same bag, while a passenger in a line on Frontier Gate, can get a free bag.
O' the rainbow said that Frontier's website and check these processes is being changed to Gate before getting to know about the fees for ensuring passengers.
The new Frontier Carrie On fees will not start until the summer, though a date has not been set.
Travelers often express the discontent about Bbgej charges and other fees, but the airline prefer them.
He argued that money is spent, and the passenger service for designing Bbgej should want them to pay for it.
Many see the fees in the form of a signal of the Bbgej that many on Wall Street after the years of Airbus's charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel.
The most though not to Carey touched on bag fees.
The Spirit Airlines Inc. started for the first time, and partner Diskaooanter Carey on duty three years ago after the Allegiant Air.
The other airlines with such a duty is Hungary's Wizz Air, which Airbus consultant Jay Sorensen said, and the aid fees on track patterns.
He said that the Spirit Carrie On fee brings in $50 million a year in December 2011 the report estimated.
Sorensen, a former official has recently the midwest Airlines flight in the Spirit and passengers faced Carey on unusual bag fees on the gate, staking surprise.
"The boarding process which I had seen in his Airbus career was simple," he said.
I hope to see the teeth Peesna and out a gate on the war.
"The aircraft was full and he said that this lickety-split over."
Even Frontier Spirit' the $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice stands is the following.
Frontier Neknva that will take passengers soda or juice stands, they can put the whole box, and this will give for free coffee only once.
This will however give away water.
Us Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks products in 2008, but seven months later, he backtracked after the complaint and any other follow after the Airbus there.
If airlines do not buy directly from the Frontier's passenger, Carrie On the Frontier for fees charged to customers for their own website to his latest effort to run this step.
This kind of Airlines is to pay the Orbitz online travel sellers have sold $10 to $25 each for tickets.
That is why all the Airlines instead of through an online travel agency to buy directly from those people an incentive to run for passengers.
Frontier however, went further in this area.
In September many often flight miles from half the distance from which these people for those customers to buy from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday it trips to the miles Maerlej award reduced to 25 per cent.
So, will acquire a distance of 250 miles 1000 miles/ Frontier/bought from an online travel agency.
It is also that they only buy directly from the Frontier website allows passengers to choose their seat in advance.
The Frontier is a loyal base of customers in the city of his home in Denver, but it is less business and this money has been lost.
The 9 percent decline in revenue and its flight capacity has fallen by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results issued by corporate parent of Republic Airways Holdings Inc on Wednesday.
As part of the sale of the Airbus in the Frontier Finance are trying to decide.

The scientists and light on this subject between the antics and his mood in the tail of dogs that are concerned.
Previous research showed that happy dog right are more shake your tail (dog), while from the point of view of uneasy dog more shake your tail to the left.
But scientists now say the companion dog can identify the tail of this subtle distinction and can express their reaction on that.
This study the Journal Krnrt Baeyloji has been published in.
The professor from the University of Trento neuroscientist Georgia Welllrtigra said: "this is all well know in humans that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in a different manner in which the excitement generated the positive or negative feelings."
Here we attempted to see it in other species.
He also said that like humans, dogs in the right part of the brain the antics of the left hand and was responsible for the opposite order, and played two different roles in the Golarrddhon feelings.
For this to learn more about how dogs by other dogs unilateral the tail on the reaction, the researchers tracked the films of the other dogs look on animals.
He measured the throbbing in the heart of pet dogs and the analysis of their behavior.
We would it not perhaps more time to understand why one side so that his tail sometimes on the other hand is shaken.
Prof Welllrtigra said: "we have the dogs with the films presented for the deal with other issues in the realistic version or in the shadow -were in the picture, and we see the HuA of tail and tail can submit more left or right."
When the animals a stolid dog the right side (seen from the point of view of dogs) shake their tail, they are completely freely.
But when he tailed to change direction on the left side (seen from the point of view of) the dog again, the beating of his heart increased and restless."
According to Prof Welllrtigra they not think through the dog these antics were deliberately to communicate with each other.
Instead, they think that dogs that he has learned from his experience on what action should be worried about and what not.
He said: "if you have many other dogs get time, and if they are to continue a shake on their tail, it is more related to the practice, and at the right part presents behavior, you do the same reaction on the basis of the experience."
Researchers say that the conclusion of the owners, animal trainers and doctors can provide better information about the feelings of animals.
School of the University of Bristol Wetrneri Va. Fzelo, the dog behavior specialist John Bbredshoh told the guest that this is not the first study to check it is important that dogs left or right for the part or not.
Last year an aggressive dog to see the team of the University of Lincoln found that when dogs are around his head, left side and are happy to see his head on the right dog.
In other research, he said: "Italian Studies of the University of Victoria in Canada, when the robot left than the right tail the dog was ilae, but instead of being regurgitated the dog was more likely to close."
He said that this was because the difference in various studies in animals or robot dog films completely dog the dogs were not understood.
He explained that this is the way the study can help to the reaction of real dogs by dogs.
"While there is enough evidence from different mammals are found that the two parts of the brain used for different purposes, to receive more detailed information is still remaining and dog are no exception in this case," he said.
However, the is easily their behavior can be recorded, we think that this may not take more time to understand that he never on one side, sometimes on the other hand, why is his tail.
New research, it turns out that we all work with honesty and dedication during the morning.
To speak and not lie from a theft or deception as to think not in mind.
But is the change our minds and we put to one side the perfect evening is to go against the rules.
David Akcls of Harvard University and to researchers in the Research School of Business has many interesting facts.

For this Risrrchrs conducted two experiments.
He said the number of points on the computer screen to some people.
For instance, was to tell the people that point is more on the left or right side.
He said that if he will answer right instead of wrong answers to those taking part will be the money.
In this Edksperiment he used people seen that morning between 8 and 12 on the right answer and no mistake.
He found that people use the time between the 12 evening from 6 a.m. on niche and deliberately incorrect answers to their electorates.
This Risrrchrs proved to be the money no matter the greed from our honesty that morning, but the evening we closed the eyeballs to morality.

AAA: aircraft Yat.Rigan can now use the aircraft in gadget can (but not from cell phone call) 
To read the from aircraft into the passenger gate to gate, to work for, game play, movie watching, music listening to use his electronic device will enable but not be able to talk to your cell phone in this highly-Pooarrwanumanit new direction -under instructions issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn't expect the these changes immediately.
The AAA administrator Michael Huerta said in a news conference that these changes to how fast implementation is used, it will be different in each Airbus.
Airlines will have to Afxa.Ax this is the direction that their aircraft, complete with instructions on how the new direction, and to members of the team's training books and his driver for the device collection instructions for how to update the rules.
AAA said that it plans from some airlines for the extended to the use of portable electronic device on the aircraft already acquired.
Delta and Jetblwo are among the airlines, who are already presented plans.
The AAA said in a statement,"based on the status of the plan, we can very quickly approve the expanded use of electronic device.
At present, the passengers of aircraft need to close the door closed on his Ssmarrtfon, Tablet and other devices.
He is expected to be given permission by Captain by reaching an altitude of 10,000 feet and the aircraft as they do on.
It is expected that from the time they descended the aircraft to take off your device, and the aircraft completely again to do it on.
AAA said that, under the new direction instructions by the aircraft to airlines whose aircraft electronic interrupts his passengers are completely safe, they can give a, aircraft, flight time and the time of Tbksiing allowed to use the device.
Most of the new Airbus companies and other aircraft that are modified in this way the passengers can use the Wi-Fi on more height, they are expected to meet these standards.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Atenndenrt, Laura Glading has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "when will be the safe way the implementation of the policy and we will work together with the airlines for it to companies, it will win the thing for both parties."
When it comes to this issue, we do "Hall Monitrrs" as feeling-weary.
But the agency said that less than 10,000 feet height on the Internet, to connect only by email exchange to achieve, or to send a message, or download data to still be banned.
Ssmarrtfon, Tablet and other devices to passengers will be said to keep in Ayrpplen mode.
So will still be no conversation with friends, online Scrabble game, so as to famous event is that when in the year 2011 were actors Alec Baldwin, aircraft Park game on your Ssmarrtfon during the live on the door, and from the American airlines on the device close to him by his aircraft was off.
And still to be collection of heavy equipment such as laptop, because the other person in his cabin to be jumped to the concern of the injury.
Cellphone calls during the flight will also continue to be banned.
Phone calls related to Regulatory is right near the Federal Communications Commission, the AAA have not.
During the filling of the flight and the plane Afxa.Ax can remove restrictions on some electronic device.
Last month the National Transport Security System Mark Rojaenkn the CBA News national transportation safety expert, said that the cell phone is still considered risky.
Rosenker said,"cell phone are really serious issue, not only because it can generate interrupts in navigation- the device as possible, but also because it can generate disturbance in the cell phone tower in the air.
This issue constituted by AAA industry to check the advice the Committee has recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic device.
By using this ban on Afxa.Ax to less pressure has been increasing in recent years.
Sen. Clear Mbkkaskilk de Mo as critics said that prohibition is not a valid for security reasons.
The enforcement of these restrictions and also difficult to because the use of the device is so ubiquitous.
Some studies also it indicated that almost a third of passengers are forget or ignore the direction of their device to stop them.
The Afxa.Ax passengers in the year 1996, when passengers started to restrict the use of electronic device by A.M. radio and by the time the High Institute interrupts the report was received in the gadget due to navigation and communication equipment.
The Ilekttrikl system in comparison with the previous generation of the new airlines, aircraft companies, but they are also more dependent on electronic design for resistance to intervention and has been accepted by AAA.
Airlines are coming from passengers on the height Kcroojing Wi-Fi proposed the use for many years.
The aircraft modified for Wi-Fi system also interrupts for more resistance.
Huerta said that under the new guidelines most airlines companies should get more authentic on the qualifying standards for the use of the electronic device.
The time of today's electronic device, in comparison with the previous generation of electronic device emits very low power of Radio Ttransmishn.
For example, E Ridrrs, is very nominal Ttransmishn during the leafed page.
But do download data or send time by device Ttransmishn are strong.
To reduce the restrictions on the use of the device by passengers has in the side of users to Amazon.com.
In the year 2011 the company airlines all intended for the Amazon Kindle e-Ridrrs loaded and problems in the procedures for the test but found no such problem.
The device Afxa.Ax Advisory Committee has less mixed feelings about the risks from the use of the resource.
The National Union of Douglas learnt aircraft passengers said that they believe that risk is real, the resurrection from the device whether nominal only.
The other members of the Committee said that, in support of the Aircraft system to insert the device interrupted by the report only described by the pilot, most of whom are are very old.
However, the members of the Committee recommended that AAA that allow the pilot the aircraft in low visibility, to allow the time they ordered the passengers to close the device.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and the general knowledge of people who travel in them, the latest round of technology the facility said.
UA travel CEO of the Association Roger said that we do happiness that AAA has to recognize that this is not incompatible with the passenger to travel with Anand, defence and security.

The seat width dispute for jet manufacturers from the large orders at stake.
While the established rhythm for months for the Dubai Alrrsho dispute claims for a competition is the long distance between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of the tourist-class seats
A dispute resulting in the vimanas Eekonomi class which is focused on the width of the seat, but not always like to be given by the Arlaalns like to allocate space efficiency Letecst jet Yrbs SAS and the Boeing Company is claimed to be the key.
This this week Yrbs Eekonomi Kbin a seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the Industry Standard is expected but this should be set by the Arlaalns says of his main rival Boeing.
After the event of dispute between aircraft manufacturers then comes when 17E-21 were possible enter the long distance from the twin engine of large Vrrsn Erkrfrt in order to sell the race.
How the previous Department of the aircraft is made particularly whether Sihting Daauo of 9 or 10 equals more capacity being prepared in keeping Mini design of the Jumbo Jets?
It says the Boeing 777 "X" is made will the 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 people Eknamik in a line department.
The race with the Airbus says the A 350 will take in this 18 inch seat placed left 9 equal to 350 people.
The veteran often through the business press advertising in business impact on technical matters.
Now, more than 100 in Dubai Alrrsho with Airbus 777 X is expected to dominate the order, it will appeal to people.
This is being seen in recent Vigiiapn of anything that may be the beginning of the war the Finnnsero a with a with a three in restaurants, this show is it you accept?
Airbus sales chief John Leahy said "Boeing is introducing a long-distance flight" in regional Snkreesitoan than Trrbo.
In the form of change, people may have been large, but the way of the aircraft seat is not changed.

The average American man's waist 39X7 in the 21st century, according to the U.S. Health Statistics.

The Airbus says he established Research Commission which is an extra inch in seat width of 53 percent of the suggestions of improvement in the quality of sleep.
Boeing, Airbus dispute, and said that the manufacturers on the seat measuring the Aaankdfo is a balance between how the Airlines fares and was not dependent on the decision.
It also says, the research shows a more than the width of the seat depends on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver said that "it is really Jinbhevishwas on things in the Airbus to provide flexibility and that is what they need to succeed for this show."
"They want us to do this is the the benefits of them."
He know any better and in the comparison of their business.
This is about the elbow room for Flaiyrs, but this is an issue that can affect the income rapidly for the supplier.
Behind this dispute is in the order of business at least 700 billion dollars of U.S. and European export balance in the coming decades, enough to tip the competition.
What the typewriter told Ripoarrtne in July for the first time, the seat layout really Ldzaeeka issue between the new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed is Karydkcshta per seat 20 percent of their new twin Aanjin section of the leader in design, 365-seat Boeing 777,300 in comparison with the air.
The claim depends on the performance of Boeing than the 777 X 10 One with original design the 555,777 9.
The use of 10 equal with profit now than in unit costs.
"The Boeing says Kevin Keniston, the head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility and more seats for making it more competitive with our products, and their aircraft is doing to possession."
On the other hand, analysts say the 10-seat cabin per line for the current 777 S the dense layout in the side, along with the suggestion that many passengers with cheap fares can be.
My Bordoibam, founder and editor of the cabin expert said the network "seat width of 18 inch Rnwe girl will be great for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus business point 777 operated by the threat of it."
Supplier for Airbus and Boeing do not supply of seats but Airlines are providing a list to choose from.
Jet carefully measures the vendor also to check on this Leaawts competition all over the world.
Even more comfort, while all birds of low-cost airline travel and regional jet aircraft for high density, giving the Leaawts.
Equal, a 10 A 350 Airbus responding but says it is not yet sold.
Until recently, the Airbus facility has more cabin on the need for comprehensive emphasis on cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft.

Youth: be large quickly before time
Research shows that Hispanics and African-American girls of your age getting youth in Gori than in young girls.
This does not mean that youth near the physical changes.
This is no evidence that Harmon or any other chemicals may be to blame.
Experts believe that may be one of the causes of the obesity epidemic, youth in the age of.
Not before time youth as effective in the case of boys.
The former Si.An.An. reporter Pat Aiirij, an expert in children's health and family issues.
Whether the mother should be worried, if the hair of her daughter at the age of 7 or 8 years in the development of breasts and vagina started to go?
The American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference in Orlando, Florida this week in Pediatrics Lndokrainolojist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz confirmed that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, this new fashion show.
Kaplovitrj says, "I spent very little time in this faith to parents that usually shows this is not the full rapid progress in the direction of the youth."
To direct the development of symptoms like the blades of the breasts, hair and physical smell of female and Kaonkh girls in the time before.
But in the last four decades has been very little change in the age of the first monthly Rjodrrshn (religion).
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, 12X75 in the year 1970.
"When breast, in first Rjodrrshn are beginning to be developed at least two to three years," Kaplowitz says, that "girls in Time-East are also the author of youth: essential guide to deal with this common problem."
The development of youth is the most accurate test time.
What is the start of the youth, this debate is about, but when growth with breast growth before the age of 8 years is two called it "adult" hair.
This process will be slow in most cases can or will be stopped from which hair physician close inspection.
More rapid progress in the position by Anldokrainolojist may need to examine the possibilities of the serious problems like Ttyoomrs or Sissst could be overcome.
Pre-time monthly religion and other results to pre-treatment, for example: the time of the bones age, which may be anaa in the form of undeveloped growth and adult height growth.
Drug for treatment or Haormoan Snsstutiian, depends on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional need.
Psychological aspects are also important.
About Kaplovitqj drugs are conscious but cannot accept, by pressing the "youth Wyvaharaatmk issue, and girls can take to feel different from his colleagues."
The second big problem: not all parents want their daughter under the age to be understood monthly religion.
Kaplovitqj said, "how they worry about the risk of pregnancy, or that he has come from hygiene."

The parents of Inrtrseks Kids can choose their children's'gender Anirrdhariat'
Germany became the first country of the European Union, with which vague female birth for the third gender to provide recognition for the children.
Now the man or woman Rtdzigt way to children will not be specified.
According to the new law requires parents to declare such children for sex is not the birth of the child them, this law allows the evidence to declare the letter on gender' Anirrdhariat"or "unspecified."
The purpose of the new law for those parents to reduce the pressure that the newborn children can take in decisions related to gender-Nirdimtikrn Shalya medical urgency and Nntrseks to fight discrimination against children.
According to the BBC a Nntrseks years after the person said, "neither I man, not woman."
I made by doctors to make Jkhpmi, Stained limply.
According to estimates from each year 2,000 children in a child is that it is neither the boy or girl.
They are Nntrseks, part of the group of about 60 conditions, that the word comes under check, this group of disorders of sexual development, which is unusual chromosome Jnngrrnthi (ovary or testes), or abnormally developed used for sex.
It may seem that Wallis And Simpson Nntrseks.
The gender identity is still not properly considered, but most experts in the United States believes that when sex cannot be determined, gender is better to use the best available information and to specify Shalya therapy to inspect by bribing, if, before the child's psychological and physical development.
The New York City psychological expert Dr. Jack Dlreshr that the cases of gender-identity, he said that the new law of Germany "appears to be a good thing."
Nntrseks children produce moral dilemmas.
He said, "some people are in a position like life-crisis for which Shalya not medical need, but with most of the children."
You can specify the gender, and without Shalya therapy after to see how that identity is developed.
No kind of sex in a child, it will be developed to the science is not very accurate.
No person cannot answer about why that is.
This is a kind of puzzle that people are gay why.
In the year 2011 the Nntrseks Ttransseksual or the people in the report before the European Commission has been described as different from transgender people, because their status is not gender related but is related to its biological composition, which is not so clearly the man or woman but or so both United as any clearly defined from or in both.
These features can display secondary sexual traits, such as the weight of the muscles themselves, the hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sexual traits like breeding in part and female; or chromosomal structure and Haormoan.
This report Nntrseks and the discrimination faced by transgender people in the area of jobs, and at the same time also provides overview about harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Now with non-gender are the special camp for boys.
The Australia and Nepal adult people allowed to mark their man, woman or "third gender" on official documents already given.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Naqri Welllbi, the legal appeal for life- the "unspecified" sex status to receive recognition after winning the world's first "Lingghin" became the person.
According to the internal ministry, apart from the German passport in M or F Nntrseks third Nirdimtikrn will be in the form of X for people.
According to the report on the France 24 news, neighbouring country related to gender issues are still controversial in France.
In the year 2011, as the strict dozens of French law from the Catholic country manufacturers have signed a petition for the "gender theory" to go back to the books of the school.
The website of the U.S. Catholic online has also opposed the law, saying, "while the Germany is a state in the world, where gender itself is the option selected, but not sexual activity, we are taking in the opposite direction and two pillars of civilization."
Mereelaand said that the children at the time of the birth of the baby by the mother of the newborn child John will love to be specified gender.
He said, "without the additional limits on the website about bringing the Parvarish is very stressful, especially if you do not know what it is that the sex of your child."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, the children born with both male and female genital to the bisexual Hrmbfrodaits (hermaphrodite) said, which was the name of the beautiful Greek gods.
And about time less than a decade ago, the medical world that sex was considered in the form of the slate can be written and then deleted.
But now many people are giving Shalya the morality of the medical challenge, they understood that gender identity is complicated work, and sometimes mistake than doctors, who may not know that sex will feel about Nirdimtikrn whether your child on being large.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called" the emergency psychiatry" says Dlreshr.
When these children were born, so you were not called the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The female unclear about the treatment of children was presented by the existing principle to John Haapkinns University Dr. John Money, who believed that the sex was Sunirmaanniy.
He created the word "gender identity" and argued that the social and environmental signal- how do parents bringing children interact with the child's genes and hormones and determined that it should be recognized in the form of the man or woman in the form.
But the year 1966, in a case that became known as the "John/Joanne," his controversial theory.
He was a child, which eventually penis during sex Lingagrchrrm-Oochchedn (Srrkmsishn), the advice to parents that they allow full Bndhsy of the child and his testicle forest and it brought up like a girl.
Dreher said, "Money has presented in the form of the successful case of Awsthaanr, but it was not the case."
In the age of 15 years, the child married back changed in you as a man and a woman.
But in the age of 38 years, he committed suicide.
Yet Dlreshr said that some doctors are trying to "follow" the same model.
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the year 1990 started, the people who come in through these gender Shalya medical "not happy" with the result.
This was the case with the 36-year-old author of Mkntana Jim Bruce Aksxwaee., who was born with male chromosomes, but her vagina was unclear.
The doctors clearly didn't understand that his penis was small, or the Bhgshef large, but they were sure that he was never in the form of man can live life "not satisfied."
So the external part of the year, some time after his birth in 1976, Bruce and his testicle Shalya uprooted by medical and Parvarish the kind of girl.
The woman Haormoan in her 12 years of age.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not that girl."
I was not happy, but very difficult to question.
In the age of 18 years, with the to Vajainoprlasti.
But unhappy and feel something wrong, he of the demand for medical records.
This he learned of the horrific reality.
I said I never been Bndhsy and a the time of birth.
Bruce, who was born with the DAD, which prevented her body from making sufficient quantities of testosterone because her vagina could not be properly developed.
After, he became the man back to reality, he Nvtwa the dose of testosterone Lee and his breast.
The Shalya medical because he was childless.
Today, about Nntrseks people in the organization named Inrtrfes project explains his concept for normal people.
However, the's-based legal group the director Anne Tamar-Mattis of Adwoketls for Informed Choice expressed concern that the law of Germany "Chiprpi invite and mark."
He says, "many people think that the law of Germany Ekrtiwist inspired" Anirrdhariat "to specify the quick decision to parents and child will."
We fear that this will encourage the intervention.
We think that, man or woman instead of waiting to better specify gender process.
But we don't know how his role that law Nibhaabga, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization does so because "this is the third gender in adults familiar to the support the Australian law allows."
He said, "legal adults should be enabled in your own decisions about sex."
Related to the law it specified at the time of the birth of Germany.

George KereवAnः euro Sskoas to the dissolution option.
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we warn that the membership of the EU in the form of the condition the need for independent Scotland to join in the form of free travel area in Europe.
The stories about the extent of others on the walls of the passport control and Hbdriin on Brvik wire signal.
It is true that Strbthklaid described in the paper about the potential economic benefits of free travel with the rest of Europe, although not as Pooarrwanumanit-Hedlaalns in the description.
Nobody has explained that EU members spend most of their time in his formal rules to change their reservations.
Now that the Schengen area is not Scotland, so Bbrsels in fact instead of Scotland, which also wants to receive, it will be left in continuous non-compliance for Bbrsels cheap.
So, then, a story.
And that is trapped, he was frozen so long time. I first heard of "freedom means" think like passport control news about 40 years ago.
However, this interesting point has been lost in interesting to the old story again.
Why should independent Scotland from Europe than to the Bidiamg anyway?
Why should be buying sales, especially for the yauk Bbrsels of London now?
The real European news here: Europe organised to the great post-war planning finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Europe has been officially dead project.
Close to the opposition of the EU or euro in the form of the common currency in the EU dedicated to getting the team strength.
Even in Germany Iooroskepptil Alrtrnetiw for Germany, the party was only founded this year suddenly received almost 50 million votes in September's federal election and the Free Democrats (our own libaas Demshs, and this type of time equivalent) to effectively Bunndestbg out.
Federal was always the plan of domestic opposition to the construction of Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical Priwrtnkark.
Compliance with the Berlin and the tough rules imposed by the European Central Bank, the common currency to the national economy has been through the project because many people have to consider the obstacles that Europe went too far.
The very role of the national governments of the excessive budget deficit in the euro crisis was not only true in the case of Greece.
But the euro system has its members in favour of the German exporters currency-something that German politicians want to keep the exchange rate stable.
Without the possibility of domestic currency Avmoolyan, southern Europe gets himself in the position than the underlying loss of productivity in Germany.
That is the only way to reduce public expenditure and wage has been encouraged by Berlin.
Further points deep European productivity than on budget and currency problems.
On the expenditure of consumers by the French and German energy firms to provide free-Bbrsels was the result of the "green" energy policies, European industry in comparison with the United Nations four times for double for electricity and gas payments.
This is the cost of a loss to disabled people, which we have already seen in Gprangemawth.
All the Fzreej to be paid in the world, European Pesrokemikls cannot save the industry from being affected by cheap U.S. gas shell.
As a result, the spirit of rebellion in people, especially in France, which was once the head of the EU fans.
After Yoodrdh the top politicians to handle the EU to Germany, France and Paris was seen in the form of measures to provide the Waanshigtn equal billing in the world.
But now the need for political validity passport in the form of Paris to Berlin, and it is not Europe on the apply of their own economic policies, which undermined the economy of France.
Results: Marine Le Pen of the extreme right-wing, anti-EU National Front, recently the ruling Socialist to third place in the byelection victory.
This time the Front with 24 percent of the vote in France as it is the most popular team in due course for the British Labour warning that they can't automatically benefit Baaga for dissolution for that left, right.
Lee Payne is doing with his new found fame in French between the white, working class?
The group use the EU elections next year in the European Parliament wants to create a anti-EU, anti-intersection currency group.
If, as is quite possible, anti-EU party good display in these elections, the group of this type can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: soon the confluence of the anti-EU and anti-intersection currency in Europe will kill the euro.
The euro, will not end completely, but it will reach back in Europe "like a form of retail" (arena), which will have the support of General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of the ready Arthvyvsthaan her, can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart.
I expect that, with the UK in the hope of expanding Njdikiiaan will distance themselves from this project.
However, the growing interest in pacific Waanshigtn indicate that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
After all, what of Scotland?
We can choose to create from the area of Little England (as required).
Or we can protect their own economic interests -including Berlin and Bbrsels to tell the right time for being different.
I think that Scotland is loose in the European system can better work performance, provided that we keep its own currency.
The non-federal countries in Europe would be easy to work with other countries with common thinking here.
Otherwise we should think about maintaining our economic independence, walking on the road.
Scotland Ns.An.Pi. government-Wllekhnniy in Europe has been the most successful in parsimony anti-political campaign, which the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling carried out (and) to oppose the cuts proposed by Tory libaas des and thereafter on the basis of the coalition's majority was won in the year 2011.
This time for Scotland to vote for independence in Berlin and it will be absurd, because the position Bbrsels will be imposed by accepting the rules of parsimony.

According to the World Health Organization, only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If so, compare one physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there are doctors, however, many residents of Cameron he cannot bear the cost.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two-thirds of the health service expenditure in the private sector in the country.
Vale says, "their only problem is poverty."
And due to the poor, they could not enjoy your life.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vale took the firm resolve to resolve it some.

They are always either in hospital, or the money for your organization, so that they are trying to run these campaigns.
O'Maali like the medical and nursing students come from the United States and Europe to join the campaign in the Vale, this is experimental opportunity for them, that they can never get in their country.
O'May said, "in the surgery we are helping to tool for Dr. Vale or in the blood spots to clean, we are able to gain practical experience in them."
You never get the chance to do so in the form of the second year medical student in America.
Voluntary student Cameron from his usually have expenditure for access, and they often come with the medical, of the charity.
But after arriving Iauande took the costs of his instructions, and to go to Ana Vale.
O'May says, "there is no doubt that they are heroes."
They are giving their life for this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is to never end.
For Vale, not about the burden of work, as a difficulty.
Other people have been happy to help in life, from his father, to fulfill the promise that they are things that are very Anand provides them.
Vale says, "I'm very happy to work this time."
