Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko 
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition. 
MEPs refused in second reading the proposed amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former First Minister currently imprisoned. 
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached an agreement, a priori disadvantage with Russia for the purchase of natural gas. 
The judgment is not final, and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December. 
Tymosenko describes the political judgment of revenge of the regime and has caused suspicions of partiality of the court in the west. 
The project to cancel paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Premère Minister has been condemned, has been signed by 147 Members. 
It would have required 226 votes to approve it. 
Libyan victory 
The Libyan release or rebellion has already been defeated. 
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over. 
It remains to determine the winners. 
As it is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates or radicals. 
The Interim National Council has declared the usual Sharia law, and we know what it is. 
Libya is a country without crime because a flight is cut. 
Women can forget the emancipation, disrespectful of the faith are punishable by the death penalty... 
It is the Koran that will unite the personality of the dictator society composed of opposing tribes. 
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent and as we would certainly not. 
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyan. 
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted the recognition of dogs infidels. 
The only excuse is that this is not an American general who led the NATO bombing but Allah that they celebrated the greatness in each attack. 
When it comes to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not 
We have participated in the shooting, used Islam and our poilitiques were diverted from the dictator as a political ally without brings no benefit. 
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily Libya. 
There is therefore no problem for the local to get rid of "crusaders." 
Is that without soil, oil companies will have easy access to libyien black gold. 
Perhaps not as much, and the West can finally boast of a desintéressée protection of human rights. 
To prevent these followers of Sharia. 
A new era of crisis begins. 
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.

The Czech economy has had a growth rate of 1.5% in the third quarter.

The Czechs have qualified for the euro. 
They have won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million 
The representation of football has been the most difficult task of the season! 
In Montenegro, she has won also thanks to the super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0. 
The Czech football has dearly defended with a lot of luck in the second part of his qualification and will not miss the European championship. 
IHNED CS followed the qualification game with a detailed report. 
No particular excitement during the first part and a large part of the second chance. 
The Czech representation has won also thanks to the super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the European championship. 
The monténégrains found themselves under pressure in the second part because of a specific Czech defence. 
The vicitmes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic missed two chances to score a goal. 
And thanks to the super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and a reward of 200 million kronor in the fund of the Czech football. 
In the first minutes we played a warrior football. 
The two teams could hardly get combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line. 
The pressure of national footballers has not arrived to break the Czech defence which has responded specifically to long shots even during the first time. 
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their country. 
They have created a human shield 
A few hundred students from graduate schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran. 
They want to support the nuclear program of their country by this gesture in response to a possible Israeli attack. 
Students have begun to pray at noon at the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel. 
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield around the nuclear technology center in Esfahan is processed uranium. 
They have openly stated that they would defend the nuclaire of their country at the risk of their own lives. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons. 
Reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. 
Students have begun to pray at noon at the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel. 
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site is enriched uranium. 
The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and takes the deli for lunch 
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years were overweight, 9% of écoliersont weight above average and 5% are obese. 
As shown by the current research obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle. 
This shows once again how important is the environment in which humans and models that surround it. 
On the tables of obese children is an example of the deli 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight. 
19% of obese had dinner fries, according to the survey conducted with an awareness "obesity is not an accident." 
In the families of small big sport is not also a habit, which is now the case of most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement. 
Investigation of 900 children 
The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 students of primary schools in Czech Republic. 
It was the second edition of "the Obesity is no coincidence," supported by the General Insurance and Unilever. 
 Since the beginning is more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who have enrolled in the project. 
One of the key factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or obese, is the lack of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise. 
"Only half the children interviewed said for example eat five times a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition," said one of the results of the investigation. 
Without breakfast and dinner Deli 
Experts draw attention to the fact that a healthy development requires a few basic details such as a breakfast at the same time. 
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time. 
In the majority of families each takes his breakfast alone. 
And the worst that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not breakfast. 
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet. 
The survey showed that in families of obese children often consume unhealthy fries. 
Almost every pupil - not to mention the weight - drink every day drinks sweet (70%). 
More than 40% of children interviewed sport regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%. 
Prepares you your diet 
Another part of the investigation has allowed selected children (204 boys and girls of 13 schools) to prepare their own food options according to their own taste and their personal opinion. 
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years away, a healthy diet, the ideal." 
Among their favourite dishes, there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets. 
"The most alarming is a large preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the results of the investigation. 
For lunch the pasta that took the first place just before the white meat. 
Children are not at all wanted starch and preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low. 
Focus on health 
The investigation has shown that children are ready to change their habits when they receive the relevant information. 
"During a review of a group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the outreach session" obesity is not an accident ," it was assité with a definite willingness to move towards a healthy diet," indicate the results of the investigation. 
The most marked example in relation to sweet lemonades because children have begun to give preference to water consumption. 
Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and cut the sweet dishes and "knedliky" (spécialté Czech dumplings meal of bread or potatoes). 
The designer should also be a good psychologist, say professionals. 
In an article on how to learn for the designers, I am a little bit angry by the fact that there were many from the start. 
I do not think what would happen. 
Presentations of three professional specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground. 
And it will be worse. 
The more we are approaching the final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information. 
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays is truly "packed." 
This time we have with the Director Alenka (there is no boy) treaty on how to dress a woman who has no standard measurements. 
And women of this type is the majority. 
One has a small neck, a body of boy, without any particular curve, another overweight. 
The designer must know how it ammenuiser wide arm, extend a neck or add necessary curves. 
We arrived to highlight nicely the character and also not dress too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a fine size. 
If there is a difference between the size and hips in such a way that skirts or trousers are not, it is worth. 
And you do not regret it because the clothing that falls neatly is invaluable. 
In a skirt you'll feel much better than in the shifting wraps over and does not take the belt and so forth. 
For those who have a male appearance can afford a dress style Tucker, with pieces of woven fabrics, or embroidery. 
There is obviously a lot of examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to collect all the information received. 
But I also fear that what I should do home there too. 
Each student received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening. 
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality as well as his appearance. 
I will have to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know the Victoria's Secret of the campaign. 
At the bottom of me, it gives me pleasure, because it is better than dressed Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has taken almost 100 kilograms lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez. 
We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the Internet, print and graphics. 
The Moodboard, as we say in the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic creation. 
Also reflect on the graphical portion of the styling is also important. 
The designer clothes not only physical but creates productive pages in magazines (on product trends for handbags, jackets, etc.). 
Mario Kamenik, stylist and designer, we had all this. 
But this,... until Sunday 
The designer must have a general vision 
Three of the specialty guests gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters. 
Pokorny Honza, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer. 
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know. 
And a talented designer knows how to work with a single dress differently. 
The variability is for this important example. 
Such as the trench coats that must be worn with jeans and a T-shirt like a light coat, but it can also dress the naked body, with escarpins and photo as a dress. 
Or it is enough to lift the sleeves and the collar and immediately have a new look. 
"Playing with it," he said. 
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules." 
"You can then begin to break," said Jakub. 
Finally I understand why it is trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, whereas in fashion magazines is sometimes something else. 
No statement on fashion. 
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have a lot more variants of clothing than those who are photographed. 
In other words, for Fashion story which will have a dozen pages (a dozen models) I must be ready to "retailler" at least a fortnight. 
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality. 
We must reckon with it during the creation of a model. 
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success has been confirmed by Pokorny Honza. 
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer, but his image and marketing has been a global star. 
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains cautious. 
And the familiar faces sometimes considered useless (it is enough that I know something, but what I look at the second). 
And if someone is doing a styling on our part, we must then rely on the fact that it teaches us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than it has in reality. 
We still have to navigate google and ensure that the news of Boulevard fame, if she has never smoked or grown etc... 
Honza and Mario asked Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to move in the fashion and assemble models. 
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is important to be a good psychologist. 
Guess the people, not to pander, retain his opinion. 
"When a manager would ask you to sort out his cupboard and fill new elements you can't just throw and say, My God! Horror." 
"You will find a few cases that you find beautiful and that you will be discussing with them," said Mario. 
It showed us practically everything must contain the so-called "placovka" or designer bag. 
This is the one you fasten around the size and you yourself for everything you need. 
Besides things clearly defined as scissors, dépilation rolls or even pins nurturer, includes nylon yarn (the designer used to photograph products such as bags, hats), special clips with which closes a garment in the back, if it is too big (or other kind of bar are not utlisables because they might disturb the clothing) or a sewing kit. 
So that we can not only people who are listening, but who have tried something practical way they taught us how to properly ressemeller shoes. 
And during the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the soles could be damaged, particularly in lextérieur. 
And so we stuck and stuck. 
We did not have the right to touch the scissors to not get hurt inadvertently. 
It means real skills. 
Mario gave me pleasure when I congratulated him for my creation. 
The competence of which I am is not for my girlfriend. 
This is only a small summary of what we have learned during the second weekend 
I am increasingly beginning to understand that styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants. 
The need for speed The Run competes across America. 
Review 
Originally a race without problem is because of a series of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine early morning shift at work. 
It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each, but it is pointless if nobody wants to do something more. 
The new party subtitled The Run has produced great expectations before his exit. 
He promised to take a new direction with a series of race Need for Speed and out a kind of game from the jouables parties that would not only with points. 
We were therefore curious how will be added to the passages in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants. 
As is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than atttendait. 
These are potentially racing games arcades, but the whole shoot down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years. 
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of developers. 
The adventure begins very well. 
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has characters and to resolve to participate in illegal races across America. 
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first in New York. 
The idea has some interesting elements. 
The route is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races. 
The result is that each race is on a different route and stages in different environments that differ quite well and are interesting. 
The player did not feel one moment that the game is proposing something similar. 
Some environments are quite nice, even if the technical level graphic is of the same type as the previous series. 
Finally, this is not the end of the world. 
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant. 
The tests are an atypical element. 
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sand storm that you diminish significantly visibility. 
Then in the mountains you must be careful to ensure that an avalanche you do not fall over. 
The different races are structured behind the other. 
There was only a small number, but it is enough. 
There are moments you surpass the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you will be running against the clock (classic duel with the clock) and then you yet another duel with an opponent. 
From time to time you have the police who enters the game and who is trying to make the situation difficult. 
The novelty is the crossings outside the vehicle. 
It is rather una interactive animation when most of the time Jack escaped before someone and you have to help by banging on the right button at the right time. 
Nothing complicated. 
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than what you expect (to be practical there are only three). 
The result is that because this is not likely to hinder and, in the context described above, in the elements that enhances the game. 
The model is in the tradition of previous games. 
This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary, but we cannot say that this is negative. 
With regard to the realistic simulation you have to look elsewhere. 
But although you can find better in the conccurrence the pattern of conduct goes very well with the type of design of the races. 
So everything is OK. 
The problems begin to appear after some time. 
The diffférence model is not yet at the point. 
We do not expect this game complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how is your car, this is not completely right. 
During the tight exceedances sometimes you touch each other slightly but otherwise your car in mad acrobatics. 
Or crumbs. 
Thanks to the system of recovery that is not really a problem, but it really upsets. 
The recovery is so that when you have broken or you are left in the stage the game takes you back at the time of the last point on the route. 
But you have only five redémarrages. 
When you used the 5 redémarrages you have to start the game from the start. 
It is a tool, if something is not happening as it is, that old adage on which you can really count. 
Sometimes the redémarrages do not help, and we need to find a solution in remémorrant memory piece of route. 
The big problem of this game is that the same actions are in the same places. 
For example, there are subtle shifts that we need to move from a certain way otherwise it does not. 
Otherwise you have on a given place "civilian" vehicles still in the same configuration as you first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late. 
Angry situations when you see easily move your opponent between two cars oncoming and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and conturner or halt. 
If you go out to him because it is "calculated" in such a way that the situation is still very close to your nose. 
Opponents still have other advantages. 
During the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same adversary that precedes the same place. 
This irritates the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction. 
The opponent must go before you. 
When he goes before you hide the sight of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you get a good number of times. 
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly. 
And it is a pity, because through a simple model of the game is interesting and places with so much that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens. 
And that is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of being bored or something else. 
The original idea is the change of car racing. 
You must be careful with gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars, though most of the time you enough. 
Cars are divided into three categories. 
Sports cars are ideal for cities, gas-guzzlers for straight highways and super sports cars in exotic garb on the highly technical lines on the winding roads in the mountains. 
And the challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime in history. 
You get not only medals but also experience that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and adventure. 
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects are starting to be unlocked: 
It goes online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and you have other functions in the community. 
One of the most difficult shots to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure. 
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (sounds like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it is). 
Your speedometer is between 150 and 200 kilometers per hour (a priori) and behind you is a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal. 
In the preparation we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone has really looked at the creation of this game or whether the authors we really take for fools. 
The technical part of the game is not dead, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super. 
What is annoying is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases tragically. 
This is especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is nothing. 
The noise is good and the runway is the choice. 
In order to please the greatest number and particularly to the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I blend," but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music. 
General impression of Need for Speed: the Run is really confused. 
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years. 
But this game gives the impression of not being finished. 
The amusement is really well but prepare you for the mistakes you pat in the eye with the force of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador EU: 
The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and Eurosceptics 
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions." 
"I do not expect a harsh war." 
"It will be 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players get used to their new role," as Vicenova Miléna began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador near the European Union. 
When she was able to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University might envy, she has shown how it takes its motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously. 
Ms. Vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council. 
"From the outset echoed the criticism that it is bland, that it is a rond-de-cuir, that he cannot rempplir any mission and I have to say that he has cut the breath to everyone because he holds his role to perfection." 
"It is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe." 
She explained the new post of High Representative for foreign affairs and defence policy within the framework of an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union?" to which telephone number should I call? ," so as an important step towards unity and greater transparency of the policy of the EU states, such as China or India. 
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked very strong) 
Ms. Vicenova also lived, live and will live in a time near the European Council. 
She called the Czech presidency two years of success. 
The Czech have resolved the crisis, the gas crisis or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership. 
She described the collapse of the government very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic. 
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy. 
In the words of Ambassador, "beat" not only for the presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now. 
We must approve the new septimal budget of the Union, which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation. 
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and economies, what branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the least, everything has to be resolved within the framework of future negotiations. 
Ambassador recalled its slogans with which it arrived in Brussels "for a Europe understandable." 
"I definitely don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands. 
As must understand the citizen that it is true that in Brussels nobody gherkins rings or twisted, differemment large bananas or that nobody has banned syrecky." 
It wants to better use the environment of the EU and see more Czechs in the European institutions. 
A multi-speed Europe ahead 
According to the ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who do not see things in their negative aspect more than positively. 
It is sorry to see a small Czech representation in European institutions. 
The fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side. 
In addition to a Czech presidency success then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group. 
"Believe me, when they come to me the Poles, the Magyar, Slovak, French told me: ' Hey, what do you do there, what is still the Visegrad?" and it is not at all happy. " 
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future there are new tough rules on fiscal policy facing the member countries. 
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation." 
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone." 
"We have the Schengen area, we have also the institute for enhanced cooperation." 
First it was said that cooperation among the countries who want and those who do not wish to remain in their corner." 
"There will be a lot of institutes of this kind and there will be a Europe really at two speeds," expects Mrs. Vicenova. 
From this point of view it has also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be debated between all members of the EU and not just the memebres of the eurozone. 
Story of a mark: 
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence 
If someone had to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term." 
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm considered very current and yet since its inception it has passed 100 years. 
The basis of this long-term strategy has been thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. 
He has left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider. 
Its slogan "PENSE'!" has become the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935). 
It was the basis of the culture of the company soignement developed by Watson. 
IBM means a long-term thinking of continuing movements directed towards the future. 
IBM has survived 100 years thanks to the fact that it still remained true to its core values and has not been afraid to change all the others around it. 
This allowed us during our first century to transform the technology, business and society. 
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more " délaré for the anniversary of the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano. 
A well-prepared system 
Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with its employees as Bata Czech Republic - people from IBM were the only one of the first American to have paid vacations, employer-paid more uniform elegant employee and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and commmerciaux. 
IBM has a system of relationships with the client well developed. 
The company was initially inspired by the discovery of talent - as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice. 
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. 
IBM has been working for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy. 
IBM in recent years is the so-called jamy, brain - online discussion from many future strategies and innovations. 
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500,000 people who work. 
An institution with a good name 
It is the internal and external image of the company to ensure a secure position in the business areas. 
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the School of Economics at Harvard and author of the book on IBM. 
"IBM is not a technlogique firm, but a firm that helps to solve problems in the world of business by using its technology," added Geogre Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research. 
As the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create this market. 
IBM - or the "Big Blue," as it is called colloquially in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms. 
This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services at the level of server products to nanotechnology. 
It has many patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize. 
Among his discoveries such as the distributor of banknotes, the payment card, the financial swap, the code bar or the disk. 
IBM rose this year with $220 billion in the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time in 1996 it was Microsoft. 
Overview in advance 
These are not all the innovations and fabrications that have had customer preference and then - IBM for example failed bet on an operational system OS/2, Prodige service online or IBM PCjr: 
"From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you can't émotionellement remain hooked on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano. 
IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work. 
Unlike Microsoft conccurent, which is and remains under the Windows operating system. 
A technology perspective 
In the IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place. 
Yet in 1990 it was with the motié of the highest representative of hardware. 
From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets for 15 billion dollars, during cettre period it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of technology prospects. 
It continues investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis. 
IBM is negotiating with the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment. 
It is now that IBM is the current crisis without being worried? 
The price of IBM progessé from 2008 to 120%, the net profit of the firm continues to grow. 
The logo of the firm IBM is to change everything, but not its values. 
We can expect that this giant flexible control of other crises. 
IBM's history: from slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos. 
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a century ago; it was originally the complicated name of Tabulating Computing Corporation. 
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America. 
The basis of the future IBM has been the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80 year nineteenth. 
They had technologies such as the old "pointeuses," which recorded the arrival and departure of employees. 
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Council of Surveillance of society. 
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company. 
The leader then presented the shadows to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that are so far the identity and culture of society. 
Watson led the firm kusqu' in 1952. 
IBM, as its name, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - seed cutters of cheese and meat until the cash registers. 
During the first four years in which Watson led, the turnover was multiplied up to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world. 
Watson was the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership is his son who served as the director, Thomas J Watson. 
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. 
In the 1960s people and computers of IBM helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the moon. 
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360. 
The classic PC that determined the standard computer with the IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981. 
Twenty years later IBM sells its computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with a high added value. 
The strategy that succeeds in IBM over the past three years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a smarter planet." 
Its goal is the uilisation smart technology in untapped areas such as transportation and management of cities. 
In terms of trade IBM has developed a platform "Smarter Trade" that helps business manage the business cycle. 
IBM has a strong history on our territory. 
It set up its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Today, in addition to IBM, there is also the strategic centre since Brno. 
The Central for the Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague, and there is also the team of research and development of the global recognition of the floor. 
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband. 
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more! 
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it is over! 
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) becomes bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up her pink dream and return to the house. 
It has not been able to wait and set clear rules for the future life. 
"Pepa can go back to the house, but not as my partner," explained Rychtarova. 
When Rychtarova Darina gave asylum to Bartosova in her house, she had not realised that the couple would not. 
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move Ricany, Pepa not dismissed the singer. 
And he admitted in public that he loved. 
With the time Darina has resigned, has accepted the link of her husband and has come to say goodbye forever. 
Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer. 
If Rychtar and Bartosova there will be no wife to greet him on the door of the house. 
"It is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will be outside." 
"It will no longer be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," has leaked Rychtarova by showing that she was detached from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship. 
The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph. 
"I respect the decision of my wife." 
"I will stay with Iveta and do not change." 
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect it." 
"The company continues, I deal with the repairs, the garden, real estate, I buy." 
"With Darina are completely normal, but we do not set down together," said Rychtar Blesk. 
If Rychtarova finds a new love will not prevent it. 
"We do not set down together, and it does not want to know where it goes, with whom and whether it has a link. 
I know that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take my responsibility," said Joseph. 
The worst vices of women: you? 
If you ask the men to determine typical vices of women, all, like the others, are able to get out of their game." 
My dear lady, you will know in the following lines of female vices arriving to pump blood from the veins of men. 
Purchases 
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases? 
Should you buy at least one garment per week? 
You are happy to buy and packages at the time of the balances? 
In your case you can talk about shopping as a vice. 
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion to make purchases. 
But you say, which could stand at the window shop for clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)? 
And although most women buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell. 
Remind you just how many times have you told your spouse that he expected... 
Constant dissatisfaction 
"I am not too big?" 
"I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start to make sport?" 
"I like?" 
These phrases do not tell you something? 
Yes? 
Therefore, you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance. 
This is not the question that you should stop dealing with yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance. 
Sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints is growing and more women become empoisonnantes. 
FEBEA's and cleanliness in the first place 
It is like an endless circus. 
Wash the windows, vacuuming, cleaning up the soil, dust, strip the bathroom - and twice a week. 
You make remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, children that they have sullied the sink, encrassé window in the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work? 
If you have precisely this obsession, try to have in mind that we should not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness must not be the first place in the family. 
This harmless desire for cleanliness can spoil your relationship and family peace. 
The work of undermining 
"This spent tracksuit to the dustbin." 
"You put these old socks again tomorrow?" 
"A wet towel has nothing to do with earth." 
If you are on your partner undermines this several times a day, you will really break down. 
It is obvious that you do not think bad you want everything to be perfect. 
Perhaps if the men knew, women would not be undermined... 
Defamation, the persiflage 
Defamation, the persiflage but also insults against someone of some women. 
Women are particularly relations and thus are happy to address topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why. 
Perhaps each of us escape a small harmless persiflage here and there. 
The heart it is a peculiarity of women. 
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise others and for them - especially at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous. 
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia 
The attacker hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory of Philadelphia during Monday's NHL game on the ice of Caroline and is once again leading Czech productive players for the competition. 
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has yet made a pass and was named the best player of the game, he has scored in both cases. 
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr also scored two goals during the match. 
Jagr after the match told reporters Mr. Zavadzki that he had warned Giroux's that it would be a great evening. 
"I told him before the match that he would give his has provided trick." 
"I have felt." 
"Sometimes this sense you fall on it," said Jagr after Giroux was a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers. 
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team. 
Voracek fought behind the goals at Hurricanes and striker Maxime Talbot. 
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers. 
In Giroux. 
In cooperation with Jagr had three goals, then Wayne Simmonds made a fourth goal. 
"I love playing with him." 
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but it really is one of the three best," said Jagr about its centre. 
"I had never thought that I jouerais at the end of his career with a hokeyjiste like him." 
"I am really happy with it." 
"I want to play on him." 
"All these years in the NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," said Jagr. 
Caroline did a drama of this game with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer on a penalty shot ends with a difference of one goal. 
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended two to one. 
"Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area." 
"He got at, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote corner of the cage. 
"I tried to hit and I was there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view. 
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference. 
The Czech defender Montreal's Jaroslav Spacek has not finished the game with Buffalo he walked in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body. 
The Candiens did not take an experienced defender ahead of two butset lost after a penalty kick shot by 2:3. 
Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks. 
It is the fact that the rear line was ill especially debt the local coach rather than points lost because they played the game only with five defenders. 
"It is zero." 
"We have played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people." 
"But there is nothing to do, it is like that," said Jacques Martin. 
"Replacing it was not enough and we were not able to resist." 
"We had just to simplify the game, moving at outside of our area." 
For this we had limits," said one of the defenders P. K. Subban. 
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the 30th attack in Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay. 
Five different shooters have been uax goals for the Jets, who have arrested a series of five matches lost. 
How have changed the price of travel since 1989 
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only five travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. 
Travel agencies at the time of travel, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the West were very limited. 
The Czech tourists were travelling for the holiday in Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). 
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a penchant for the West and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists. 
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it nétait not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechs) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries. 
In cases where the Tchécoslovaque citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland and the Soviet Union had a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed. 
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West must also be queuing all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency. 
And even after that it was not yet won. 
The agreement for the currency was the condition for travel to the West was denied the "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all. 
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, shared and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the consent of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west. 
The Czechs were the more frequently their holidays in the country where there were so many campaign houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and usually lasts until now. 
The journeys of the Czechs have since seen since 1989 a major revolution. 
Although until 1989 holidays in Germany and Bulgaria were at most, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world. 
The great paradox that we did not realise today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to move freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time. 
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of visits short mainly in Austria in Vienna and Germany. 
The Czechs could not long fly to the West that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. 
For example, in Paris the travel organisations were sleeping the Czechs in tents in parks because our income could not pay the hotel or a pension. 
The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was at this time to take away its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save. 
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that has enabled our tourists finally after dozens of years to be able to freely buy the Western currency. 
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased what has caused around the year 1997 another important moment. 
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with charter air links through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what there was before. 
In the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most developed countries around the world who later facilitated our trips. 
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism after the revolution, when prepared the first charter flight to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic. 
Since this year as every year Air Carriers' direct visit Czech tourists in distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. 
It is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year! 
An interesting moment in this period that symbolises our revolution happened in 2008. 
On 17 November 2008 the EU have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to move completely in the group of developed countries. 
In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history have spent more than 15,000 kronor per person for holidays abroad including incidentals kronor per person. 
The General Assembly must find its President, but this is likely to be completed by an unresolved situation "by" 
5mois already Czech football is without President and the risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly scheduled Thursday at Nymburk. 
However, there is still no agreement on how to vote. 
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates. 
Rajchl Jindrich, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football. 
Hasek resigned in June and his departure has called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future. 
Only during the era after Hasek football is back to differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a common candidate. 
This has fully demonstrated on 16 September when he had to choose a new president. 
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiations are blocked and it has not even been discussed to address how to elect. 
There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives, or officials with full powers. 
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since this moment with the assistance of the Office for the state and the law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible. 
The differences still persist about the rules for the election. 
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its extraordinary or planned negotiations, has brought nothing to the situation 
Views on the voting possibilit? have changed several times, but the key point remains the same. 
The question is: how to proceed in the third round in order not to fall into the by. 
"The bone of contention is the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," noted one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football within the association. 
According to the rules of the model predicted gains in the third round of the candidates who have received the most votes in proportion to the chamber for which he is a candidate. 
Moravia is ready to withdraw so that wins the candidate who receives the largest percentage of votes of the two chambers. 
The Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes. 
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds, and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian party and who would be better not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force. 
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agree, even if he believes that the settlement of elections established under the statute Pelta advantage among all candidates. 
"I hope that we vote at the maximum, according to the statutes of the association." 
"So that there is not yet insane ideas dreamt up by a representative during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen candidate for the first time and in its submissions was defined primarily against Pelta. 
Pelta remains optimistic. 
He said Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively. 
"The qualification possible today in European Championships should calm everybody." 
"Football will again on a wave of happiness and there is one more way for cooperation," added the Jablonec officer who among the three was the greatest experience in professional football at the regional level. 
Rajchl is more pessimistic. 
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense." 
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are trends to change the regulations to design." 
"This can cause a blockage in the General Assembly." 
"I hope that good reason will win," said Rajchl. 
There is not much time for a common agreement to all parties. 
Some réuunions should be held directly in Montenegro, but who can say whether the direction of football will be complete for the game. 
The special charter flight which had to travel up to Podgorice including the Vice-Presidents Kucera and Rajchl Dalibor, did not take off for technical reasons and sought a variant to take part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation. 
At the end is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive. 
The Minister of Education for Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties within the sports association the highest in the country and bring them to an agreement. 
In the game there are many: a state allocation, the credibility of football and the General Assembly of the Czech Union Sports, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. 
Paclik will fight for the post of president because he sees no good candidate. 
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly, whose profile would have responded to everything that it calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be campaigning for this high office. 
"If such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I am not present at the election." 
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik in the Czech press Agency (TKC). 
The motivation for Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Rajchl Jindrich to just try to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT that initially would be given a favorite for this election. 
Paclik stressed that if he won the next election would be held only until 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly. 
He would see an experienced manager and a high level, but who is not connected with the world of football. 
"I talked with people who would have the profile," he said. 
"For me it was terrible when some people told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment." 
"I would like to change this image," he added. 
What, they say, especially annoying Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and President of the Union regional football Plzen Roman Berbr, the controversial reputation, which is known in the wings as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of the delegates " the General Assembly. 
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President. 
"If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football." 
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-powered trader, it would be even less favourable to football," declared Paclik. 
What offends still is the fact that the name of Pelta has been pronounced it a few years during wiretaps in the context of an investigation into a case of corruption, for which Pelta has emerged without any penalty. 
"I don't know what Pelta prestige would bring football." 
"And how would we be viewed in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the club of Plzen." 
If Paclik would win the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta. 
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing. 
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go." 
"It has great capability" 
"It would be able to present himself as head of the representation." 
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able." 
"I am not the nose in what I do not know," said Paclik, who in September has attracted much attention when he called for the annulment of the Commission of referees with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova. 
Paclik says that he would be at the level to lead the Association. 
It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that it also runs since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support in May his triumph in the first division. 
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and culture." 
"I freinerais the influence of some interested groups that tend to affect the Disciplinary Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," said Paclik chache not his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. 
It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power of lobbies would get for sport more money from the tax on games. 
"It is one of the key points that the new President should address." 
"If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where will the money," he said. 
Paclik does not take its current connection with the club of Plzen as something negative, even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties." 
Pelta is linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague. 
"This is not ideal." 
I see no reason to convey my actions of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to come back after a year and a half," said Paclik. 
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT, which should put an end to situations by. 
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future to squabbles over the rules for the elections. 
The Jablonec official is before the meeting on Thursday at Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the success today of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote. 
Pelta before the election of September has not carried out correctly has promised to devote themselves to national representation and obtaining money if he is elected. 
He is determined to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly has passed and the delay of two months could allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present in a broad context. 
"People at all levels of football for a long time and wait until Thursday there is a President." 
"They feel that this is the best time for somebody to the leadership of the Association," he said, but it is primarily associated with the club of Jablonec, has worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. 
It is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. 
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in lépoque of Ivan Hasek. 
"Unfortunately" assembled in June have undergone that were not perfect as everyone realized. " 
"If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a president since September," said Pelta. 
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of delegates. 
"If I become president, I take as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in cases where it does not work." 
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," added Pelta. 
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents. 
He said previously that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes his training in law and that he knows full well that his opponent - candidate would be his first Vice-President. 
He has not attacked long Tonas Paclik who instead does not stop criticizing Pelta. 
"It evolves in football for a year and has already had some success." 
"His attacks were not the most honourable and surprised many people in the course of the campaign." 
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said Pelta at the address of his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations that he made in September. 
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football competitions at the lowest level up to the national réprésentation. 
This should be a football vitirne. 
"And I also endeavour to complete all the cases that begin with Bohémians or the result of the scandal of corruption." 
"I entrerais immediately in negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the Czech news agency CTK reported the fifty-sixth candidate two months ago. 
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not change. 
"I should be acquainted with all employees," he said in Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction. 
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing. 
"If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will be able to overcome." 
"Football needs credibility and it will only be when there will be at its head a new leader," as stated optimistically Pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his career. 
Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard 
"If the current Vice-President Rajchl Jindrich is elected new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday that course would not please many people, it seems. 
Rajchl promises, however, that if it is elected we will begin to work hard. 
He wants systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the different areas of football. 
He has promised to settle the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to make football more money and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek. 
"As president I want to play football in its entirety." 
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful football for youth." 
"But I am not saying that I will do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for TKC. 
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members of a particular area." 
"And I will hand out difficult missions for the football against a big step forward." 
"A lot of people are not happy because it will begin to work hard rather than criticising others," he added. 
He said that he would not run as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere. 
"To me, we know that I am working 20 hours a day." 
"But I need to know if this is true and if I have people behind me who will constantly sticks in the wheels and emit doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated. 
"A lot of people have said that I do not have to give up because they also refuse." 
"A confidence that I cannot betray," he said. 
What motivates them, they say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek. 
"Since these last two years there has been a lot of work done and I don't want to let them down." 
"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone stops." he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek. 
"I believe in a systematic work and this is something that Mirek Pelta does not know." 
"Behind him are people who fairaient football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been chosen." 
"You can say a number of things, but certainly not to support someone." 
"I am trying to be objective." 
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen 
And it confirms once again that it would be only a President for the Czech Republic. 
"And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do the maximum for Moravia." 
"For example, it is the time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian whose victors would first division." 
"There would be no situation like now with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is now to find young players. 
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning. 
"I sense an ongoing support of the Czech Chamber has elected its Vice President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl, who is considering its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating contracts with television and on the law on the games. 
He said instead that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault at all. 
While he said about Pelta "that he was disqualified because the Czech footblal would lose its credibility," he believes that the second Paclik opponent is a strong candidate who has to offer football. 
"No one can doubt Plzen that he has done this year a superb job." 
"If he was elected, he would surely in what has been started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions." 
"It would not spoil its success," said Rajchl, who has assessed his rivals. 
Europe's finest swimming pools 
A leap in the blue 
Julia Stanek 
Wading pools of UFO, beautiful swimming pools in Budapest: who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and turned the city or a long walk - can leave her tired legs in soft-drink baths. 
A book shows in which swimming pool can experience the most well-being. 
When Iris Meder went into research trip during the last 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his baggage: his swimsuit. 
Lying on his back in the water, she retorted cupolas artistically arranged, and swimming against the marbles Putten expected from the other side of the pool and failed to admire Art Nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools. 
If a covered swimming pool was fun, she noted in her book without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building. 
More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and presented in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies Bain." municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palace bloodbath in the woods, "concrete buildings Hardcore" in the Taunus. 
She has led her "trips to the most outstanding baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. 
The German 46 years is a true devotee of the culture of the bath. 
Meder, explains that it is not a great deal of interest in sport but Yukon feels attracted to water in a completely different way. 
It is irritating that swimming fans should simply look blue tiles and cope with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe perfume relatively stable populations of spruce forests or can listen to the joyous trill of birds in the park. 
"I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly," said the Viennese. 
"I started a collection of beautiful baths." 
The surface of the water doubly reinforces the architecture 
A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of wellbeing in the swimming rooms are enormous because all the senses are awake, according to Meder. 
And if the builders would be given a little more room to swim could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor surface water in the swimming rooms." 
"It is transparent, but reflects the beauty of the whole building." 
All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards. 
The volume of image of small "Badefreuden" is a report worth 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historic welfare - he certainly want to make a leap into the blue. 
The Meder collector has discovered remarkable copies during his research in Hungary. 
Alongside welfare splendid baths as the Szechenyi bath aged 100 years ago in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing in a natural cave in the Karst cave in Miskolc - Tapolca) as well as a bath baths whose basins are filled with water containing alcali (and Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building in the form of a bottle. 
By contrast, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a bath house in Zurich was the entire city in his eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St Anton: the Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which we can observe animation on the ski hill. 
Perhaps the most extraordinary design of swimming pool awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: the Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles a UFO that has just landed on the Alps. 
In winter, steam rises from the three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal into the sky. 
Algesiras in the Black Forest 
The smell of bleach does not come from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection. 
Many thermal baths are a smell of sulphur, Árpád spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong smell of oil, that it is hard to believe, to find themselves in a health spa. 
The smell is coming from the alkaline waters containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black and silt you stuck to the skin as soon as you let slip into the pool - a special spa experience. 
During his quest of the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder has also suffered disappointments: when she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricaded area. 
The bath designed by the Du?an architèque Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed. 
A glance through the window of the building - Art Nouveau in red, white and yellow, she has observed the development of weeds between the tiles. 
She has observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Baths of Bad Wildbad. 
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only elements New Roman leaving since its conception in 1844 but still a Moorish Alhambra style room was added in 1900. 
Since its careful modernization of 1995, the palace spa remains the favorite bath pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because she is a native of Schwarzwald. 
"It is already a beautiful performance that if different styles of building a formidable unit," said Meder. 
With such a palace, diving in the pool is apparently only a minor issue. 
Agricultural speculation 
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials 
Christian Teevs 
The German bank abandons its speculation on raw materials? 
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor. 
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw the consequences. 
Hamburg 
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that the banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat. 
Two thirds of respondents demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world. 
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch. 
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October. 
The author Harald Schumann highlighted in this article that speculation on raw materials, pushing prices upwards and that the banks share a complicity in the global famine. 
The campaign to protect consumers aligns specifically against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way. 
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. 
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the view that the gamblers have posted offers and demand - and benefit very poor. 
Ackermann responded to the criticism of American competitors differently: he promised to investigate the accusations and said, "nothing is worth jeopardizing the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank." 
According to Spiegel Online, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch. 
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented with a recommendation, usually. 
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences. 
It could be a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment. 
Ackermann built its Image 
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows a particularly drastic, how banks today are detrimental to the general interest." 
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation. 
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all of its portfolio investments, for which money has been spent on food speculation," said Bode. 
"It is important for Mr. Ackermann, if it is a question of starving people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake." 
The awareness of Ackermann at first glance may seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group would like to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office. 
Deutsche Bank did announce on Monday that the President of the Council of Administration will not change what is planned within the Council of Administration. 
It could improve its brand with an abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation. 
And about possible losses, it has little to worry about - his successor will be. 
One in two would terminate investments on raw materials. 
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the manager. 
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization. 
Bode released the survey Tuesday, with which 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute has conducted surveys among 1,001 people. 
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made. 
Many of the bank's customers would also personal consequences if they were told that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on raw materials. 
43% déconseilleraient of such a bank in their entourage, 49% said they think about the termination of their account to change banking institution. 
21st house in Vienna 
The Pavilion, which moved 
Ingeborg Wiensowski 
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin. 
Now it is once again open and exhibition house. 
If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, for his clear forms, its glass hangars, its bright and bold and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for Expo in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example. 
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once the "great Architecture Prize" for its construction steel and glass, light and suspended. 
Construction is seen until today as a milestone in contemporary architecture. 
He has made so famous architects, that he has also built the Pavilion for Expo. 
With his legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at the international level in 1973. 
His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the World Exposition in the Garden at the railway station in the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened 
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to display the works of art, not a good environment. 
However, it has been so long that contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna. 
Since 2001 the building was empty and has become increasingly dilapidated. 
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "home of the 21st century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art. 
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, in which the house is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view. 
The new start was carried out by Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. 
Husslein - Arco, has promoted an art historian at a considerable career in his youth skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, she has led to particularly well the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, it has received public funds and private sponsorship and exploitation. 
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation is the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookshop, and an office should be built. 
Strict supervision, small budget 
Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter. 
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht, and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the flag was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibitions. 
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and his change of use. 
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "an abyss," says Krischanitz. 
The profiles of windows of glass facades were changed, glass insulation reinforced fibreglass was raised and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass. 
The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated. 
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of subdued light between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the slight Schwanzer Pavilion. 
The outer doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a colour protection against rust red-brown color. 
And the movie theatre is even identical to what it once was. 
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget. 
"Often materials that are good and cheap were to be found, and which also appealed to the Office of the monuments," said Krischanitz, and it draws attention to a crude soil underground. 
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light. 
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which originated in Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City." 
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and is still "awaken the conscience." 
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the "area of Central Station" newly planned, with offices and apartments. 
And another stroke of luck might happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the addition of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berlin's temporary art centre, and as it is said, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden. 
Bahn is planning a winter package crisis. 
The company of the railways has developed a plan - crisis, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter. 
The number of employees is expected to double. 
It costs millions. 
In the fight against the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year. 
The daily Bild Zeitung reported earlier, citing an internal crisis in the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be provided until 2015. 
This should allow greater availability of vehicles and the rail network in the event of extreme weather conditions. 
The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of rail facilities and docks is expected to double between 16,000 people. 
The aim is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90% of the equipment needed to service within a period of four to five hours. 
There are two months ago the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents this winter. 
Last winter the railways had a lot of problems for transport users, because it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions. 
So many new regional trains have been waiting for permission from the Ministry of Railways. 
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of trains. 
The railway company has for years what to do, given that it needs to check the axles of trains ICE much more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on ICE in the central railway station in Cologne. 
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the United States. 
After the case of the chief Josef Ackermann of the new US: the German bank Deutsche Bank " must pay a fine amounting to millions. 
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant sector caught up in the US: the institute in Frankfurt pays compared 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis. 
It is the sale of mortgage documents. 
The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to the big banks a series of charges, and encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks. 
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom. 
"We are pleased to be able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiate a procedure in court," said a spokesman of the Deutsche Bank in New York. 
The Bank has acknowledged no fault comparison. 
This applies also to Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of an amount of $20.5 million. 
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz has welcomed the concessions of the two banks. 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and it intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits of customers. 
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage of several billion dollars. 
Comparisons now are the first of their kind. 
The regulator has also taken other major banks and he summoned before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. 
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents "Mortgage Securities." 
Credit institutions are at the base. 
When the housing bubble US erupted in 2007, it was fatal for a large number of banking companies. 
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed. 
Even if the events are already a few years ago, at the moment it is blowing on the US banks a wind storm. 
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to obtain compensation or to punish breaches. 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints. 
It accuses 18 major international banks, two financial house US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac " benefit in kind in mortgages of about 200 billion dollars. 
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, several operations of a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007. 
The supervisory authorities are demanding that the Frankfurter addresses "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum. 
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and says it wants to defend itself. 
Warren Buffett is growing by 10 billion IBM 
Buffett, the guru of finance, has invested huge sums in IBM's IT company. 
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than 10 billion dollars. 
So far the largest American investor Warren Buffett says repeatedly not to invest in IT computer companies, given that the long-term evolution of societies reveal that bad prognosis. 
However, he read the reports from IBM and has changed his opinion on the investment in this sector. 
He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes mainly benefits of services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies. 
An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as an attack in the world of finance. 
IT IBM gives itself the right to call "Mr IBM." 
Because Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic issue, that it has bought since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion. 
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent. 
Buffett said that IBM has never heard anything of this commitment so far. 
He congratulated the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits. 
"You have done a great job," said Buffett strategically. 
IBM for some time on the lucrative services IT as a " exploitation of accounting centres. 
The pioneer of computer science, old more than 100 years, offers both Software and consulting business calculators very efficient. 
Buffett had hitherto rather avoided technology companies. 
He says that he only invests in companies that he understands the business. 
But instead Buffett tackles over rail cargo, manufacturers of lubricants and machinery. 
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück of Munich. 
The 80-year-old 81 years had resumed in the 1960s " the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and had built one of the most prestigious global enterprises, thanks to smart investments. 
But his lifestyle is modest. 
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world. 
His almost unerring sense to earn money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha." 
After the announcement of the Buffett investment IBM shares have risen by one percent on the stock market. 
"Big Blue," as is also known as IBM, has a market capitalization of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world. 
For Microsoft, Buffett, he does not want to participate. 
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend. 
The threat is palpable 
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media are skeptical of the rule of law. 
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," renaîtrait now. 
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context. 
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern. 
Because for many German-Turkish spectrum believed dead for a long time: since the Mölln arson attacks in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been violence comparable with the right-wing extremist backdrop against the Turks. 
There is in Germany, it has never been discussed. 
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals that the dimension is far from predictable. 
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology," "that was the title of the publication on the Internet in the Turkish newspaper" Haberturk ." 
The newspaper 'Sabah' points out that one of the authors would have been a man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire. 
It is calmly responded the Turkish community in Germany: it has called this weekend for a silent commemoration for the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate. 
It is only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought at a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the agreement of German-Turkish recruitment. 
It is with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story. 
The reports of some Turkish media are a slap: "The gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary" that is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders. 
The German release of "Hürriyet" does not deprive clear conditions. 
"It starts at puer," this is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci. 
It points out that people have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. 
The action of the police has been seen very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they subsequently discussed the success of their research. 
 Why it has not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities searches in some suspicious right-wing circles, surprised the authors. 
More than one is prepared at least rhetorical or drastic ways: "If the case continues to be botched, there will be nothing other than self-defense and weapons." 
"It will be the best self-defense." 
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," wrote "Selen." 
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have clearly explained. 
The picture of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory. 
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, what mistrust and distance by acts of violence could erupt. 
The attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community. 
Never repeat the mistakes of the past 
In the past it was the failure of German policy after the attacks, the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. 
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish state, has been represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how much taxes produced the local population. 
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of their tax burdens. 
The current Turkish media report demonstrates once again how the distrust of many of Klempp Turks is deep in the state of local law since that date. 
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and reassessment of the far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is this time. 
The bank scandal of Lake Zurich 
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland. 
UBS has almost collapsed in the financial crisis and in the meantime patina of a crisis. 
It is a German who must now lead. 
It is certainly not what Axel Weber was imagined. 
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was informed in July that it would be in 2013 a position almost as spectacular: President of the Council of Administration of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career. 
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and kind comments on future colleagues. 
"UBS has succeeded the Turnaround." 
"I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel." 
And yet, from the month of September, it was clear that everything was going to change. 
A UBS securities dealer in London diverted all security systems of the Bank and had approximately 1.7 billion euros. 
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave. 
The Chairman of the board of directors of UBS is seen as suffering - and all asking: when Axel Weber is it finally? 
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012. 
And it will resume the presidency in May - not in 2013, as provided by the bank on Tuesday. 
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult. 
It is not a banker, much more Professor d " economy and President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed a period of adjustment. 
Suddenly he is assuming responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "the biggest bank scandal in Europe." 
Indeed, UBS is a huge part - until recently, it was the biggest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it patina for years of a scandal. 
Nothing, it seems, is the proud Swiss bank. 
It started during the financial crisis. 
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation. 
The image of the Swiss manager of assets, silent and sound, but also clever, it had combined with ambitious goals: it wanted to also become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank. 
UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world. 
On the other hand, it was advanced as a bank of investment in the league of the largest banks in the world. 
This made sense. 
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students." 
"In the current context, one wonders: how is it that I could simply be mistaken at this point?" 
It is profoundly wrong. 
In 2007 it emerged that for the first time something amiss at UBS. 
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was considered previously as a senior intellectual as well as a brilliant banker. 
A few months later why he was gone. 
The division of the bank had soared with sub-prime documents and a cross on billions. 
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross. 
For this reason it has indeed found investors, but that little time before, would have furrowed eyebrows: a transparent bottom of Asian state from Singapore and an Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it has never even learned his name. 
It was only the first blow. 
In April 2008 it has worsened. 
The bank was to announce losses worth billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland, withdrew. 
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS, given its investment errors in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. 
The national bank bought UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which she could become co-owner of the bank. 
Switzerland has been shaken - because it noted how it can be dramatic for a small country, so big banks. 
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). 
"We have not been able to save UBS again," said the bank researcher, Geiger. 
After the first disaster was followed by the second. 
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and is ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the tax authorities, perhaps with the help of the Bank. 
In addition, it has accepted a payment of 780 million dollars in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine. 
UBS has more or less published that it had helped to tax fraud. 
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion. 
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same. 
It followed the removal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors. 
And the exodus of client money. 
The bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business lines: investment banking because of bad speculation and the management of assets because of tax fraud. 
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as we thought, that UBS would get back, he followed this unfortunate story of merchants: a single merchant is surging 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticing that something amiss. 
And it publishes: risk management in investment bank that does not work. 
"With the Adoboli case, it was found that the risk control too little," said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich. 
The financial director of a large German bank says: "The problem of UBS is that it has no control of the risks." 
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken their function to become guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too great risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic. 
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for a particularly noble chocolate. 
UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little more. 
Already, the situation is classic. 
The Bank has its seat at the railway station in Zurich, which leads directly to the railway station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains. 
The buildings here are prestigious, retail rents are among the highest in Europe. 
Watchmakers like Tiffany's, midway between the Swiss traditions stores like those of the Sprüngli confectionery. 
For centuries the Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks like Julius Bär. 
It arrives in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door. 
Inside, walls are sheathed in marble, with thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for "safe." 
UBS knows what the client here: security. 
This idea of the Swiss bank has ruled out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank. 
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, ultimately like all Swiss bankers with the two big banks. 
UBS would become far too big, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are also prevalent. 
The Swiss would have nothing more to say. 
"And even if they have long been adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons." 
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that has changed the UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the big Swiss bank. 
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008. 
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "the crash of UBS." 
With up to 68 billion francs around 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the bankrupt bank. 
How this could happen? 
If you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS. 
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have entered into a huge group. 
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Swiss - and has been steadily increasing. 
What has helped is that the two prédécesseuses banks UBS completed: a rich bank, but lethargy with strong management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly more internationalized. 
Suddenly, the international investment banks have had access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. 
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS, Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors. 
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel was a dream team," said the researcher from banks, Hans Geiger. 
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very good models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive, which has blazed a path to the summit with the learning of the bank." 
But Ospel would face " at the end to Wuffli. 
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought that his models were the reality," Geiger said. 
"This is a tragic fall." 
Tragic, perhaps. 
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. 
The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the leaders' meetings during which the leader of the group Wuffli has always delivered the same watchword: displace Goldman Sachs. 
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. 
It has commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which have documented the success of the banks at this time. 
After all, UBS wanted to climb above. 
Some steps have already been successful. 
In case of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role. 
Business advisers, who have been responsible, have pointed out, however, a weakness: in the international operations of interest in the banking jargon "fixed," there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks. 
UBS would have shortcomings in US mortgages. 
To fill this gap, UBS has launched an adventure, which has almost cost. 
Hungry for growth, it is also the bank itself that a fund management created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested. 
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and put the documents of value based on mortgages in the US - but which has also retained risks. 
Even when other banks have long sought to get out. 
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought here," says Geiger, the banking expert. 
The euphoria over the fall is brutal. 
A manager after another had to leave, when put an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought. 
Positions at UBS became ejection and are up to now bancaux. 
Anyone who runs the large bank has an almost impossible task. 
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared. 
The bank researcher, Geiger has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of assets, return to the Swiss roots. 
But the bank does not (yet) go so far. 
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as much as it is clear now. 
On Thursday the head of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy. 
The Italian Swiss aged 51 years was only supposed to be temporary when the bank has surprised his predecessor Grübel. 
In the meantime, it has imposed: it must conduct a sustainable business of UBS, reported Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. 
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank to the state of play in the middle of the 1990s. 
It cancels 3,500 jobs. 
But it will not be enough. 
UBS needs a vision. 
Who is it? 
What does it want to earn money? 
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked. 
He said publicly until now only that he would seek with his wife an apartment in Zurich. 
Next year.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from banks. 
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, did confirm this caution: "Is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC. 
As a result, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.

Smart crows spread in cities 
In many places, rooks are regarded as "oiseaux° problem" but experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer chasing cities for a long time. 
Some love, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible; crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of the animals. 
An antidote against the "°problème bird" is not yet in sight. 
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts have said that this is no longer possible to hunt the rooks of cities. 
Experts from across Germany deliberated on possible solutions. 
They are looking for alternatives in cities 
The protectors of nature makes the problems of cities on the exodus of rooks particularly protected: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroy traditional vital spaces. 
Hunting, landscaping and tree typical eggs made life difficult for birds. 
Crows are under the protection of nature. 
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of eggs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen. 
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region. 
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with cudgels particularly brutal. 
"Normal expulsion, ousting, does nothing," said city planner and landscape, Werner Klöver. 
The destruction of nests using water under pressure or trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. 
"Animals away, large colonies divide and disperse in other places." 
The drive is conceivable only in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools. 
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer kill them." 
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner. 
Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a aversif packaging and aggressive offers to relocate. 
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens tried "info signs chainsaws" in order to establish relations completely different: "We can finally withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence." 
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger journey - educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, signs advising on the lives of these highly intelligent rooks. 
This project has now been adopted by tourists. 
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is a lot of communication, these birds have much to say." 
The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: the rooks are not only working tools to reach a beauty, but they manufacture their tools as instruments of work. 
Éthologistes of the University of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, how is the intelligence of the birds. 
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to toppling scaffolding with stones to achieve a larva. 
Without much training, they recognized déterminément that a stone had to have some size and shape to sink the platform. 
In a second trial, clever crows had to solve a problem more chunky. 
In a cylinder vertically placed, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva. 
The birds could not reach their spoils with their beaks. 
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal. 
All four animals were a hook with which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe. 
Three of the four rooks are even from the beginning.

The mass slaughter 
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: Intimate History of the First World War (" beauty and grief: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that give you the heart. 
A council to start: carefully tear up this page and make your mark - page. 
You will learn to know these people in great detail. In this narrative fiction of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war. 
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. 
It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature. 
He wrote a book outside that he described, accurately, as "a book of history." 
It includes a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment. 
This is not so much a book about what happened, he says, that a "book describing how this might look like." " feelings, impressions, experiences and moods. " 
"The beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists there, doctors, paramedics and sellers. 
Some will become heroes. 
Other prisoners of war, some will lose members, will become crazy or lose their lives. 
Their lives reeling here as the candles of a church: while some are suppressed, revival. 
The book by Peter Englund departs from the traditional history books. 
It brings a denial to the idea that the First World War is that the terrible war trenches on the Western Front. 
"The beauty and sorrow" skillfully described other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa. 
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem. 
This book is moving from the first page. 
The war took the lives of these people as a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina pue the cordite explosive. 
When gun shots are heard in the distance, and that you are a mother at home, are you or evade you? 
Who will come anyway? 
Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. 
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been amplified by assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors." 
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the fleet of high seas. 
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published. 
The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small isolated moments and details. 
Most tackle deprivation and the ability to get away. 
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz." 
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, bandages paper, wooden buttons." 
He goes on food replacement in Germany. 
He describes the "meat made of rice cooked in fat mutton (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco with dry roots and dried skin potato; soles of wooden shoes." 
He says that "837 permitted substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are 511 alternative cafes." 
Some stories deal with honour and courage. 
An American acknowledges its own drive against the savagery and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your empesée shirt and cloutée. 
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it likely to die, and that nobody will notice or pay attention. 
"When you are resigned to sacrifice themselves, we hope to have an audience," he wrote. 
It is unfortunately rather akin to "a condemned man strangled in secret." 
Other observations about the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror. 
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a story of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the factories." 
It captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the aviary at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-articulated and convinced ideologically, clothing, which carries out its butchery while being seated behind a desk." 
People act unexpectedly; there are so many basic behaviours of heroism. 
Peter Englund speaks of the soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front. 
"We find the most grotesque expression in trade was due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and cover the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote. 
"The most desperate eyes, which translates into a lifetime blindness." 
In the Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity. 
In dozens of short scenes, it captures the way the war has "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion." 
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders have a war. 
The best books of the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (the Great War and Modern Memory) Paul Fussel, or "nothing new," Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete. 
The book by Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon. 
The end of the book is the most damning that I read in a fictionnelle. 
I am not going. 
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized your hands this page listing people and burned with a match. 
After a false start, a carefully planned operation 
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing riot helmets. 
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be empty. 
The operation remained secret from everyone except a few senior officers as well as other informed at the outset that they would carry out an exercise. 
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department. 
There could be no repetition d " episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators, who went against the settlement of the department and have created a storm of public sympathy for the demonstrators. 
The operation to clean up the park Zuccotti demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training. 
The police were prepared by observing the occupations in other cities. 
A crucial exercise was held on the island of Randall, in view of the operation in the Zuccotti park. 
Police officers receive better training against the riots - counterterrorism measures that are to move quickly to a large number of policemen - to concentrate on the area of Lower Manhattan. 
The last training session took place on Monday evening, from the Manhattan side of the East River. 
The orders to move into the park reached "at the last minute," said one man, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise." 
"The few policemen that I know and who have been called did not know they would go to the Zuccotti park," said the anonymous person. 
"The only ones to know that they are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department." 
The city has managed to learn a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation. 
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park, but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans. 
The operation Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to neighborhoods particularly criminals. 
Mr. Kelly said that many people would come and go in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants 1am was a favorable schedule. 
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had fewer people," he said. 
Vehicles of the emergency services equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening. 
The lights and recorded messages resounding loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters. 
While the community affairs officers entering the park with their wind-breaker light blue, many demonstrators have simply brought their business and political parties. 
No attempt has been hit before 1h45 said Police, which has left time for the occupants to pool their business. 
Other police teams have been sighted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed. 
Journalists inside the park have been forced to leave. 
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that this measure had been taken solely by security. 
But according to many journalists, police would be unable to observe the intervention inside the park, severely restrained by the officers. 
Mr. Browne said that the trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images. 
While the police moved westward through the thick undergrowth of demonstrators, including luggage, the plastic lawn and leaf bags of clothing, teams from the Department of Sanitation, cleaning up everything that the occupants left behind. 
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards. 
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park. 
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically. 
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp clung together. 
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly. 
The emergency services were called to cut the locks. 
No arrest has taken place in the park before three-thirty said Mr. Kelly. 
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and fifteen minutes later. 
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people have been arrested in the park. 
Most "disturbing public order and rebellion." 
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the senior officer to be found on the scene. 
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the Department of detectives, was also present. 
Mr. Kelly, although now, "was not managing the operations," said Mr. Browne. 
A second group of police officers patientaient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the event of intervention. 
Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south. 
It saw the Police widen the perimeter far beyond the Zuccotti park. 
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away. 
Nearly 28 people were on the north side. 
One of the most serious actions of the night took place in the south of the park. 
At around 5 am, south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the folding of a police car; others have been seen punching tires of a police truck. 
At one point, a piece of plywood has arisen in the crowd. 
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized. 
The union of school aid is suing the city for redundancies 
The union representing hundreds of school aides who have lost their jobs last month plans to launch Wednesday a trial in the city for discriminatory and unnecessary redundancies, the impact is disproportionate on schools with disadvantaged schoolchildren. 
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, to try to cancel the redundancies. 
Six hundred and seventy-two school aid coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the less well paid in the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October last year. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political revenge for not having left the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have made it possible to close the budget gap in the spring. 
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation. 
At a hearing of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott's Quarry said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June. 
A member of the Council has responded, stating that the redundancies of school aid were not specified in the budget. 
The officers of the 37th District Council have said that they would notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit to the Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
Dennis Walcott's quarry and the Department of Education of the city will be the defendant, the plaintiffs will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all black or Latin American origin, like most school aides who have lost their jobs. 
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and cannot comment on the allegations. 
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would capitalize on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest parts of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a regular underfunding. 
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and some barely in the institutions of Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school aides have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts districts south of the Bronx. 
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claim that "this is not an area of wealthy parents who can get funds to fill the budget gap." 
The budget of the public school has been reduced from 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each registration disadvantage. 
The union contended that the directors of schools have been misled by certain words in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents. 
The memo was using the term "surge" to describe the action, even if "excess" described more generally move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. 
According to the complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been made redundant," and "not only because of excess." 
Mission: Congress is an agreement on the issue of Libya 
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya. 
It took a successful uprising, the capture and the death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the American involvement. 
The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their uprising and the American troops for their "courage." 
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry. 
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations." 
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far. 
This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions to approve or not the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya. 
In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya. 
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate. 
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya. 
The US mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug. 
The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events. 
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. 
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. 
The Senate can now act. 
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulate the Libyan people for their courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the Armed Forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and great professionalism." 
The resolution says "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya." 
The new measure will win the support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or divide legislators like last June? 
Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the final version. 
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project. 
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats. 
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a vote in the House or the Senate. 
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments, but it is not without having tried. 
The amendment Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been presented to Congress on a wide range of subjects. 
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent. 
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful "control federal spending." 
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to soften their CV - the chance to boast of being "the perpetrator" of such a measure. 
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in August called for the House and Senate vote on the amendment for a balanced budget. 
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. 
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates in which the members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents. 
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects. 
An amendment banning marriage between same-sex is proposed, just as the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag. 
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states are opposed. 
As eager as were members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past. 
During the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th. 
The pace slowed from the early 1990s, when members were generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the library of the Senate. 
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today. 
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. 
"Massacred but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting 
Ten months after a gunman fired at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona emerged Monday evening in a television broadcast, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and has said it wants to recover rather than return to Congress. 
During his appearance in the news "20/20" on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form sentences and needed help to walk. 
The issue has approached its difficult return following the ball that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head. 
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling. 
In his first television interview since the January shootings, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called his recovery "difficult." 
After Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather well." 
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special one-hour edition of "20/20" broadcast on the eve of the release of the new couple's book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope." 
The special issue has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shootings on 8 January. 
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he sits on his hospital bed, his head flattened and a large scar on the front. 
It is to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband. 
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions. 
A sign of the head. 
A movement of the lips. 
And finally, his first word: "Whatever." 
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast. 
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: there's Representative sing with doctors Cyndi Lauper "Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "free Fallin"? ." 
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with doctors, said they did not remember the shooting. 
According to her husband, he was read an article about the shooting of 12 March when she was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident. 
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treated pending the trial. 
"There has been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer. 
"Hard, hard, hard." 
During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten." 
"So I would say," Gabby, you have not been beaten, " said Mark Kelly. 
You have just been massacred. 
And you'll get through, restore and come back even stronger than ever. 
More pity than respect for the troops 
The event: a gala on Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the New York City. 
Kid Rock sang a ride on impotence, frustration and loss. 
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. 
The crowd in tie is standing on its feet to cheer. 
"The military men and women are seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the fundraising in the spring. 
A senior military officer present at the gala, which was also attended Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in different ways. 
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," wrote the top military officer in an Email. 
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. 
I know. 
But this was not just a pity. 
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and an American public passionate but often distant. 
Praise is lavished on the troops for their sacrifices. 
But they have a certain price, say a few soldiers. 
The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform. 
"We are not victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan. 
"But it seems that the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds." 
This is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to seem grateful or disagree with the public they serve. 
They realize that the anger of troops returners of the Vietnam War has been much worse. 
Thus, most conversations about the pity in confidence among the veterans. 
After the return of his two sons in the battle with the Marines, Colonel retired Mark Cancian has warned that the public would see their service from two perspectives. 
Some people would watch with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and traveled to faraway places. 
Others are asking whether "a veteran angry and violent lies beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington. 
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who talks called subtle if he would be able to keep under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from combat. 
"When you raise the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons. 
The military difficulties, in part, from the American indifference to the wars. 
Victories are rarely appreciated by a country unfamiliar with the army, which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
"As a nation, we no longer cherish the heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan. 
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military. 
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries. 
The army faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists 
This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction on rape. 
If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next. 
The soldier of 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she was raped by a soldier. 
C " was in October 2008. It returned to its barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers. 
He was asked if he could join in his bedroom to drink a glass. 
"C" was a wake-up call, " says Elizabeth Lyman. 
But the Texane has set aside its concern. 
I thought: no, it was 19 years old. 
"It is Texas," she said. 
"I had to follow my intuition." 
A few minutes after entering the House of Elizabeth Lyman, the man grabbed her from behind, thrown on the ground and raped, claims. 
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and not others, will wait anxiously for the decision of justice in an historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial brought against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. 
They are accused of failing to halt the spread of rape in the military, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers. 
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial was initially 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers; they claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks. 
Susan Burke says military galonnées, because the problem starts with them. 
"The army is a vertical structure," she said. 
"Who are the individuals in the position d" eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders. " 
The lawyer also says that since the month of February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future prosecution. 
His strategy: instead of bringing together all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all his eggs in the same basket - it will start a trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure. 
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by the US attorney Neil McBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. 
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries in the armed forces. 
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries to staff in active service. 
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants" indicate the documents. 
The Department of Defense has refused to make any comment. 
Things have changed since the 1950s. 
While women have still not, officially, the right to go to war, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male. 
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, especially to enter into contact with local women. 
The result: in these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two-thirds in combat. 
It is time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke. 
It is not alone in this battle: three other trials are underway. 
At the Yale Law School, the centre of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere. 
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to the victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network for military women), a group for human rights. 
His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with the requests for benefits for those who have been victims of a sexual assault in the service. 
Nine bills independent of each other have been presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions. 
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults have been recorded in the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense. 
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, according to its own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure represents approximately 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents this year. 
The report published in March is also looking at the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the army have been the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system. 
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke described their assault as the first of a series of injuries. 
In the case of Lyman, she informed the military of rape less than an hour after the fact. 
That night, she said, he was asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders. 
She has undergone a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed. 
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, a trial in which it questioned his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of its aggression. 
Six people have testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted. 
"I remember the day when the verdict was made," says Elizabeth Lyman. 
"I thought that I was going to begin to have contractions. I am yelling at the court." 
"I have been placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember having told my commander," it was not his trial but mine. " 
Elizabeth Lyman has been forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who has come to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. 
In January 2010, it has been referred under less than honorable terms, preventing him from receiving any benefit. 
Does the case Lyman and other complainants will or not, it is a long history, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington. 
However, he says, "in my opinion, they should be able to move forward." 
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict. 
I have always criticised the Feres doctrine. 
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility. 
"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try," he said. 
These things change only when the right have the will to fight. 
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, will bring together hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials. 
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue so that there will be no reform," she says. 
"What we would, either of the two options. 
The walls have eyes: researchers study on Facebook 
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy expressing his anti-immigration views online. 
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been made a killing in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial. 
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups on social networking sites. 
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to learn more about these people. 
But how do we find? 
Easy... so log you on Facebook. 
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a report published recently by the think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe. 
Facebook is full of personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way in which the marketers are doing so for years. 
The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe, it has targeted with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invite users to respond to an inquiry. The questions were asked about their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism about their own future. 
Coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have interviewed 10,000 supporters of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office. 
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett. 
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young and against immigration. 
But surprisingly, "those who combine activism online and off-line are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen." 
The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists. 
Think-tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "I love," publications on the walls and updated statutes. 
With more than 800 million active users who add content per day on average, the "data we call supernovae" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research that the name of the site appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years. 
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not walk in the street. 
"Before, when you try to carry out investigations into the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify." 
"You have to go to the party, but they have never allowed to enter," says Jamie Bartlett. 
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information." 
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and treat health and social problems. 
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits while intoxicated had a lot more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students. 
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help possibly a student whose status would speak too often. 
"You can't deal with a problem if you do not diagnostiquez," Dimitri Christakis, coauthor of Megan Moreno and director of the centre for health, behaviour and development of children at the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. 
"We know how to identify children at risk, and in another case not recognized." 
Facebook also constantly accessing information from its users. 
The site team has studied the statistics concerning the situation lover and the day of Saint Valentine, the rate of participation in the midterm elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to the only available information - the champions of the digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes). 
But users of Facebook know that the site that they like or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to have access to your information. 
But what happens when users of Facebook are part of an investigation that they have not even heard? 
While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, it is anything else online. 
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn's, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, according to a study in 2006 that he has been looking at the Facebook walls of his students. 
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends." 
Then comes the question of methodology. 
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest. 
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user. 
"What you say about Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn's. 
That is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn's believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used. 
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with the people," he said. 
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not in front of a computer." 
"Cold and inhumane": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik 
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has admitted having organised the two attacks that have been 77 deaths in Norway this summer, was described as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial which is taking place in Oslo. 
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temple of Norway," he says before a courtroom full of 500 people. 
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject, because your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism." 
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty." 
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions." 
For the same reason, he has refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing. 
Judge Nesheim has also asked the Police Breivik detain 12 weeks, he was forbidden to talk to the media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. 
Thirty relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing. 
Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in their eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars. 
All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial. 
"I have found cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK. 
"I was not comfortable, but I have a little advanced after having seen and heard the suspect." 
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, he looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eye by entering and leaving the court. 
Despite the bizarre idea that Breivik belongs to a broad movement of "resistance," the judge has determined that he was not crazy; he also said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices. 
The attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, resulting in criticism - absolutely not perhaps some. 
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation. 
"I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case," said a parent of a victim. 
"It would have been much easier." 
Seven lessons from the interview lost Steve Jobs, the film this week 
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - characterised by the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer. 
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview with Steve Jobs recovered recently and which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products. 
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. It had a hippie, but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a ameliorative charts - a man who believed that many business leaders had a "disease suggesting that a brilliant idea is 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a brilliant idea for a product of exception." 
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series chronicles the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation. 
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet. 
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says that the main copies have been lost in transport. 
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director. 
This video, slightly bulging, is the basis of the 68 minutes film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday. 
For someone known to hate depth-interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose technological philosophies and business strategies. 
And incredibly attentive. 
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer. 
There are also moments when perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where he seems anxious to hear the issues of Cringely, giving him shots of elbow to speed up and move to questions or issues of greater importance. 
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient about Lost Interview: Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other businesses and expressed its own vision on the future of computing. 
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something inspiring about the man that we see here, the anxiety dreamer on the eve of greatness. 
He has a vision of how things can be and should be. 
He said then. 
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview: 
On the way in which he has learned to run a business: 
"During all these years, I have always asked:" why are you doing things? "And the answers are always the same: ' Oh, just because we need to do." 
No one knows why, no one is thinking about deep things in a company. 
This is what I discovered. 
Steve Jobs is giving details on its efforts to simplify accounting for Apple. 
Puzzled as to how the costs were recorded - it often begins with a "standard cost" assessed to nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs. 
The opportunity to play a round on the Pope: 
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "blue box" that he has created with Steve others - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and call free long distance. 
The device has been the subject of many written beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious. 
He describes how he and others have tested the box using a public telephone, and then connecting from one network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible. 
"We enveloppions the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you arrived a minute later to the public telephone," said Jobs, chuckling. 
"We were young and thanks to the Blue Box, we learned that we could ourselves create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world." 
We do not know much, but we have managed to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things; it was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have existed without it. 
Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful round that he and others have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by impersonating Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. 
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened. 
His love with technology (and Bill Hewlett): 
At the age of 12 years, the hunt for spare parts to produce a fréquencemètre, he wants the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and a quick phone call. 
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard. 
"This has had a remarkable influence on me," was the only company that I had seen at this stage and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated. " 
Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of the employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he found the "first ever desktop." 
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small CRT. I fell in love. 
The teenager was returned at HP and began to write programs for this machine. 
Improvisation of innovation: 
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a head. 
At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell a few circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer. 
Working at only 30 days of credit, he must deal with the assembly and delivery of finished devices. 
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse: 
"I remember big disputes... I yelled above arguing that it would take five years to produce a mouse that would cost $300] I have had enough, I went out and went to see a designer." 
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to make $15, which was incredibly reliable. 
Large companies that burn out: 
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share. 
"If you work for IBM or Xerox, you better copier or printer, and after"? 
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success. 
Sales and marketing can evolve, so it is these types of people who end up leading companies and staff are put to the gap in decision-making. 
The genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by those who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required. 
This is what happened at Xerox... 
Xerox could hold all the computer industry. 
It could have done ten times its current size, Xerox would have been the Microsoft in the 1990s... 
They have snatched defeat to victory. 
On innovation as an art form: 
"A huge amount of manual work between a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it is changing and growing." 
You learn a lot about its intricacies. 
There are compromises to do... some things that you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories, too. 
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling. 
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste; it is to try to explain the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product that you create. 
Picasso said that good artists copy and that the great artists steal. 
We have always been ashamed to steal good ideas. 
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional: the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, who were simply the best computer scientists in the world. 
Except for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area. 
Scalia and Thomas provided with opponents of the health law when the court meets 
The day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to examine the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama's health will be heard, two of its judges, Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been spotted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will defend the case before the High Court. 
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review. 
One of the cases in question concerned a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the reform of health care ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level. 
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental 5h30 argument is expected in March, and the result will probably contribute to the destabilisation of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at a time when the court's decision will be made. 
The lawyer before the court and argued on the rejection of the law, will probably be Paul Clement, who has served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush. 
The legal firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of the two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Fédéraliste Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles. 
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business). 
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. 
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the matter. 
There is, among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican of the Senate and opponent of the health law. 
The star invited to the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. 
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Fédéraliste Society for years. 
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. 
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges. 
If they were, they probably argumenteraient by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge can attend fund-raising organizations linked to the law and that the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the agenda of such an event." 
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two lawyers in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics. 
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court should respect the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. 
"The judges were drinking and were having dinner and a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court." 
Their presence and their participation in the fundraising of this event dismantle any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable. 
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste Society. 
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist profile. 
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas. 
Kagan was Solicitor General of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been brought to the level of the Court of First Instance. 
His critics have pressed for Kagan recused to hear the case, saying that it had too much invested in the defence of the law to be impartial. 
Kagan has given no indication that it would do so. 
Boeing has a record order of 18 billion dollars for aircraft 
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 passenger aircraft, with the opportunity to buy 20 more. 
Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion. 
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products. 
This is a case where the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and that the amount of these 50 had reached the record sum of 18 billion dollars. 
Equally incredible is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders for aircraft. 
In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2,520 planes for a total value of $450 billion. 
Over the weekend, Boeing was informed of the order of commercial aircraft the most expensive of its history - 50 Boeing 777 corridors. 
It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that has spent this gargantuan order. 
Boeing announced at the Salon Aerospace in Dubai in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which would increase the total amount of the order to $26 billion. 
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787 - 8, called Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers. 
The amount of these six devices more than a billion dollars. 
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst at Morningstar. 
"These clients in particular have an immense value." 
In the Middle East, the oil-producing countries have a lot of their airlines. 
They have therefore not only the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their most important costs - would be less harmful because the country would gain money with the rise in oil prices. 
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the oil price rises, said Dihora. 
"They have a natural hedge," he said. 
The order Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing wide-body aircraft and helps to curb the encroachment of the Airbus competitor with his plane A350. 
The victory of Boeing in aerospace show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777 - 300ER. 
Airbus postpones its inception to increase the surge in demand from its customers to increase its capacity and autonomy. 
The actions of the Boeing Company rose 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars. 
The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the election of Michoacán 
Maria Luisa Calderon says that the drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the post of governor. 
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost his attempt to access to the post of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that the drug traffickers have helped his opponents. 
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo Institutional Revolutionary, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of governor of the state of the west. 
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections. 
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they stole ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and have forced people to vote" for the PRI. 
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years to lose the presidency in 2000. 
But he organises his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort. 
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. 
Vallejo appears to be outspoken Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day. 
Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the Party National Action, or PAN, has refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner. 
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential left divided and unhappy. 
Aureoles has also refused to recognize the early results. 
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any connection with the drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results. 
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialising in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. 
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006. 
However, violence has persisted. 
A week before the elections the PAN mayor was murdered while he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned the campaign by fear. 
However, for the PRI as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán, a victory will help the party in its momentum. 
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think that this victory is very encouraging for next year." 
LADS urges Asia to help the eurozone 
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy. 
Rajat Nag, the Director General of LADS based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growing in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. 
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside leaders and resources of Europe would avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy. 
"We are all together in this crisis." 
"Therefore anyone can help Europe to emerge from the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the Economic Forum World in Bombay. 
"Asia can be protected" at some point, but it is not immune. " 
"So if China and India can help, that nothing prevents." 
In recent months, the euro area has been severely shaken by a crisis of sovereign debt. 
Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian dangerously soared and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. 
The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has spurred the fear that the global economy falls into recession, and prompted the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area to find a solution. 
Mr. Nag has hopes that the IMF would provide any assistance, but he has also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the obligations of the financial rescue funds from the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater power in negotiations with the Asian partners in Europe. 
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone since its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a decline in arrivals of foreign capital. 
"Nobody wants the eurozone remains unstable and turbulent," he said. 
"We have monumental challenges ahead and we must maintain a high level of growth." 
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?" 
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich when they face their own major economic challenges. 
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, has said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid from Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less. 
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and that they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow," he said. 
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, has also asked why the reserves of India should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector. 
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia. 
Forecasts of LADS economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "the risk of loss" because of the European threat. 
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed "develop" contingency plans " to protect themselves from an economic downturn and massive leakage of capital. 
Severe warnings from the Pentagon about the potential cuts in defence 
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has upped the pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a chain reaction financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, from gatherings of civilians. 
The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts is imminent if the Congress does not reach an agreement on spending. 
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R- Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R- South Carolina. 
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in the so-called sequestration, would lead to 23% of reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects. 
"A significant reduction, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and our unfeasible construction projects - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other efforts to modernize," Panetta wrote to senators. 
"We would also have to separate a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians leave without pay in order to achieve the objective." 
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously alter our preparation." 
The cuts would affect possibly troops, continues Panetta. 
"Although funding in wartime contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets," said Panetta. 
"The contractor would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war." 
"The staff managing salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted." 
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence. 
"The result of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline in the US as the world's undisputed leader of the military power." 
"We are fiercely opposed to this drastic action," said the senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta. 
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one that we should impose." 
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen." 
The letter from Panetta and the recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. 
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even if he succeeded himself at the highest position in the Pentagon with years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices. 
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might occur - a military with a shell, but no core. 
"It is a ship without sailors." 
"It is a brigade without bullets." 
"It is a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots." 
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon. 
"It is a force depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries." 
"De facto, it invites aggression. 
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined specifically how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: deadline for responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk unacceptable in future combat operations." 
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning. 
The list included the Fighter F-35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new gunship coastline and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and navy. 
Put an end to the development and testing of the F-35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is an essential step to improve and respond to potential threats from China and other rivals. 
How can we identify a lie 
A look at the recent headlines indicates how deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life. 
The Republican nominee for president Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying. 
Penn State administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports a football coach retired sexually assaulted boys. 
Last week President Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. 
The lie has destroyed careers and country convulsé. 
The New York congressman and celebrity Internet Anthony Weiner, went for a fool by quickly issuing denials contradicted by evidence. 
The former candidate for the presidency John Edwards has been accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital affair. 
And then, no one who experienced history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky affair. 
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion. 
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to get on their assessments of performance. 
The mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. 
How much deception? 
On a given day, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies. 
In fact, many of them are pious lies. 
Another study showed that foreigners will lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. 
Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons. 
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to get who said: "I haven't been," the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search for such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology. 
One of the results of research is that the most ancient myths about the lies have been démystifiés. 
The liars you look in the eye. 
They are not bégayent, feeling or not always. 
Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover. 
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, facial expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time. 
I spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and still emerge from the knowledge of the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or management. 
Good liars are adept at reading others, comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them. 
We know from research that the extroverted lie more than introverted men say more lies "citizen-centred" while women say more lies "focused on the other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge). 
We also know that if you are seen as a calling, others will feel less guilty of lying to you. 
How can you tell if someone is lying? 
First, look at the normal behaviour of your subject. 
This is what is called "benchmarks." 
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring future changes. 
Look at the shape of your subject, laughter, voice quality. 
You need to know if someone normally hit his feet constantly in order to not launch unfair accusations when you see Slinging feet in the middle of the meeting. 
Then look for signs of misleading verbal and non-verbal behaviour. 
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of deception. 
Misleading people can stop the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can hold their feet to the door, leaning out, change significantly posture or present a relief "interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions. 
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview was completed just to try to trigger the reaction after the interview. 
Also, look at the vocabulary of your subject. 
The famous Scott Peterson skidded through the past while pretending that his wife murdered were alive, triggering a national search to find. 
Misleading individuals can also use a strong language: "I have not had sexual relations with that woman... Ms. Lewinsky's dress' or repeat entirely a difficult question. 
The most common verbal indicators are subtle. 
Someone can use a lot of "bush" in its response to a difficult question: "Well... to say... if I remember... to my knowledge." 
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag. 
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible. 
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by hustlers in their personal and professional lives. 
The controversial pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the US 
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the anger of unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project back on track. 
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the area ecologically sensitive dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win its approval. 
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol Nebraska. 
The official, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. 
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources. 
"It is a real way forward," said Terry Lee, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News. 
The new review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision. 
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and he expressed his support. 
The 2,735 kilometers pipeline extending from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. 
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries. 
To do so, it would cross six states. 
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have focused on the 20,000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline. 
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan have lobbied for a law to force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. 
The environmental impact study of the State Department has found that the project would have only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry has said that the Inspector General of the Department has ordered a separate investigation of the review process focused on two issues. 
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program.

Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly caused a young child to vomit in fear 
A family of New York says that the fat lady Disco Patti LaBelle embarked on a spate of violence in the foyer of their building in Manhattan, has terrified the girl to the point where she vomited in fear. 
The singer tirade "Lady Marmalade" has alarmed the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, so that she has suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners," said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
It was on 10 November last year when the scene technician Kevin Monk, his wife teaches kindergarten, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to travel with their families. 
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk snaked down in the foyer of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Geneviève in his arms. 
Roseanna Monk stated that she had stopped near the door and asked his daughter for a moment. 
"Somebody came up behind me and told me: ' Do you know what your daughter?" I said "yes" and I was looking for, " she says. 
LaBelle chastised with anger the pregnant woman. 
"She told me of an aggressive tone:" you should not let your daughter near the door, " said Roseanna Monk. 
"I replied:" what you say or do not want. " 
She became rabid and began to use expletives - the word " " and the word " " a strong voice... 
She had a bottle of water and began rained water from the bottle. 
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical. 
"I said to this woman:" look at what you did to my daughter, " said the mother of the child. 
LaBelle pounced on the mother - who was still in his arms - and had to be restrained by his entourage who was dragged into a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk. 
The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit," she added. 
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but has received no response. 
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle have not returned our calls for comment. 
The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity cancer for children. 
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct," said Mr. Davis. 
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with a child of 18 months." 
Adversity has slowed the economy 
During the first year of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy shrank 
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, called the change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity from the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. 
Temperatures in February, causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the economy of the state for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31,16% in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors. 
According to the report by the frozen allocations from the Mexican Council of Rural Development Soutenable, there has been damage of 582 million 835 hectares, including a 78.03 percent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21,07% have suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas. 
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the state during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rapid increase, because while the January to March, 55,000,053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53% of Population Economics Active, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28% and from July to September, the average has continued to raise up to $6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 sinaloens thousand unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand people 969. 
Less liquidity 
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy. 
"What we see is a rise in unemployment, which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in the Congress to combat the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars illegally is not easy as they work to earn, invest and use them in something," he said. 
Migration 
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor. 
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment rise," said. 
Lack of seriousness 
The analysis of the sinaloen labour market worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60,38% of the population in this state are working without pay as a worker with no social insurance institution. 
Unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the discrepancy is the low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare. 
The average monthly income of sinaloens workers was, until September, 5,000,352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos. 
Contraction of FDI 
The decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the greatest reduction of Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat for Economic Affairs from January to June the state's FDI reached 630,000,697, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to the 5,143,000 312 million recorded in the same period of the previous year. 
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State recorded a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, mainly by service sector companies. 
Debt 
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the state has requested in July at the congress public approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim to reactivate the economy, the approval of the Congress of the State has been to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November there has been no benefit of debt in any sector of the economy of the state. 
Reactions 
For the representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government. 
Miguel López Loredo, president of the National Industry Chamber of Transformation, said that in 2011 there has been no harmonisation of the wishes of the different sectors, below the Government of the State. 
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we need to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, it was necessary to align the efforts of all and especially the smooth already synchronized of this new government team, let us hope that next year is much better," he said. 
Economic sluggishness 
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have kept the economy of the state and restricts its performance and growth. 
"The fluxe low economic product of several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that is quickly enough to generate economic dynamism that makes it possible to have an acceptable level flows in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing far below expectations that we had," he said. 
Redefining the vocation 
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronale Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that you want to channel the state towards productive activities more dynamism. 
"In general terms we have observed that it has worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefined the vocation and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that we are out of place all the potential of the human and material resources of Sinaloa," he said. 
Much to do 
The Chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of future channels better efforts by the Government. 
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there has been some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programma," he said. 
He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the way of public policy. 
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard, and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said. 
Sentenced to 8 kilos of marihuana 
A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana. 
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic was informed that the small smuggler sentenced Omar Valenzuela Alexis Sandoval, for crimes against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for sale. 
According to the file PA/INS / / 687/2010/M - I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in the street Cipriano Valdez, number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato. 
The small dealer was travelling in a truck, white pick-up, in which he was carrying a black bag in the baggage of the vehicle and the co-pilot's place a small backpack, where the military has found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana. 
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for Legal Consequences regulations of. 
Debts to contributions to books 
The works of social contemplés in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished to register serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda. 
The Director of Social Development said that even if construction programmes have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes. 
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide the 25% and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their final stages. 
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end they gave nothing, even though since July they have given us a part," he said, "and we do not record delays, we started the works and we have achieved a lot, but we need the money." 
He mentioned that the past year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to seek a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the state had not provided at this time. 
"We had already suffered in the previous sexennal period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and programmes continue to function and this year, to be able to have access to these programs, we duu have the resources to cover what the state had not paid," détailla said. 
In spite of the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the authorities of the state to provide these resources, he said that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management that the corresponding percentages are as soon as possible. 
"They have to provide almost 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given nothing." 
The Court valid "analogue" in Mexico by 2015 
The substitution of analogue signales is one of the largest exchange rates that the world has suffered the last few years 
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advance the so-called "digital divide" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met. 
A minority of four ministers, attached the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital television. 
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force. 
The draft, drawn up by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, has proposed the declaration of the decree as constitutional, because of the fact that the rules on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve. 
The draft voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero. 
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and acknowledging complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by the government for the digital transition. 
The plenary session of ministers resolved also dismiss the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible. 
In his speech, the minister president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive branch cannot structure through general standards that the public administration is preparing. 
"I do not think it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," and he pointed out that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has constitutional mandate the direction of the state. 
The substitution of signales analog by digital signales is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and this is reflected in a better exploitation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels. 
Postponing the change, argued, would postpone the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security." 
These questions, noted, "require the operation of any establishes a system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution gives the power of the executive branch of the state." 
He recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already finished the digital transition, and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies. 
We cannot conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it provides in the administrative sphere laws issued by the Législative himself. 
The possibility of a "vote by vote" recount in Michoacán 
According to the data highlighted by PERs, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand total 74 minutes. 
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in relation to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Électoraux Results Program background (PER) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total. 
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (AEI), María de los ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal reforms in electoral matters. 
We will remember that Michoacán has not licensed nor its constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Act of Justice, while the Congress of the State has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline so that this trial can enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication in time by the Law of the Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had some objections. 
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Législative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to "sanction or challenge." 
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote," María de los ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the guidelines by the General Council of AEI it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counting of votes by the local electoral body. 
Thus, the partial count of votes, one or several electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the ballot box is not for the president; or there are obvious errors or alterations minutes. 
In addition, the total count of votes in all ballot boxes from the election can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the supposed winner of the election and the one who won the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; at the beginning of the session is a petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition that has presented the second of the candidates reported. 
The total count of the vote can be achieved if at the end of the joint statement makes clear that the difference between the supposed winner and the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a petition by the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, cases in which one will exclude the electoral packets that have been subject to the partial count. 
It is worth mentioning that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PPRD, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16%, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday 
The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster 
The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire euro zone. 
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government. 
It is expected that he presents a cabinet in its majorities by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post. 
Monti said that he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government. 
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists. 
Monti has not explicitly said that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome. 
The "framework is now well mapped out," he added. 
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to sustain. 
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders to recover confidence in Italy that had been affected. 
Underlining the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the instability of the markets placed the Italian BTP bond yield 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved. 
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot of this government." 
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy in this emergency situation. 
The chances of success of Monti have been greatly boosted by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis has forced to resign last Saturday. 
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good outcome," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party. 
The support of PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members opposed to the Government of majority technocrat, Monti. 
Parliamentary support 
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be reforms of unpopular austerity. 
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets. 
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by observing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster. 
Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and juvenile and women's organizations. 
He will end his tour of meetings on Tuesday night. 
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis. 
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt are now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister. 
Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the financial defences current euro zone. 
Monti said that his government should persist in future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that the politicians only give them time to implement the reforms before bringing forward the elections. 
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist on the fact that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure. 
Political sources have indicated that the mutual suspicions and disagreements between the parties complicate the trial to include political figures. 
The experience of Spain is superior to that of the Costa Rican 
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games. 
Costa Rica, only one of the 22 candidates participated in 50 meetings. 
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convened by the two countries for the friendly today, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium in San José. 
While the national champions of Europe, the number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, an extensive record of games selected class A, the Habs had only defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have 50 international matches. 
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández. 
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain intense activities in league championships and national Cup and disputes in European Cups and the Champions League. 
All this should add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup. 
The Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA. 
We see that the greatest record of the Spanish goalie Íker Casillas, who earlier Saturday against England (0-1 in London) equaled the record of former goalie Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings. 
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games. 
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona, 106. 
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside other ibérienne team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102. 
Loan centennial is Carles, with 97 games. 
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53. 
The Costa Rican side, and Michael Umaña are the left lateral Júnior Díaz, with 48 minutes and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45. 
After that, only five have exceeded 30 games: Keilor NAVAS with 31, with 32 Azofeifa Randall, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35. 
The least. 
Those who have less, with more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31). 
The national side, with less than 30 minutes, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and 23 Myrie Roy. 
The rest is not even 20. 
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson begins again. 
The historic striker of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27. 
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who has the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks. 
Quinteto includes the country in turn to celebrate two decades 
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality." 
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium. 
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will be a dream to happen in this country. 
Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva Brazil last week. 
The group is in the South American side of its tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its unique stopover in Central America. 
This day will be available on the National Stadium, from 19:30 hours, alongside the Group of Los Angeles The X and Las Robertas. 
This is an excerpt of the conversation, the full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet. 
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream: are you aware of what your fans live? 
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too. 
This is our second time in South America and Central and until now it has been awesome. 
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I think we can spend a few days. 
We émotionne our music there. 
I would ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live in the previous days. 
What is your message to your most ardent supporters? 
Thank you for staying beside us for all these years. 
There have been 21 years for us in Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry for the fact that so much time has had to spend up to this concert. 
Some people are already saying that the concert is the biggest show of the year. 
Does this adds a bit of pressure on your visit. 
Some of the greatest shows that we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks. 
We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has been for this concert in Costa Rica. 
We are very eager to produce. 
We love this country, we love to surf and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world. 
How have you discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfing? 
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there. 
My friends would always be surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, Mexico, are great places to do; it is that we have learned, through the gents who love surfing. 
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs. 
What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica? 
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions with regard to what we can do. 
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire. 
You never repeat the repertoire. 
What is this? 
I believe that this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everybody likes different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening. 
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have seen for a very long time, it helps to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we love these songs and that we can have forgotten. 
The show is more interesting for us and therefore I believe that it is also becoming more interesting for people. 
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory. 
Looking back, it is hard to believe everything that you have succeeded? 
Yes, absolutely. 
First, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a great rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years is that it seems a dream. 
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together we émotionne a lot. 
We love and we love to create music. 
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go. 
Things could be better for us. 
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge? 
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups. 
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. 
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is not very common. 
From time to time, a group of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out simultaneously in the same city. 
We are proud, and it is an honour for us to form part of the group in Seattle. 
We still play with some of them from time to time. 
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with them and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle that has emerged. 
It is also very strange that a group like your stays united and with the same members for so long. 
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and this is much more time than many groups normally. 
First, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are concerned for all the others. 
We are all close friends and that there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment. 
We trust each other with the music of everyone and it could get better. 
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want. 
How do you find a balance? 
As we grew up, it has been easier for us to find a balance. 
We make sure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of large masses and people who love your music. 
If you do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us not forget that we must respect the music and, without putting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which does not really interested in any of us. 
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone? 
I think we have written good songs and at the beginning it was awesome. 
We have been a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods). 
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little, and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him. 
He was a human being surprising and we lack. 
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica. 
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening? 
Yes, we sent videos with different proposals and this one was the group that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining. 
What you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live? 
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know. 
It is he who sings and I think that it does so with the first words he imagines. 
Like bassiste, what are its influences? 
There are so many... 
Among the first I remember Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... 
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on the bassistes that I love. 
How has Pearl Jam has maintained the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable? 
I believe that all of us feel a little disconnected from the word grunge. 
When I think, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have appeared at the same time, and if it is now, I think this is wonderful, because it is a music that is worthwhile to listen and groups like Mudhoney are now music better than ever. 
At the beginning, his music had a more obscure content, and now it has become more positive. 
What should this change? 
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End Just Breathe " qualified as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive. 
With the two, when Ed played for me, I cried when I have listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs. 
I think that if you richer and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, is that for me. 
I also believe that we can also be happy and even as it can be done to obscure music. 
Peru: 
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations 
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in magpies, informed his family doctor. 
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various ailments, enclosed a tongue cancer for which he underwent four times and which is under control. 
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Néoplasiques Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his limbs. 
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he wants because he feels innocent. 
He underwent four times cancer language, he has a loss of weight percentiles of 18 kilograms, and other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and traffic problems in the feet, said the doctor. 
Fujimori is serving the sentence since September 2007 in the National Spéciales Operations Directorate of the police. 
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army, which has operated illegally during the early years of his government. 
Mujica trip to Mexico to consolidate political ties 
An official procession, with head Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will introduce Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and deal with political issues in the region. 
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political authorities, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda distributed by the Uruguayan Presidency. 
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its Web page. 
According to the local media, Mujica is seeking to persuade Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes. 
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that has provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to this European country. 
Mexico chairs since November the G20, a group of developed and emerging countries in the world, and with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation. 
The Uruguayan government has tried the last few years to send the implementation of the agreements to exchange tax to get out of the "brand name knock-off list" of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries not to enforce all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters. 
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations. 
The plumber and mustache goes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land" 
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but it had never done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young stereoscopic technology. 
The title, which arrives this month to stores throughout the world, has been designed from the outset to exploit the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, which makes it possible to play in three dimensions without using glasses. 
"Mario is the man who must say as to operate the stéréoscopie without glasses," said the head of press for Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. 
Álvarez said that "super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo initially designed for this medium," because up to now successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of 3D time" was adaptations of existing titles. 
The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible" which allows a rapid and fluid part. 
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to garner less adept users. 
Once overcome, experts will be able to make a "second round" game, which this time are more difficult. 
In addition, users will be able to choose between an "aggressive" or that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions." 
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which no longer happened since 2005. 
In these video games Nintendo is a glance at the followers of the saga and repeat the successful formula of previous games, which lies in the fact that the plumber and mustache must travel platforms undermined perils to liberate Princess Peach. 
Even if I find new movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "feasible." 
Colom gives its approval to the extradition of Portillo to the United States 
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered for the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for conspiracy to laundering 70 million US dollars. 
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern countries calling for Portillo to judge. 
In a press conference, Colom said that his decision follows the independence of the judiciary and executive taking into account the fact that a Court of First Instance had already ordered his extradition. 
He said that during his term "it did not help" in any judicial resolution and he had given all the extraditions that he had known. 
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be deported for drug trafficking. 
What Colom has assumed executive action after having exhausted all constitutional and judicial bodies to judge the former agent for the period 2004-2004. 
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionalité (CC), Portillo should be extradited after he resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and having secured his human rights. 
Portillo has been absolute misuse of funds from Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reactivated the case. 
Trinijove has helped young people in situations of risk 
The entity was created to prevent the marginalisation of young people without training 
The results of the first 25 years of life of the body of Trinijove social support is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century. 
This is the centenary of workstations currently obtained by this social group. 
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in a celebrated act in an old industrial complex Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended. 
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people trained, without work, with addiction problems or marginalized. 
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of bodies and institutions in the 25 years have collaborated with the association. 
The varied political representation, in full election season, has shown the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove. 
Alongside the president of the Catalan regional government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Mr. Pujol, attended the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to Mayor and current councillor Eco-procurement Socialist Ricard Goma. 
Also present in the Great Room i Fabra Coats the current Minister of Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa. 
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult and also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis." 
The president has given Trinijove as an example to combat bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty. 
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work that it is doing," he said. 
Property occupied by squatters for holidays, evacuated 
The invaders had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, Balmes, 51 
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance 
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of the number 51 Balmes Street had ended. 
Twelve people have abandoned at midday yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they held celebrations désespéraient neighbours, by judicial order and without need for intervention by the police. 
At the end of the operation changed the lock on the door to prevent the situation is repeated. 
"From that day there will be a control of access," affirmât administrator. 
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited, overtook electrical and water, to paint the walls and leave residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages. 
The first three apartments were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted until two days and désespéraient tenants. 
Beside the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been affected. 
His owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that the occupation of the building his business has fallen 80%. 
The owner of the discotheque said that the invaders of the property was unfair competition, because they were selling drinks at three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10. 
In addition, the owner of local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbours for the noise, while, according to the Commission, the trouble was not caused by clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially the participants in the celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense the last few weeks, according to the neighbours angry over the area. 
The head of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that it has even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and nine months "forgive" the rent. 
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) has also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation. 
The chairman of the City of the PP group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to do away with the problems of living together and civility that it caused to residents and the degradation of the zone." 
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and that in some apartments there have been flights. 
It is in this sense that he added that "we must put an end to impunity and be ruthless against anti-social behaviour in the property." 
Yesterday, the Mossos (local police) evacuated a building we Barris. 
At 3.30pm the police moved into the number 35 Street Mount, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had found that four people gained access to the building. 
The four were arrested immediately. 
Park or mountain? 
The architects coincide on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy about the fees 
The municipal contest on 16 doors opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona 
In the middle of the 1980s, heyday of the already extinguished Corporation Barcelona Metropolitan (CMB), this Administration has printed posters to promote Collserola. 
The brochure described the mountain as the great park in metropolitan Barcelona. 
In addition, it also contained a comparison figures, with the Central Park in New York. 
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea). 
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea. 
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with pigs in the role of the Yogi Bear. 
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all gateways to Collserola. 
A door brings to the idea of park, no doubt. 
It is this, or someone wants to put doors on the field. 
The question is: Collserola: park or mountain? 
The competition, both in terms of its organization as a reflection on the town is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona. 
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elected officials speak when they see themselves in an elevator. 
And this is one of the few opinions on which three architects of Barcelona, university professors, are presented. 
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely. 
For Roldán, after addressing the littoral front "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the rhetoric of Ildefons Cerda, green blocks of houses has not been conducted. 
"It takes from the base that the larger park in Barcelona is the beach. 
Among other things for its accessibility. 
Collserola is more complex, "gave the verdict the architect for which the title of" Collserola "contains a" trap lexicon: "There is no need to think about them" such as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which we must act. " 
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils." 
The perils of "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience in the 1980s and has been in the area of the Forum, "his swan song." 
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build. 
"Limiting something means the next step," i.e., its excess. 
"We need to think about new instruments planning, planning, because the current reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP) ] can cause genuine disasters." 
More to the point, Modol felt that, by simplifying the region's El Valles Collserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, no." 
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat "must not be lost," thanks for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment." 
In addition, it meant that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the free ticket that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this looming technique must lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) that: "We, the architects, should only be an instrument." 
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the bases of the competition it lacks a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "We convened 16 cross-cutting competition - he said - in the mountains, but there is not a longitudinal reading and understanding the area as a whole." 
This is, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests. 
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the programme and definition with that of the architect of the gate. 
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Dalt Ronda should include, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green. 
Casino Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released 
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal proxy Red Casino gave forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail 
After 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal power Red Casino granted forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey. 
After the bombing of the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio García Gil, has published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic quotte for the mayor of Monterrey allows the clandestine operation of the home game. 
After public denunciation, the prosecutor's office has opened a criminal trial against the brother of the PANiste mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in pre-trial detention for 30 days. 
After four hours in front of the PP regulations of Patrimoniaux 3, he was transferred to the detention centre 1 Centre, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the state. 
He stayed there during the 49 days when he gave a second detention order after the officer prosecutors dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime. 
On 19 October he was transferred to the criminal centre Cadereyta alleged to have been singing with a million and a half of the owners of the Red Casino; but he has spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him. 
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza. 
On 25 October a restraining order has been issued by the Clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there were sufficient evidence confirmed to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as those relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gaming house in exchange for its operation. 
This Monday, the legal power of the Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom over the following hours. 
During the legal formalities, the agent of the prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and the home game was the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer has tried to withhold the name. 
By virtue of the record 197/2011 provides the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and later there will be no claim in the lawsuit against him; he will require no compensation for the damage and no punishment. 
After the hearing of the legal authority of the home game, at 15:50 hours ordered the immediate release of Bretón Larrazabal. 
The Clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, has moved up to the municipium prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his case would be classified. 
It will be the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued. 
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome discloses the details of the air accident in which has lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people 
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) was informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the ground complete integrity, without the pilot could try a hard landing. 
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly. 
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had contact with the ground, blades had contact with the trees at 25 metres where the unit has lost the fuselage." 
He was also informed of the fact that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel. 
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the area of impact do not provide the appearance of parts on the ground. 
"It was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact is structural. 
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transport. 
The soil was a pante from seven to 30 degrees of inclination. 
For the moment, the Secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible, but the investigation can last a few months, it may even last a year. 
In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services has ensured that the timing of the impact, the helicopter in the state Presidential Major worked in speed of cruiser and it happened on a bottom-up soft ground. 
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal functioning cruiser at the time of the impact," he said. 
During the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, has listed six important elements in the investigation: 
Visual flight: 
According to the normative aircraft, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground. 
Weather conditions: 
Reports in the AICM were adequate conditions for take-off, and that the aircraft was proceeding towards the boundary area between TE and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloud cover. 
Selected routes: 
It is likely that " cloud the crew has sought a zone of weaker and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca. 
Location of the impact. 
The details of the impact and the last registration of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there is no loss of control or alteration of the flight path. 
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a small area. 
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact took place on a lateral and the right path. 
The pattern of dispersal of remnants of the aircraft allows us to assume that the helicopter crashed on the ground in terms of structural integrity. 
It has not detected traces of fire or explosion. 
In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. 
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground. 
During the field work we found pieces of the aircraft at a height of 9,000,200 feet above the average level of the sea, the soil had a slope that runs from seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination. 
The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly désarticulé during his journey. 
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with the ground. 
After careful research in an area larger than the area circled around the accident, it has not found disperses pieces of the aircraft, which bears the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of integrity. 
MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity 
Social Insurance is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people; this is borne by experts from the NPI 
The Mexican Institute for Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that he is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, called the protocol " notion of obesity in children and adolescents' which will have the genetic markers associated with overweight. 
In a press release, the head of the Unit of Biochemistry Medical Investigation of Expertise Hospital National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants. 
This team is supported by experts and students from third round of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI). 
The investigation is invited to participate or not, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS Valle de México, where is the evidence for minors every Saturday from 8:00 pm. 
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity is taking place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente). 
Having achieved the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal). 
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and know the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify among children and young Mexican risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. 
As we celebrate on 14 November the World Day of the Diabètes, he mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires to food. 
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of heredity diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure. 
He detailed that Saturday will be applied to all participants of the anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and seeks to identify the people associated with childhood obesity). 
López Cruz pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight in the case of minors. 
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been an increase in the case of boys, 77% in obesity and in the case of girls 47 percent; as far as overweight has also increased dramatique', said the IMSS specialist. 
He said that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history. 
He was informed that on average, the Mexican has a 65% of Indian-American ancestry, a 30% and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight. 
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excess energy that it consumes (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat. 
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full evaluation of children, which makes it possible to detect if they are overweight or obese. 
However, he said that the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and arm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes. 
Information is managed in a confidential manner, doctors put in writing to the parents, which explains each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must do to prevent disease. 
López Cruz explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentary lifestyles, which is the lack of physical activity daily, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances. 
Another reason is the high intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrate (tamales - pâté of meat cornmeal wrapped in leaves of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic analysis in this protocol. 
Asphalt UNAM blackcurrants 
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature 
If the signales that the streets were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair around 200 thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ-resistant gonorrhea) of the UNAM, which has ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of bituminous pavement is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated. 
During its conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organised in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible for developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures. 
Nájera Herrera has estimated that this type of modified asphaltes could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and consequently, the training of blackcurrants. 
He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest share of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes and molecules with a molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give paved its characteristic viscoelastic behaviour. 
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added. 
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changed during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperatures, warns the specialist in chemical engineering. 
The FQ-resistant gonorrhea researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three involve asphalt. 
Among the most superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones drenched in asphalt and compacted later. 
Each of the small stones that form the layer, signalât says, is asphalt. 
When the vehicles are generating efforts, it allows that the forces spread very well in the streets. 
If we had modified asphalt, they are transmitted better, opinât the chemical engineers. 
On the asphalt layer, he said, a final layer called turnover layer gemstone, i.e., sand, which is also bathed in asphalt. 
As it is in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street. 
As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the layer of rotation also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated. 
The weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they affect significantly the performance of the asphalt layer. 
When the soil is wet, water spreads inside the layer is difficult, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore cassis. 
In the trial of a cassis, he said, the first blight is the film rolling and only later affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with proper maintenance programs. 
The member of the National System Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer must be always linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants. 
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the bitumineuses emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. 
What has failed in the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia? 
Analysis of the factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not get the crown of Miss Colombia. 
Valle is number 14 princess. 
Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia. 
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content themselves with being on the winning podium, wearing the crown of money and the band accreditation as a new Princess of Colombia. 
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department already 14 titles of Princess and Melina a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who found themselves close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Ayala Bellini (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). 
Now the big question that many people are asking is: 
What is he missed? Because the result represents the defeat of a favorite in each presentation showed that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen's Police and Best Visage Jolie in Vogue, credential by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who won the crown of Miss Colombia. 
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the vow to appoint Princess First is the fact that she was not satisfied with her answer to the question? " what was the book that marked and why? Posed by Martín MURILLO Gómez, the Literaria Carreta Leamos. 
This is the response of the candidate of Valle to this question: 
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that this is a form of culturaliser, definitely I think that the book that marked my childhood is" the Little Prince ," it is a fairly profound book. 
Now I read ' crime and Châtiment ," it is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called" blood ." 
This response did not like first because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly for not concretely how each book quoted was marked. 
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt quiet and happy with the outcome " the universe and wise, what needs to happen. 
And for everyone, please read a little, "the little prince" is a great book. " 
Among the assumptions that Valle was destroyed by patronage. 
A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favourite, enthusiastically applauded and the candidate who received the preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), "this has aroused the jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the stage." 
It was noted that in his first presentation in swimsuits at the beach Hilton and his two parades on the eve of the coronation. 
Even if the two parades she seemed self-confident, noted that she lacked the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. 
Ariel Osorio, journalist "como en casa" (like at home), Canal NCR said that the fact that Melina was designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price during the competition is not the crown of Queen." 
In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake. 
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest. 
This is why two days before the election, the international juror Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed with regard to the social needs of his country. 
"Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects," he says. 
It also speculates that Valle sinned by its flaws behind and fibrosis who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the board elected him as the candidate " naturelle' Beauty with a healthier body, good diet and exercise responsible. 
The initiator of queens Hernán Jorge Orozco studied acknowledges that Melina was not the best body, that it was better, "but his biggest problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too well known, he has left points on the last day." 
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the Cromos magazine considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle was the surgery that she had suffered. 
"Surgeries are good, but Valle has not been able to do. 
His body has never been his asset and it has lost because of this." 
For that price, the National Beauty Contest awards for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits has posed a cruel prediction that unfolded last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo Melina for not giving him the taste of the crown. 
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by designation of the National Competition. 
However, it will be in history as one of the queens that despite his dazzling passage by Cartagena, has not won the crown. 
This was the work of the Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano 
A dactyloscopiste of Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano'. 
The work of these officials is crucial. 
The past November 4, an ITC dactyloscopiste Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the FARC, "Alfonso Cano," contrasting his fingerprints. 
Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of " Eliazar disponibilité' González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation. 
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Chocó, where a lot of times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place in which the corpses were to be identified. 
The year 2000 was transferred to the capital of Valle and after appropriate courses, he specializes in fingerprinting, which is the study of skin friction, palms and feet. 
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had warned Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days. 
Something very great expected. 
Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira. 
He knew that he had to identify two corpses, and that it suspected that one of them was that of the man who headed the oldest guérrilla in the world, therefore asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Sáenz León (his real name). 
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media. 
He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more meagre. 
But fingerprints do not lie. 
Accompanied by a galtonienne microscope, ink, an undertaking the harvest and a lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card. 
His eye did not wrong: it was "Alfonso Cano." 
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader of the FARC. 
In search of the footprint 
For a Sijín dactyloscopiste in Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant. 
Many people know our work. 
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes. 
To identify the corpses, the dactyloscopistes supports the investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured. 
When caught, many offenders have false identity cards or have no documents. 
We are taking fingerprints and looking in the database. 
The researcher told that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get a safe full of jewelery and money. 
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he says. 
Fingerprints can also dismiss or confirm suspects in cases of homicide. 
Recently we found a man dead, with bottles of drink around him. 
Interlude of the investigation has determined that a parent can be suspect of the crime and an imprint on the bottle. 
Even if this number not guarantee that he is the murderer, this place on the scene of the crime. 
A dactyloscopiste of the ITC explained that extracted "the fingerprints of objects with physical or chemical reagents." 
When they appear, using an undertaking the harvest or a band to collect. 
Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the déclinquents database, or the Civil Registry. 
"The problem is that there is still a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert. 
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the television programme CSI. 
Like all that glitters is not gold, touch is not necessarily a footprint. 
However, it can be used, if it achieves the necessary confrontation. 
"Outraged" defy the authorities in New York 
Hundreds of demonstrators jumping to the Zuccotti camp. 
A lot of people have joined the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park. 
The movement's integral Occupe Wall Street defied Tuesday the authorities in New York in trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple. 
Hundreds of demonstrators tussle with the Zuccotti, where they wanted to get through a judicial order that allows indignés' to stand again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation by occupying a park north of the city, where there has been new judgments. 
"Our idea is that if the court allows us not to stand again in the place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the movement's spokesmen "Wall Street," Mark Bray. 
Bray explained that the response of indignés' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has come up to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp. 
In addition, the indignés' have occupied a new park at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, property of the parish of Trinity Church. 
At least for an hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the police came and arrested some protesters, even though she was unable to confirm the actual figure, Efe by the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had also spent handcuffs. 
The organization ensures that there are people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved as a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the police. 
In the meantime, the Zuccotti - which is a forum of private property - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing Tuesday during which we must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning. 
A few demonstrators moved previously wore and handing out copies of the judiciary and even the agents who were monitoring the place, which has caused some small affrontements', said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some officials have hit the demonstrators. 
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the Occupe Wall Street or to enforce " laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit demonstrators access to the park with tents or other properties they used auparavant'. 
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the demonstrators, to which he has, however, alerted to the fact that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and bags to sleep. 
The councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti, an operation during which arrested 200 people and which was decided because of the fact that the demonstrators violated law. 
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people came to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do harm to other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life." 
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, which accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression." 
"Wall Street" have also indicated that they do not think organized "big action" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which began on 17 September. 
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television programme of Noel 
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, it will come out in the television program "it's Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," rescuer "Baywatch," "Playboy" rabbit, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Noel Canadian television. 
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will emerge in the television program "it's Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary. 
CTV has now distributed images of the television programme in which Anderson, also known for its wide dissemination on the Internet a pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband this time, the Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, is dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting a doll representing Jesus in a crèche. 
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who presented recently part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph. 
Anderson and Peters, the special programme of Noel CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires Argentina's model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not himself away from controversy. 
Recently, Bublé called " pute' American Kim Kardashian for one of his concerts in New York. 
Japan renait after the earthquake 
GDP rose 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of decline in the beginning of March 
Since the month of March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, fragile even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second World War. 
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the loss to 300 million, a blow that, in spite of the difficult global context, seems to be mitigated. 
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used for closure: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate. 
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010. 
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of purchases of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. 
In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures for January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases. 
However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that calls to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from scratch. 
Japan woke up mainly due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP. 
This variable increased 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities. 
The stigma of the yen 
Tokyo was given to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become a "values refuge" elected by investors who are fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege hanging like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies. 
With a divided, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic slack is determined by the health of large technology groups. 
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September the assessment of the yen. 
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not drop the guard. 
"We must follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa. 
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of the member countries have presented in September clearer signals of economic slowdown. 
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are limited. 
Because it dropped four decimal points up to $100.4 points, compared to $100.8 in August. 
Eurozone has even been above the average, which is in the 100, dropping eight decimal points to 99.13 points. 
Athens is fueling doubts 
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment 
With the risk premia peripheral and uncertainty resettled in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the major crisis of European debt. 
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional Government Helennic is imposed by the demands of Brussels by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts. 
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set in his appointment may be short to apply, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new austerity measures in no case and reiterated its demand for new elections for the planned datte of 19 February. 
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive. 
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. 
However, the message of Samaras emerging doubts about his position: "We are committed to help the transitional government, but we have committed to nothing more." 
The conservatif leader has gone a step further in its pulse that EU and IMF must unlock the 8000 million that Athens needs with urgency, and has made it clear that it will not approve any letter of commitment adjustments. 
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the referendum last-minute bargaining chip Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will help if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible." 
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return "very soon" in Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is a final date. 
The Greeks still have much to do. 
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope." 
The Queen highlights the "important role" of Spain in relation to this type of finance 
Spain "has reached a prominent place in the world in the role of Micro Finance." 
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country in the last two decades has become the second donor in the world in relation to this instrument of cooperation that "gasoline" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being." 
The Queen opened yesterday the V- e World Summit of Micro-credit Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and "very specifically, reducing half the volume of people who live with incomes below a dollar a day, which is set the" poverty line ." 
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with" responsibility, "said Queen Sofía, who had hoped that the initiatives and origins during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poor and especially for women, " the main beneficiaries of these loans. 
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges." 
The Micro-credit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which it takes "two basic goals." 
For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of the poverty line in which they live now. 
The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the trail initiated a few years in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed the Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition." 
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," which it has since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to see on the ground its lending policy. 
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I saw a continuing evolution," said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term "head of family" meeting at Valladolid on the part of the "deep pocket of the poor." 
Finally, the Queen Sofía ended his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty. 
"Ethic imperative" 
The External Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an essential ethic" for any democratic state. 
In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation." 
Jiménez considered that micro-credits require "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow that it is the victim of cutbacks. 
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development." 
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "confidence" to the people "excluded all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the participants to the people in a city that opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity. " 
The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage 
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor, but also president of the Christian Democratic Party. 
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme but has imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider government policy too lax Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow. 
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously. 
1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained. 
The standing ovation of several minutes were right, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Finance Minister, left no room for doubt. 
The idea - the Chancellor - and the motion - is a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe." 
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro." 
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to a breakthrough in Europe." 
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the fiscal policies of the countries of the eurozone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe." 
This is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. 
Of course, it is unlikely that the EU27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile, and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy. 
But the milestone is raised. 
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which of course meant to strengthen the weight of Germany. 
Anxious to appease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win its congress on the backs of the "smaller" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany. 
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France. 
Except in hollow. 
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle. 
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeat of Napoleon's army. 
What is the fraud judgments disease? 
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments disease. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and give a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against fraud and handouts. 
And to accompany this offensive, a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralded an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sickness rates. 
First budget savings: the government plans to impose on employees of private a fourth day of waiting before taking charge of a work stoppage. 
Clearly, without any specific agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, at least 15% of its monthly income. 
A measure that threatens to spark anger, but which would yield EUR 280 million, according to The UK. 
And who would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic significance: impose officials a day of uncompensated work stoppage (they have so far not waiting period from three days in the private). 
While these issues are under discussion, the majority relaunch the issue of fraud, targeting this time abuses linked to the work stoppages. 
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you repay," said Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday 13 November. 
As in other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to the work stoppages. 
This is indeed the subject since 2002 to constant monitoring and offensive policies, which are most often paid off. 
The French no more ill than elsewhere in Europe. 
We first focus on the national figures. 
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than 237 million euros per diem were issued in 2006. 
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in economics of health, daily allowances accounted for in 2008 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros. 
On this amount, 46% were maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were sickness rates, or 6.2 billion euros. 
And therefore 2.5% of health spending. 
In 2010, the French have experienced an average 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting. 
An average conceals some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day to stop disease. 
Another study, this time of medicare, states that in 2010, 37% of sickness rates were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% from one to three months and 11% above. 
When compared with their European neighbours, employees are no more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages. 
A lengthy study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for reasons of health or not), in France, between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. 
Fraud judgments disease represents very little undeclared work. 
With regard to fraud, it reached only a small scale. 
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 that the controls are systematic on sickness rates of more than 45 days. 
In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the NHIF found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term judgments were "unjustified or too long," or 37,050 cases. 
In the case of the judgments of more than 45 days, systematically monitored, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate or unwarranted" about 1.2 million, or 132,000. 
In total, 169,000 cases "unjustified," over several million workers who have been stopping disease. 
A figure that represents very little, for example, that of undeclared work. 
According to the UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of loss of tax revenue per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud in the past. 
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan 
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to redress its economy. 
This is what said Monday 14 November the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, before the European Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to its unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task. 
"To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment," said the head of the government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday. 
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added. 
As a result, Mr. Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced to around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. 
The right to refuse new austerity measures 
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, has given Monday its support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not be an additional austerity. 
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy. 
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery. 
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has warned that the IMF and the EU does not débloqueraient the loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would sign nothing under external pressure. 
We need to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts 
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada 
In the area of palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer. 
Society lives in denial of death. 
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to this effect. 
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report from the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine. 
The Committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is required, with a patient deemed competent to take such a decision. 
First-off, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. 
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death." 
Or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada. 
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital. 
Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital. 
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it will change the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide. 
However, according to the experts, who have also gone through all the countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this leads to decriminalization of abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not willing. 
On the contrary, stated yesterday by teleconference Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, would be more cases of these excesses specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised. 
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal." 
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie. 
Canadians in favour of euthanasia 
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010. 
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled has less value. 
As for people who have assisted suicide, asked to 41% that they should not be prosecuted. 
In terms of maintaining or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. 
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not criminal. 
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals are trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution. 
In the area of palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer. 
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce the physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures. 
Reservations from other experts 
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada. 
Pierre Deschamps, an expert in health law, called "extreme" the position of experts signatories of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. 
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who would have more than 18 years could ask for help to commit suicide," said Ms. Fields, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report. 
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to put the autonomy of the person above all other values that contribute to the social fabric of society. 
"In society, he said, there are limitations and constraints." 
The law expert Margaret Somerville has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "manifest pro-euthanasie." 
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenged the data in the report about the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised in the Netherlands and Oregon. 
The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave 
Damascus denounced a "conspiracy" 
Syria is increasingly isolated 
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday in the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, and denounced a "conspiracy" against the country. 
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, bordering Syria, have taken a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad. 
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed. 
"If Bashar had to heart the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC. 
For its part, the head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in a failure. 
"Those who are not in the Middle East peace with their people and cannot satisfy the will," he said, referring to Syria, another country with which Turkey has adopted an increasingly hard line. 
The US has welcomed a " strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union. 
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department. 
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime perished in the region of Deraa in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH). 
Two other civilians have died in exchanges of gunfire and shelling with heavy machine guns at Jobar " in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO. 
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid imprisonment has estimated that the country is "heading towards the end of the crisis." 
He has strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its work, which is "a very dangerous step." 
Syria "does not waver," he added, assuring that "the ourdis conspiracies against Syria will fail." 
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism to protect civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country. 
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favored the sending of observers from the UN to help protect civilians of the repression of the regime that he locks himself in the "paranoia." 
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities plagued by the dispute and the release of demonstrators arrested. 
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus. 
Italy 
Monti markets and sacrifices to the Italians 
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time for the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices," in order to recover the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government. 
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the trade unions and employers. 
It should put in place a firm relatively composed of technocrats from outside Parliament. 
"Monti has spoken of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco the member of one of the many small groups engaged in the talks, after having met with the President of the Council appointed. 
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part said expect that Mario Monti sought by Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support. 
The consultations will be completed by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a restricted list, perhaps a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano. 
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them time. 
"Democracy, there are timelines" to prepare a government and its agenda, he stressed, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and understand." 
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September. 
The prime minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he wants to include "policies." 
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he said. 
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of Parliament by Friday. 
Mr. Monti pledged, once in office, to work in the emergency and in order that Italy "protagonist" in Europe. 
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change." 
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for new austerity measures. 
The "boss of bosses" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who will be on Tuesday, has also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit." 
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as a European commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme," the "teacher" symbolizing "the serious challenge" and "other Italy," according to the editorialists. 
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team. 
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections because Italy must place by April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds. 
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program 
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said Monday, an American NGO specialising in nuclear risk. 
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Atomic Security (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher. 
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program. 
According to ISIS largely from documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center at Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion. 
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano diamonds" in Kiev. 
The economic difficulties of his company would have led to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995. 
He would then cooperated in the Iranian programme in 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia. 
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme in his country of origin." 
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences have increased by 50% 
The crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other religious and racial violence have declined slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday. 
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, against an increase of 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offences against Jews and an increase of 14% of crimes and offences anti-religious. 
The total number of "hate crimes" rose marginally to 6,628 cases, 47.3% motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI. 
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in antimusulmanes violence is particularly significant," said in a statement. 
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," said one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre. 
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he said, arguing that it could pass through improved police reports on "hate crimes." 
The "hate crime" in the US federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights. 
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, colour, religion, origin and now sex. 
Twitter is changing its platform and is more akin to Facebook 
The site of micro blogging Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which is like a little more than Facebook. 
A new "activity" and another "name" to follow more legibly, direct the activity of other "Twittos," which follows the messages ("tweets") and those who will follow. 
This allows us to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc. 
This new form of Twitter has been tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being distributed to the entire network Monday, told the AFP spokesman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner. 
Twitter, which was known for its functioning little instinctive, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend another user) happiness insiders, opens to a wider audience with a more comparable to those of mainstream networks Facebook and Google +. 
On the network, users discussed "tweets" decided on the value of this innovation. 
"It is unnecessary, intrusive, and it is too similar to Facebook," wrote. 
"Functionality will help me to better follow certain elements of my Twitter stream," was sent. 
Austria 
Registration of a fiscal "golden rule" in the constitution 
The government of Social Democrat/Christian Democrat ruling coalition in Austria decided Tuesday to enshrine in the constitution a fiscal "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration in the credit rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A). 
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. 
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered one notch from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest every year," argued Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. 
Austria following a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the eurozone on 26 October: the heads of state and government had called for the registration by the end of 2012 for the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value. 
The system adopted by the Austrian government is moving closer to the "German model," Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule." 
By 2017, the public deficit will decrease each year from 0.75% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the public deficit of the federal state should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets. 
The goal is to move to 2020/21 public debt below the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty. 
Strong yen 
Noda threat of a new intervention in the foreign exchange market 
The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would once again on the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise. 
"We will act as we have done the last time if we see an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, " said Mr. Noda in the Senate. 
On Tuesday, the yen was near historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October. 
That day, Tokyo has massively sold yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record since 1945 against the greenback. 
But the yen has steadily risen since then, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe. 
The dollar rose Tuesday in 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen, near levels that have triggered the latest intervention. 
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen. 
The outbreak of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it says the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency. 
"Japan struggle to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the region in the Tohoku (northeast), said Mr. Noda who fear that the rise of the yen does not kill in the bud the fragile recovery. 
The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter of 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption leaded by the disaster. 
But the Prime Minister has ruled that the high yen does not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan." 
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its board of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. 
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken "appropriate measures," suggesting that no monetary flexibility was to wait until Wednesday. 
At its last meeting in late October, the Institute of emissions increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasuries, increasing to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling amounts that it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity. 
Euro area: 
Rates are rising, the stock markets flanchent 
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices. 
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue their ascent. 
Always worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock markets moved a little more into negative territory, Tuesday 15 November. 
In Paris, at 10: 00am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points. 
The DAX in Frankfurt yielding 0.4% and 0.1%. 
"With the new tensions on the bond yields in the euro zone states in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains." 
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional dealer at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters. 
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, with renewed fears of market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis. 
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a corridor of narrow fluctuations that investors will not evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. 
This renewed concerns about the future of the euro penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday. 
The euro is changing at its lowest level in a month and a half. 
At 10am, the European currency is worth 1,3570 dollar, declining 0.4%. 
According to brokers, it has fallen after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU congress Monday, has adopted a motion that includes the possibility for a country struggling to get out of the eurozone without leaving the European Union. 
The Spanish and Italian rates far beyond 6% 
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels. 
Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, Spanish debt maturity 6.2%. 
These tensions on interest rates in the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders. 
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by the weight of its debt. 
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government. 
Spain is in the frontline of the markets, while Sunday's legislative elections in the country. 
The difference in rates ("spread") between the bonds to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new high history. 
In anticipation of the growth figures for the eurozone 
Statistics, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected by household consumption. 
INSEE, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of a stagnation. 
And, it is truly the fourth that worries most economists. 
Germany, for its part, has grown by 0.5% over the same period. 
A first estimate for the whole of the eurozone is expected at 11am, while the European Commission has warned against the risk of a new recession. 
Energy policy: 
The facts must outweigh the dogmas 
If there is an issue that we cannot treat from short-term considerations or emotion, it is the energy policy. 
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. 
It is healthy that a rendezvous is the opportunity to reflect on such issues and nuclear power. 
The debate will be successful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. 
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data. 
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic changes will result in a doubling of electricity by 2050, unless depriving a huge part of the world population of a vital element. 
At the same time, it will be necessary to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the environmental debate. 
The accident in Fukushima does none of these parameters. 
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. 
This is the case of Belgium, which makes her the need to be able to find an alternative source able to substitute or Switzerland, which is just not built that last generation plants. 
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, are pursuing their projects with determination. 
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. 
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech. 
The choice of Berlin will translate into a rise in the price of electricity, energy dependence aggravated by the increasing reliance on imported gas, particularly from Russia, a surge of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas-fired power plants and coal. 
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt. 
The case of Denmark is to ponder. 
European champion of the wind, which derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind; its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average. 
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an invoice 40% more electricity to French households. 
While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies have the cheapest electricity in Europe. 
Thus, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make false declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power. 
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially given that they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show. 
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has helped to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs. 
A strong exporter, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs on international markets and makes them very job-creating non-transferable. 
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as shrinking 6 billion euros of French exports nuclear equipment and services. 
What would a PRT designed to operate 60 years ago when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed? 
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of production d " miracle power, nor that there is evil. 
The development by Areva of low emitters of CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions, illustrates the complementarity of sources of energy. 
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative. 
We have a security authority in France that has a transparent and strict control over the existing plants on the site of Flamanville site. 
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession. 
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents. 
One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences. 
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and human unforgivable mistakes have caused the tragedy. 
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. 
The nuclear industry will draw the lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two. 
Result of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and the French and German manufacturers, the PRT has a design making it able to resist such phenomena. 
While it is regarded by all electricians who want to build a power station, halting its construction to Flamanville site would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF leaving them free to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power. 
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan tactics dominate a debate as crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country. 
Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy? 
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed "country of human rights" of France. 
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talent, builders and restaurant servers." 
But it is only rarely analysed in economic terms. 
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right. 
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and left by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990. 
The only difference, the degree of generosity 
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right. 
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and the French company. 
The only difference is the degree of generosity that daignera towards immigrants. 
In his programme, François Hollande confined to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem." 
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem may be electorally profitable, but it is economically very expensive. 
As the recall economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (of People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. 
Restricting immigration anemic growth and damaging employment. 
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can substitute for domestic workers, especially low-skilled, to exert downward pressure on their wages. 
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers, most of the trades in sectors lack of employment. 
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training is not the supply of jobs. 
A positive effect on wages 
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country that is experiencing a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment. 
Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term. 
Without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized American Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). 
Migrants are also contributors of social systems, on average 1% of the total budget in European countries. 
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) from 150,000 to public budgets on average over the whole of his life. 
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, pick up the missing points of growth "with teeth." 
The teeth used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. 
Europe has invented democracy, is to think European democracy 
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a very fragile. 
The European continent should be remembered for having invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has seen throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. 
Some were able to believe that it would be enough to ensure that democracy triomphât definitively from its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the most direct way. 
We know, since Napoleon "Petit," that it was an ease of thought. 
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be "instrument of oppression" as once the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. 
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice. 
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and start a crisis of politics and democracy. 
The palinodie of the vrai-faux Greek referendum will be held in this regard revealing double value: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also the disturbing sense of impossibility, for its incongruity. 
This ambivalence must be thought to be outdated. 
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today were displaced, and that, for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction. 
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, held as necessities and disorganised. 
A blank cheque to the European absolute monarch or a leap to feet in the vacuum of the nationalist downturn: what choice for the citizen! 
No, we do not want cleavers but an exercise, right, calm and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level. 
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we cannot stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe. 
It is Europe as a whole conform to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity. 
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage. 
It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations. 
The urgency is to restore the popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project. 
Because it is that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing. 
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster. 
Having long fought this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is calling for the European economic government. 
Either. 
But the thinking without a stronger democratic and political integration, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse. 
We need to take a new stage of European construction. 
For the Republic in France, it took "to" Republicans. 
The Revolution in interest could not be enough. 
This lesson remains valid. 
We must build a Europe more integrated economically. 
This can be done only by building a more democratic Europe on the political front, a genuine European popular sovereignty. 
In Europe, are Europeans. 
Smart cards "without contact" spreading 
The World Fair smartcard opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate. 
The year 2011 should be completed on an increase of 11% of global sales of smart cards (bank card, phone SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm. 
The most promising segment is the contactless technology that makes it possible to pay transit or to settle its purchases by simply approaching the map of a reader. 
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, from 320 million a year earlier. 
Their share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card ($6.925 million cards). 
Long lagging behind in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for payment without contact. 
Some 26 million bank Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept. 
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed. 
But mass merchandisers make strides. 
Carrefour issued this year and 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact. 
To move to a higher level, it is now that banks on their clients. 
"Two big French pledged to disseminate future systematically to their customers cards equipped to contact," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France. 
Banks test payment by mobile 
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone. 
Few devices are now equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out transactions. 
"They have fallen behind." 
"But they should finally see a real boom next year." 
"We rely on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. 
But the banks are taking the lead. 
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June at Caen. 
The iPhone of some 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a holster authorizing the payment without contact. 
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. 
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the marketing of an offer to allow its customers to pay without contact with their mobile. 
Western Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends 
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram. 
Long suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed. 
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty." 
"The way in which the two organisations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he said without more detail. 
Paris seems to make a similar analysis. 
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered bridges. 
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation launched by the French special forces. 
In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators were to return several telephone chips belonging to terrorists. 
Terrorist axis 
The analysis of the calls directed towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. 
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigérien who has travelled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sect. 
"It is a step forward, but we should probably expect more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram." 
"But it is possible." 
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys financial support and foreign intellectuals and that it is increasingly active," probably Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. 
In recent months these "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its methods, which include the use of suicide bombers or explosives increasingly complex and even bill than those used by Aqmi. 
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore lobbied Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. 
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated little interest. 
A rapid success 
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means haoussa "Western education is a sin" - calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. 
In this poor region, the association is undergoing a rapid success. 
It is politicizing and requires a strict observance of Sharia law while its militants committed the fight against the central government impious. 
These are first churches, bars, administrations. 
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations. 
The Abuja reaction is, as usual, without nuances. 
The army is the city, there are 800 deaths. 
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison. 
So the sect will be radicalized and leave its northern fiefdoms. 
Last Christmas, it claims an attack that 80 people were killed in Jos, then another in Abuja. 
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram takes the secure headquarters of the police during an attack suicide, his first. 
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target. 
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that is operating from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria worried now all security specialists. 
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent. 
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and is willing to share all the information." 
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency 
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry vie for superficiality and ignorance. 
America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas? 
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe. 
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other increasingly loud statements and shortcuts in matters of foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point. 
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - mounts. 
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party," has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and "for manipulation of their currency," a promising theme in an America fueled by the migration of large swathes of its industry to Asia. 
No wonder if this must involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said. 
Jon Huntsman, the former China Obama and only candidate to have a vision of foreign policy sophisticated, almost strangle an attitude that "suits" emotions. 
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). 
But Huntsman, who remains in the depths of the polls, is inaudible. 
The image of Reagan 
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program. 
"If I am elected, I will leave Iran, he fanfaronné." 
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb." 
He has also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to the partner. 
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best candidate, has an embarrassing lack of records. 
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964. 
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against the drug cartels. 
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. 
It is far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. 
Opponents of the current president argued that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he has won the Cold War. 
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of counterterrorism. 
They rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the over-hasty departure "boys" in Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, hugging a small label. 
But the attack is not so easy. 
The population sees positive stock of Obama's national security, which has eliminated Bin Laden. 
In Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to the stalemate. 
And, on the grounds that there is a need to economically rebuild America to revive its leadership, Obama strikes fairer. 
The Nord Stream, new ntrée of Russian gas in Europe 
The Nord Stream gas pipeline directly linking Western Europe to Russia at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service. 
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households. 
Gazprom, the giant Russian gas, has sought to celebrate the event. 
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government participated, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline linking directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany. 
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister of France François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valve commander of Russian gas in the European-Western network. 
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 kilometers linking the St Petersburg region in the Land of Mecklenburg. 
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of the entire French consumption. 
And mention the possibility of building a third on the same route. 
For Gazprom, the completion of this huge project victory. 
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries. 
The Nord Stream will indeed be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine). 
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets. 
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939. 
That is to say if the issue is politically sensitive. 
Western Europe, with its support for the Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies. 
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between East and West Europeans. 
Russia has been able, in five years ago, making his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline. 
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon launching this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are also political and economic. 
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, in numbers to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of gas. 
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat. 
The submarine tube is steel gainé concrete in order to protect against ship anchors. 
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average. 
To build, it was necessary to avoid mines from the Second World War. 
"One hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. 
It has also taken more measures to protect flora and fauna. 
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: neither valve, nor station maintenance. 
A monitoring platform was planned off Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the Swedes were reluctant to see a society of Russian state permanently off their coasts. 
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," said Jens Müller. 
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air. 
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned welds for a leak every 100,000 years. 
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline. 
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced in the tube, a metre in diameter, and it is driven by the gas. 
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information on the possible distortions of the metal. 
The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without having to undergo the slightest repair. 
The flow of gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure. 
It is 200 bars at the outset, and 100 on arrival. 
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project. 
The leader is Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares. 
Joined the German E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez (9% each). 
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline. 
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable. 
Gazprom was then leased to the company for 20 years, the entire gas transport capacity. 
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," said Jens Müller. 
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans. 
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes. 
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million. 
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. 
The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine. 
Valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas. 
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and characteristics of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German pipelines. 
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes. 
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million. 
Moleskine, a brand notebook. 
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing. 
He has a whiff of adventures, hours to write in the light of a candle. 
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular coverage, its elastic, leaves a white broken, as dated by the time. 
However, the book Moleskine as we know today was born... in 1997. 
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design but distinguished notes. 
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product. 
The book is based on an old technique of production, the mole skin (skin), which refers to a cotton varnish used to cover seats for example. 
This type of book was very popular among writers and travellers. 
"Moleskine has given buzz-words an old and forgotten, who was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, now the head of the mark in Modo Modo. 
The success is there. 
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins. 
It is far from the confidential production of the early years, where only 3,000 books were designed. 
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States. 
Difficult to establish a profile of the buyer, because the rating attracts both the businessman that students and professionals. 
The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated. 
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York. 
It distributes its books in bookstores, the FNACs small shops in downtown and was able to impose its identity. 
"We have followed the air time and this new writing, despite the rise of Email," said Maria Sebregondi. 
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists put their own book. 
In August, it has also launched a leopard coverage at the Festival of the Locarno film. 
Taking advantage of its success and cultural Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer bags... the mark is on a range of formats. 
A success that has made envious: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. 
Why the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities remain so high? 
About 19% of people with disabilities are in search of a job. 
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today. 
Despite a proactive policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole of the population. 
Discouraging? 
"No, says Eric Jacques-Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people." 
"The progress made over the past 15 years are considerable." 
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher." 
"There is still a lot to do." 
It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, the obstacles remain before access to employment. 
They are older: 37% more than 50 years (17% on average). 
They have a low level of qualification: 80% did not and 2.3 million students in higher education, 10,000 are disabled. 
Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average. 
In short, as many criteria more complicated the return to employment, and who "are the crux of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit disabled workers. 
This is the brakes. 
It remains unspoken, attitudes are changing, of course, but too slowly. 
A study conducted in April by the IMS association - Initiate Precinct indicated that managers interviewed "a low level of knowledge of disability," with a "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities." 
The result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987. 
The latest figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%. 
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre White, Director General of AGEFIPH's, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with the law. 
The evidence: the number of establishments "taxed," just as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros). 
"The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc. 
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups." 
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees. 
Hazard: "Happiness" 
Before facing the Azzurri on Tuesday evening (8.45pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure afforded this match. 
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic. 
Sitting side by side on the podium in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace. 
Five months after the mood gesture of his attack against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has only praise. 
"I am very happy to Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian." 
"I want to move forward," says Lillois. 
As for the contrastre between his club benefits and selection, "it's a whole, has justified." 
"In Lille, I am the entire year, which is not the case with Belgium." 
"It is important that I take my brands." 
Against Romania Friday night for the game against France, Hazard comes at Saint-Denis to finally "shine." 
Without forgetting, however, the notion of "fun." 
The Blues, he has promoted since the age of 7 years and victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000. 
"I have always been bear," he said. 
Inevitably, this helps to strengthen the "special character" of this meeting. 
Even in the face, "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil Rami)," said he. 
"It was earlier." 
"Being able to play against them, it is only happiness!" 
With bonhomie, Leekens has spoken of "pride." 
"Pride" contest "a gala match." 
"Pride" - as a "neighbour" - that France is "now a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. 
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he enthused. 
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would share the plane with the Blues... Brazil in 2014. 
"Our small Belgians are great," he said. 
"We are in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry." 
"You are going to report in the coming matches." against France. 
Portugal very confident 
Portugal Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimistic his return to Bosnia (10pm), Tuesday in Lisbon. 
The move, the two teams had lacked realism. 
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country." 
Paulo Bento, in Poland and Ukraine. 
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which is the joysticks since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012. 
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness. 
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to counter. 
In view of the game to go (0 - 0) Friday in the hell of Zenica, it is clear that the games are not made. 
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved. 
"It is a good result, which entails a certain risk because we have not marked" 
But at home, in their luminous Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience that should be here too, even if the party is obviously "very tight," as a lucid but optimistic Bento. 
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that they can take the upper hand," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years. 
"We continue to have 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012," has put the successor to Carlos Queiroz. 
No one reported Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win. 
It may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark. 
"It is a good result, which entails a certain risk because we have not left outside," Bento regrets. 
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added. 
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to reflect." 
A good idea to be realistic, this time.
