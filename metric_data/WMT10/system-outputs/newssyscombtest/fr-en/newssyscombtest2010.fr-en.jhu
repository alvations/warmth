The lack of snow in mountain concern the hotel
The trails deserted pose no problem to operators of lifts.
The lack of snow puts people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
Of this, it is still possible to find rooms free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
The Internet travel offers, asking prices but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of Spindl.info. information portal
If we want to spend New Year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better is no longer hesitate to book.
If the priority is given to economies and that the quality of accommodation only then, we can try to wait a few more days.
The Špindler hotel offer for the moment that stays of one week for the new year.
I think that they will try again a moment of the place, but they Cèderont them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will quickly, "said Jandura.
The tourism Ingtours Agency of Vrchlabí also proposes free beds for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we are most concerned for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the houses in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few last minute Christmas stays cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agency of Vrchlabí can also propose new year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
The first fourteen days of February go well, the remaining winter trips sell moderately.
This year, interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
The people expect that it will start to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter to the mountain without snow.
If the trails cover during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
In contrast, the occupation of the hotel Horizont CI pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five percent.
We still last few places for the new year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of January of Poles and February is also selling well, "inform Karel Rada, Director of best hotel CI.
The Omnia Hotel near the parking central Jánské Lázně is also full to eighty percent during the new year period.
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent Jánské hotel Lázně.
This year, we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of occupation at the moment.
February is a little more low at the moment, but as soon as snow will fall, the interest for the Krkonoše still enlarging certainly indicated the Director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel Krkonoše must not however hope more snow.
Thursday it will more costs and if there are precipitation, they should be snowy mountain.
But by the time should be warm, inform Jiří Jakubský of Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: repetition is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comic, conscientious effort with which Barack Obama, President to the reputation of wise, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, he considered himself very simple.
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it emerged that he had Recopied carbon paper since the Iraq scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression "as in Iraq", he has not hesitated, that is, to use the title of the January 2007 speech by Bush as the title of his own speech: "a new road before"
At the same time, he has personally criticised the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following months have however shown that Bush ’ s strategy, which stemmed from recommendations of the campaigns commanders, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers at the moment do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the Bush reputation, objectively speaking, it has left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might hope.
Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
They are again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase of military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley Mccristal, who has severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better alternative, at least it has defrauded the general 10 000 soldiers.
He has managed to extricate the promise of additional 5 000 from the Europe, even if there were over 10 000.
This causes the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw military forces from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process by three years. The doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
In spite of fratricidal wars in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based formally remain that the smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex balancing the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act ', which is the aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy makes perplexed by his proactive.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the clamour of war in view of their "quick return to the home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, fix a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will see us as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
The European political or do not want to explain to their electorate in what the security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions do not have effects on the Iranians, the Americans find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It must be addressed by example when, according to Obama, America will the victorious withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will however a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, if it proves to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive more than premiums in cash
The top leaders of the American bank Goldman Sachs employees will receive this year of cash premiums.
The company announced to respond to strong criticism about its practices.

According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs arises and in leading the effort to link the rewards with long-term performance to Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning that we need to take, "said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after set aside almost $17 billion to premiums on the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion in despite the announcement today, according to the Reuters news agency.

The Minister Janota intends to resign. Klaus has invited to Château
The President Václav Klaus will Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it was adopted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota to Cabinet will be on the agenda of their appointment on Friday.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, widening the public finance crisis.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat has informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss its service Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be subject to the signing of Klaus, it is a deficit of crowns 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left about transfers of money and has increased the rewards of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused proposals of the Social Democrats that they would increase the budget deficit in an indirect way.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer who had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the Čssd and the Green Party.
The critics claim that the budget, as it has been voted by the members, abolishes the package of savings measures by the Government from Fischer and who must according to stem the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who may ratify the Law on the State budget but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "disability Irréfrénable" of public finances.
At present there is, according to him, no positive solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if it could rely on a broad consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should question its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the Čtk that the idea of a Cabinet administrative supported by the Čssd, ODS and Greens works clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of 'verdicts drastic ".
The head of Čssd Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Wednesday, Čssd described success already the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
In spite of criticism of the fact that the key roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus - unbeaten will explain to the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
American Morgan Freeman, actor by Academy Award, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black President.
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela Ninety-one years who asked him to the embodiment in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him, 'If I have you embody, I should be able to see you personally..
The actor seventy-two years old who was awarded a prize for his role in the Clint Eastwood's drama soils dollar baby located in the middle of the boxing has, for example, the leader of a movement against slavery became slave, himself a President of the USA shadow, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important to so many people as Mandela.
The Ex-homme of State South African was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The most important thing for him was to shake her hand.
I realized that when I give you my hand, I recovered energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang to the door of the House, I opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I have the air much greater in the film ".

The mystery of the will in Norway is determined: the Russians Cruzi a rocket
There has been a luminous phenomenon strange of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has acknowledged that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has yet been a failure and the type "Bulava missile" which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its presence repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava has not disappeared, or it is damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as "missile that not flying"
A missile not flying but conspicuous
Normally this 13th test took place at the beginning.
It is only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a vessel movement and underwater
This is why the mysterious light above the Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the has likely been a Bulava "flawed.
The rest, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and damage has only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed on the first floor.
Although none of test launches has happened smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of nearly 50 percent so fills the general optimism and they claim that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and prevail even ten nuclei hypersonic a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov training and agreement to help the team.
We still must resolve some details on the form, says coach of club Sergey Nyemtchinov, cited by the Agency PA.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and supersedes all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent trade unions have declared a state of emergency Monday strike.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of plant Hyundai has confirmed.
However, the management agreement yet with the trade unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, and that is why that voluntary overtime have been proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company proposed a bonus 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded also checking for the day worked on 28 November.
The firm, Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
They either receive the supplement for hours in addition, they can ask a replacement leave December 28 and extend their end of year holidays Aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that the overtime were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and the demands of the unions as employees who have quit spontaneously the production last week, management has decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two overtime of their eight hours.
The unions have cancel the state of strike after the signature of the agreement.
The following bargaining between the direction of the automotive plant and the unions should take place Friday afternoon.
The Labour leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were prepared to stop the state of strike in cases of agreement on their claims and signing of a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees started spontaneously in strike due to overtime incessant.
They are protesting against the poor conditions of pay and so-called Bizutages.
The Directorate has defended with the fact that employees should work supplement to meet the imperatives of car production.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, the trade unions have also requested that employees who ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year an honorarium of 5 000 DKK (209 €) for them.
The automotive plant Hyundai Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200 cars per year.
Discovery Czech: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "robust" also
A team of scientists Czechs and Germans to test new combinations which can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the substance improved is that it is also on the viruses which have already developed an immunity to medicines.
This reality is, in some cases, over the fact that the combination is not as intensely on common variation of virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure the AIDS at the moment.
We can, however, extend the life of patients through a mixture of drugs to prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, their use causes a series of side effects.
Of more repression of this proliferation has the effect development of what are known as resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have effect.
The work of the experts of the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances known Metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way to all drugs used until now and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes into the protein of the virus.
The Metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, will be also the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their works published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short link organic, which is then modified.
A somewhat smaller, but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV protease was tested in tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of Metalocarboranes is not as strong as on drugs clinical, however it is not diminishing on versions resistant against which current medications are often ineffective.
The Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as chemical and biological stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore of interesting food combinations to examine more towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is to Fischer, who defends
The President of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister has described the ODS of verdict.
He said take time to analyse.
The spokesperson of the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of a Cabinet administrative supported by the Čssd, ODS and the Green Party working more.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether Ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies on the minority who are concerned with combating the growing deficit, or is of concern to remain in its parliamentary functions with the aid of the left.
Nečas warns that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, however, with amendments to tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's plea to proposals from the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as a revised budget is a variant less bad than a budget of acting.
Disappointment and useful
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave its duties in the event of ratification of amendments, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota took meeting Monday with the Prime Minister after its passage Government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas estimates that the representatives of Čssd, which have imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratify other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Act on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in issue.
This is the head of Government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing detrimental, Topolánek said in a release text from the United States.
He recalled that the Deputy of some departments are calling top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give its resignation to fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House."
This said, it must not expect to support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought and once it will be on the agenda then I will dedicate, said since the Chamber to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to government by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The ODS was reversed at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the Democratic members to allow the budget vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered accusations from the President of the party in the House or in the country in negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would is lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.

The Czech Railways going to remove or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and will on the contrary others.
Complete coverage of the transport fall at the day of entry into force of the new schedule of two percent compared to today.
Most of the tariffs will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced fare.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who have more connections to the capital, the railways will add a string Pendolino.

There will also be fewer trains on the Prague - Písek line - české Budějovice hotline, Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the greater decline in transport is the Hradec Králové region of eight percent in total, Prague, and its environs can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - české Budějovice line are also cancelled and the movement of few express trains on the Prague - Písek line - české Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes, we can see the introduction of a new Milovice hotline in Prague: for the time the people of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the commuter system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination to the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní Nádraží).
The Čd will introduce more HC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk / 20-21 leave for two hours.
The travellers can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: additional SEK 200 million.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transport and the railways will next year in all four billion kronor to visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are controlled by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in up to almost three billion.
This year the Regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year.
The railways like the system, which also explained that they have not resorted to a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes affect only tickets a day Čd net notes and Internet at reduced prices Eliška.
For travellers without reduction card, the price of Čd net increase of 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of Eliška will newly depend on the Loh, then that there was valid between cities in a region to choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.

The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood happens in the US in the next few days, the title is Invictus (official title Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), and Narrae a part of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid is income to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen it years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of legendary champion South of rugby was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theatres, the critical and public returns are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Of his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.

He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is full preparations for the football World Cup, and secondly because the media are disturbed by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of people from the black majority in power.

I also often personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover from its energy, he indicated in the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that is a good thing if you have the possibility to remind via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it is each individual he added.
Wear the jerseys of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin's novel The title being freely translated. in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play which has given the South African people depicts the defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film and pick two racial groups of a population long divided and Nelson Mandela in 1995 he between wearing the shirt African national team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been a lengthy ovation it fourteen years ago mainly white audience and was recognized by the white populations.
Hope that the football championship will manage to unite people in a single nation, "said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only" black "in 1995 of the national team.
It remains to be seen if the situation African tense will improve.
The white South Africans are sceptical, however as recently said in an interview for ln Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The Championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jančura will bring proceedings for defamation against three prefects of Čssd
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today complaint for slander against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the region of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura has indicated in Dvacet UNMIT Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
Ultimately, however, all regions have sign long-term contracts with the railways Czech.
All three have attacked us and say that is the fine mouths, while there has only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways that were signed last week.
Therefore we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange of vilification on the Society Student Agency, said Jančura Radiožurnál.
As well, he indicated that he had evidence that no region was conducted in agreement with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Mr Hašek considers that the filing of complaint Jančura represents the following its media spectacle which acts of free publicity for his company and his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura handling public opinion and utilises arguments false and deceptive about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed the last week that it will invest several million kronor in an advertisement that indicate the steps of regions.
He said at Radiožurnál that it halt the campaign after Christmas and that he will resume after the new year.
He said that the campaign will corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after that regions have agreed to give the Czech railways the exploitation of rail links for an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing an invitation to tender.
According to Jančura, such a way to act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the Čssd.
The only threat was that if you do not stop, we could lose our licences bus.
It is presented as a member of the Čssd, I do not know who he is but I do not say his name, has said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumococcal reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for the families.
The votes are already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
The pharmaceutical Institute already provides for the maximum prices that vaccines will pay health insurance.
The specialists also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
The free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, the children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free against pneumococcal.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we began the vaccine last year or earlier, we will pay the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and the 5th month of the child.
The last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of more young requires four doses.
The experts estimate that every year health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 SEK in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that the unvaccinated children require.
To date the state spending approximately 500 000 crowns per year for the vaccination of children.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the Janota package.
The pneumococcal are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to investigations in hospitals, there has until 28 deaths of children less than 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
From the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded.
The vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on any obligation to vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by the insurance and optional.
For example, the President of the Association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference in which our Association has participated, the experts were not very satisfied that we have a vaccination optional.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to be able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that it must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We consider it absolutely not for the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Specialty Society of paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccination based on the Volontariata its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction of renewals vaccinations "in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said however Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
The vaccination against pneumococcal marks a break as the fact that it is the first vaccination of children which is funded by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release of funds for prevention, they save and on possible future medical care.
The doctors will buy their products themselves
This is however linked to concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some members feared that this would allow insurance "deduct the amounts of the sickness insurance scheme.
Thus, doctors should buy the products and expect the insurance their returns.
According to estimates, individual pediatricians will invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, that is a substantial sum.
It will be far from easy, according Cabrnochová.
Always them and we
The Islam can be French?
The pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, the author's latest book fan, "why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen ’ s latest book is a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes provide now in France, Quem. Bozen calls "spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims of Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or City Hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the tragedies policies which concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are in general agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia which of our days, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believe that the values of Muslims and the secularism of French might be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make compromises historic with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
The Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say 'yes, but not yet. "
The view the world's dark
The Arctic is changing more quickly and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice are melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, shipments and fishing vessels in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the North, the polar bear.
Knows the history and complicated political of the whale, he described the long tradition of Explorers, Arctic that were their evidence in hunting polar bears.
The Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years who had to fight that the point of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous gathered 75 bear at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo is typically a millionth of the adult Released. surface for the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore became green because of algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Indians Inuit Jet-skiers use of Fusilsd' powerful to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most northerly waters of these two nations of the hunting the ice will be longer.
In his new book, "after the ice", alum Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the Arctic and a glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Atmosphéristes nor the oceanographers can tell with accuracy the speed of change.
This is not to try.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the melting of the ice cap.
The cold war submarines were then mapped changes relief Sous-celle-ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes placed on the icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson look the extraordinary world and tiny the system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressure in freezing.
But the bears referred to above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, this may be our turn"
The Marine, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class Angello Robinson, 19 years, has a trip of seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other marine who made the journey of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate Graves cemetery, this day was devoted to welcome of men and women, which were in their places.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we might be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If it was me, I would like someone do the same thing for me, that is why I just trying to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize the commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths across America (Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16 000 cemetery wreaths on the graves of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery Enarkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150 000 to buy and transport.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military died.
Although her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that, this was a way to thank those who were sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitouflée in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers have market between the lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen graves old, dating from the first and second world war, and the Vietnam war, because they are not often visited also that the new graves, organisers have said.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and the couples stood by the hand, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on the graves.
Each Crown round had a dark green colour, with a little bow butterfly red on the top.
Just hung the silence on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the mood of current wars filled the area.
Of individuals without hiding crying, others prayed and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others have commented to see small black and white, information cards inserted in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had led eight hours to collect on the tomb of Marine Sergeant Gunnerydavid Shane Spicer, died in combat in July.
Nobody should ever forget thanks to what we are free... my son has paid for it, she said.
"long after I have disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US national distributor of mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, the services of the Department of Foreign Affairs said American.
The National, which has not yet been identified, working for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The Society works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. interest section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of be "dangerous".
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speech are considered as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers greater, led by Yoani Sánchez, commentator people who often written on how are husband and they are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but the authorities have always been rejected.
The detention of a US citizen may increase the tension between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as release political prisoners and to create more space for the opposition, the US to retaliate.
The mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba of consumer goods, although that is new and desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation which corresponds to a day of salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans want to connect often must provide their name in government.
The access to many Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare American prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society would be permitted -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a report severe on freedoms in Cuba, called" new Castro, even Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often stopped, judgment and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to us, when the two countries begin to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, Pakistani authorities have identified organization supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would disassemble an important network of terrorists who plundering the Internet in search of young men radicalised.
The investigators said they hunted a personality Insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah which invited these men in Pakistan have discovered when one of them has made approving the waves terrorist comments on the Internet video site YouTube.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of a secret service Pakistanis who has been informed of the matter said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far mountains banned northeast become a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered as undercover agents.
This is why they have been rejected, "said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry in the camps to al-Qaeda when they were arrested by law forces in Pakistan.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- underline the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for infiltrate men in the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters of organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analysts, the American recruits potential are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value Propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the Nefa Foundation based in the US, said that terrorist groups must also do more attention, in recent years in the choice of people that they accept the American secret services have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen calling for a "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have walked the streets here Saturday, calling for a more extensive action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Palais des Congrès Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100 000 people, but 25 000 according to police estimates.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has few explosives near a set of government buildings, in downtown.
On a day when little went over the climate discussions sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying there is no planet b "and one in Spanish, saying" the Earth said that it has enough ".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened his eyes on issues facing the country due to the impact of climate change that are already occurring. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great walk -- to get the word out and to launch an appeal to leaders from around the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be business, it is no longer possible to avoid.
The police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who has asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in the discussions on climate, the activists who wore masks and black clothing, have several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen which is surrounded by some departments.
They launched near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed then by "a few large explosions".
Has inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have not managed to heighten awareness of the key authorities such as Su Wei, the representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "in fact, it is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I can't hear what is happening outside".
He observed that the march could seem that adverse or useful perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, 'you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or affect to the freedom of others. "
The results of the tests reveal persistent gaps between the races
The federal report last week on mathematics achievement has made a good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district is still far behind, the report shows that the grade 4 and grade 5 (Cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the two previous years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures show the National Assessment of Educational Progress (evaluation of progress education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both the local and national plans.
The average results of white children Grade 4 (PO1) to Washingtond.c. have increased, over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The success has in fact increased gap between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, only a point, from 245 to 244.
The mean score of White has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough.
The view of a period of six years is not encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (PO1), when the first report NAEP district was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
The last week, some advocates in the district have expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the director of education institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, "said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that defends the equality in education district.
I do not immediately for one or two points, "said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, and Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of test results is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see positive signs and I respect it.
But fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (collèges).
Rhee has said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, for children in classes end of primary and early college that have not incorporated the bases of reading earlier in their school and is behind in their peers.
Every day, the Mathematics curriculum, for kindergarten classes (kindergarten to grade 6 (6th) focuses on the Games and the real-life experiences, such as they have been implemented in the district by former responsible Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions to these students to below the level of the class, said Rhee.
Others were of the view that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
That is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of teaching at the University of California at Berkeley who is studying the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other superintendent of schools, to try to use the middle class white and black.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our neighbourhoods schools so that all families, regardless of where they are from, are confident that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success is the duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with charter schools.
It must obtain about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who has come to an agreement with the union of teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" for a further increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, falls and Blinks when eyes at the white columns, facades of bricks and lawns green.
The parents of Graciela had only able to finish school, Àel Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in grade 8 (4th) the Gettysburg group explored where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super is where I shall study! exclaimed Graciela who wish to study medicine, while the guide led to the entry of building science.
Ya, really? she says pensive, when she was shown the low ratio Professor of Law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visiting children during their voyage of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: the question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question remains largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic migrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also from hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "Hispanic" second generation "on Cinqpoursuit academic secondary school -- a notable success if we consider that both of their parents immigrants, most from Mexico or Central America, came to us without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to future generations that will play an important role in the country's workforce.
The researchers studying wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high targets to their children and find the means to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at University of California, Davis, who has studied the Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network to support these children, kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that has funded the visit of Graciela is a good example.
Known as gear up (shit you), it provides more than $300 million per year to local schools systems to organize preparation programs to the University that begin when students from families of low income are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of secondary.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil obtained agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over the violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract significant oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies are left with participation in only two of the 10 fields auction.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had auction has lost.
Two American companies have won contracts for the fields auction in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
The Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies which open the track, Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum said Iraq oil Forum, a site information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, corroborated by massive bombings coordinated, Tuesday, and the political instability that American troops withdraw have slowed the American oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts.
The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only companies to secure contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have had strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and providing technical advice, are left with empty hands.
The Russian Lukoil and Gazprom were the two major shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more Enchéri on contracts that other companies and is left with significant shareholdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, and a technological power, said Assam Jihad, the Oil Ministry spokesman.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit auction bid which were then compared with the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay for the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda's operations, this week, said Friday U.S. authorities of counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh Al-somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities have said that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, within the border tribal Pakistan's anarchic.
They drove a car White, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was struck, "said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking on the telephone of Miran Shah.
The representatives have stated that the local activists suspect rushed on place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely shredded".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to ascertain the identity of the victims, but the two representatives counter-terrorism Americans have given evidence not specified that Somali was part of deaths.
Somali was described as one of the responsible military of al-Qaeda organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the region Afghanistan-pakistan.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, "said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidance of the leaders of al-Qaida and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali progressed rapidly in the ranks of Al-qaida' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is not known to the general public, but this does not detract the threat it represents for us and our allies, "said the second official representative.
If her death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by the CIA drones has decreased since the summer, about six transactions per month to two, according to the figures given by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group.
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics terrorist groups who have progressed to decrease their vulnerability in killing also ruthlessly informants suspected, says the site.
The UN special envoy in Kabul withdrew
The UN special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted by allegations of corruption extent during the presidential elections supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported this increase but he expressed concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of US troops beginning in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants helping political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign but that he would simply the commitment that he made to his family in March, only move that two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that he was better start looking at my alternate said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo-Swiss recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused, in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but he stated that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- "have undermined the mission because there already had a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of elections".
Eide said that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would give them more confidence on how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed its frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of hiring UN hampered her ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the UN are such that I could not recruit only one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The defense secretary, Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking at a Roomful of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One of the things I am the most weight is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent to the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that target Iran's political and military elite, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a "set of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" people suffer much of these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, administration has joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its Monitoring Agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1st, he indicated that it would resume the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, develop a confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be distant from the attempts to agreement, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not engage with the US.
Frankly, in my view, the stiffening of Iran with some of the proposals of the international community for which they had given their agreement in early October, has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not considered important, in terms of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
The President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before it turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'sanctions'.
In a statement Thursday in New York, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations has criticised what it calls "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and stated that she agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, in order to obtain a long-term satisfactory solution ".
Gates, who was returning to Washington later Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before getting on the plane for the oil rich region of Kurdish Derencontrer those responsible troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
The persisting tensions between the Kurds and Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the sharing of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also want to calm the anxiety of the Kurds on the pending withdrawal. The American authorities have cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you. "
In the China aging, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster of propaganda lecturing, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "one more baby, this is a grave in more".
They have learned the lesson so well that the government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to a single child.
There is no second, says Wang, 31, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the child single in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a population crisis threatening.
According to the UN, the average birth rate has dropped 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, but it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and more explode, 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1% in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in cities rich coastal having a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
The last year, those aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning) has said that the fertile pairs must have babies to 'help to reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a labor shortage in the future ".
Shanghai is on the point of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however – that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden", she said.
A incremental mitigation
Written in the Constitution in 1978, the single China's one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
The couples who contravene this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and of discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers have denounced the abuse of human rights in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the Authority have forced pregnant women a second child to abortion.
In addition, many couples have had recourse to Sex-selective abortions leading to a ratio boys girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population gradually softened their position on the policy of the child single.
In 2004, they provided more of exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already children -- and 2007, they have softened many of their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research), at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central Government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters to encourage families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and slide of prospectus in their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for files of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, still receiving four to five requests per month.
The responsible for Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be approximately 165 000 -- slightly higher to 2009 but lower in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee in the municipality of Caolu Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu archery, 26, have said that they would dearly have two children and that they are legally entitled.
But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western mistakenly see that a single child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we stole the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Of other couples cite psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, human resources manager, said she wanted only a single child because it itself. "We were the centre of the family and used all the world cares."
We do not usually take care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of the other. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation the said bluntly.
For couples working two, middle class, which reduce the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish Pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of the China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this style of life, he says.
Even a child only requires a lot of time with his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "you should change your apartment" -- and planning -- "when your child has only 9 months, you must write his CV to get a place in the best mother tongue."
The most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
The Group of the United Nations has plans for the reduction of emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN -- characterized so far by assignments disorganized and mutual recriminations -- is back under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, "said the remaining obstacles, as he informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with over 100 world leaders arriving in the next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the UN, the text does not say how rich countries would give poor to support the global warming, the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and the emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in the global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, "said John Coequyt, representative Àwashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what the Secretary-General has described Executive on the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, reduce their 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050.
The European Union has also re-launched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or for avoided deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the US representative to the negotiating climate rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder towards China that the Bush administration has been, it two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern regretted also that the text does not enough to ensure that the reductions could be checked by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, he Yafei has said that the US chief negotiator, either lacked "good sense" was "extremely irresponsible" for said earlier in the week that the US would not help financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers, defects are both within the third and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the US will be destroyed on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen leading countries ignore the imperatives scientists to act courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Delegate of Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the major powers fighting to see who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, which is also advise on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure to obtain a Treaty legally requiring, in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the negotiations will at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which meets 43 members, has drafted a proposal Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-metzger, Head of Unit of the European Commission, said that the climate action of small island States has "put political pressure on the political process complete," in part by what they are now unified and they require to emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, then as delegates focused on the fact that they must solve most of the problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement.
The senior level such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy are hoisted their air and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be reviewed during the course of the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people entering and exiting the Palais des Congrès every day -- activists guitar players present shows night fun of countries who according to them, betraying and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- constitutes a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all key ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the global Conservation International.
The lorry arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the Monday syndrome
Has 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle breaks the night for the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train of countries reach 225 km / h, while it Filera Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes in the first commuter train javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and link the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost become commuter cities successful business travel times will be much less long and the passage of the plane and car to train reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of risks to the environment will hamper British high-speed lines.
According to the Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to conduct a feasibility report for the Government, will her paper to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
It will enable her to obtain a detailed map of the itinerary of the next stage for the high speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a "Y" configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line is split into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch to the West Pennines Àmanchester and Scotland and another to the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance said a professional of rail.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a travel an hour currently.
The proposals will train to travel to 400km / h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be constructed in part by part.
The first trains will be forced to drive out of the high speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best aircraft to ensure passage of trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of rail.
The taxpayers repay the loan of £75,000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the Tory Member of Parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to pay for the cost of a Orangerie that he has built in his home constituency.
The party which has been demoted by David Cameron to be complained that members of Parliament were "nurtured", has increased its loan of £75,000 to construct an extension in oak to its second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at this time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who has a control of expenditure. last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or more simple".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland constituency - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and a dining room, but the office of emoluments says that Mr. Duncan need more space.
The last year, he added a porch to the House, outlining its plans as an orange.
The neighbours describe as a "porch for the pleasure".
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the of the Commons standards and privileges committee, on its loans.
The Committee has cleared the last month of any accusation of non-compliance with rules, after an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of the loan 271.406 GBP of the London property to the house in her constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a Member of Parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 per month of interests to loan until March last year.
In April, its applications have increased by over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan was not changed on this point, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the borrowing of £75,000.
The standard interest rate variable RBS is 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position of shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist under cover the supposedly filmed saying that members of Parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" m … "
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was right.
And I could ask a damn, but I did not do. "
The Member of Parliament, millionaire since his former position as oil trader, began to explain its expenditures, in May, after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before being in agreement with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in form of £in the lawn of M Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had asked GBP 4,000 for three years.
Questioned on the increase of the loan, the last night, Mr Duncan said: "This was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the fees office then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules, allowed, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "

Brighton is a place if creative and vibrant and we try to experiment and to represent this through the spirituality. "

The staff will not work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, Ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-alpes-auvergne.
At a time when we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable dare take the money of staff, says the Cgt-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.

But of all ways the account is not, the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François forget.

Counsel for the filmmaker Roman Polanski Franco-polonais called again Thursday in Los Angeles, California, Western United), abandonment of prosecutions against its client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of mores of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, counsel for the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal the second district of California serious procedural mistakes at the time, in 1977.
I am calling for the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, adding that the behaviour of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "Creepy".
According to him, the judge Rittenband -- died since -- would have discussed, before his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), the lips of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr Wells had finally declared late September "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the case where the Court refused to abandon the prosecution, Mr Hummel called a trial, which allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution has reiterated the arguments already developed in first instance, namely that any abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied as Roman Polanski would not before the Court.
The filmmaker, who is 76 years old, had fled the US in 1978, before the sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
It has never foot back to us.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor, Phyllis Asayama Roman Polanski, has stated that "must be there to present at the hearing".
In this case, do send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, "asked Mrs Asayama.

One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- has underlined "that there were other alternatives to the flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called, once again, the end of proceedings.
Recalling that his client no longer supports to be harassed every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".

After more than two months behind bars, he was under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

The association UDF increase the tone and the new centre of its acronym
The UDF, controlled by the Association François Bayrou, modem responded Friday to the attempt to takeover of the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym of the Länder Giscardien, putting it in is not to use it again on any support, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou does not deserve to defend his political legacy after he reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (Ex-ump happened in NC) who claims ownership of the mark UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou hearing not be deprived, is out of its silence to launch a formal notice to Minister and MP, instructing them to no longer use the logo and transmit the ownership of the mark, on pain of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you were going to offer your political movement of + + the acronym UDF, Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, and that Senator Jean Arthuis the centrist alliance.
You also fit to follow on your equipment and activist on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the slogan + + new Centre +, today the UDF +, see also the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this logo, the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "the name of the UDF immediately of any support and (his) Internet site".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass the property of (the) mark to its legitimate right holders".
If you didn't, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978 and remind Mr Morin and his friends had been" the choice "leaving in 2007" to create a movement competitor, as others had in 2002, to create the UMP ".
The new centre has therefore, in their view, no right to use the logo UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted its accession in 2007 in modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the material and moral interests "of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As to Hervé de Charette, continues the Bureau, "when he filed the mark", it was "no longer the UDF clearer for three years, but to the UMP.
It benefits scandalously and fraudulently of the Abscence for tabling the acronym UDF to conduct on its behalf.
This discourtesy is developing into crime, Dénoncent-ils, before irony on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is worthy to make a name for yourself trying to break the anonymity fraudulently a name which was not entitled".

For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been handled by the photographer, it considers as a long-standing friend.
While the Tribunal should examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-meyers, the pleadings of lawyers have sometimes turned to unpacking family Friday.
Thus, Counsel Liliane Bettencourt has three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-meyers's husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never spoken to him since her marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, new estimated that the complainant was not entitled to act, to much more than a guardianship judge has refused these last few days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place ", the department's representative asserted, Marie-chrsitine Daubigney.
The Tribunal finally decided that it would be a time that the trial will be held on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-meyers.

For more than a decade, the attitude of big business management in relation to its employees, recalls the position of vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" defined above as it was once, to dictate to consumers of products devised by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, revolution marketing has presented the strategies of conquest of markets to the spot... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected preferences factors populations return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The France Telecom suicides, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects the frameworks in particular.
This demobilization severely compromises the development of all the company ’ s intellectual functions, including of R & D and, even more, of the economic intelligence.
In effect, the EI "requires of all stakeholders (…) a proactive approach and a vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the revenue management authoritarian refuse totally.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of concerns of the company to the same as the client.
The usefulness any relative of opinion surveys internal
The opinion surveys internal – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its Salariés- will encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- first because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure in the end, after many detours, to priority … what it has always done.
- second, because authoritarianism – a pathologies of the Pouvoir- increases proportionally with the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From large schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by comfort intellectual, the old theory, reactivated recently by the "Behavioural Neuroscience" American and widely disseminated, unbeknownst to them, by research institutes and the media.
Thus, in suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos appeared in the Figaro.fr Conforte-t-elle leaders in a posture of governance mechanistic, unsuited to today ’ s world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, to adopt a vision finalist of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment the company is only possible if it is clearly as a means of achieving a part of their dreams, ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the analysis Motifonctionnelle adopt this conception of motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they deem their company based on a predetermined Doxa which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers to achieve their life projects.
Through the identification and the measurement of these factors of mobilization, the business leaders can monitor, anticipate and anticipate their "social" performance and put their human resources management to the location ".
They create a fertile ground for joint development of a robust economic intelligence and effective.
Speech of Oslo: the "just war" worth of Obama praise right
The American right has welcomed Friday speech the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the US.
The Conservatives, which presupposed the award to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he has said, "said Mrs Palin, Égérie of the Republican Party's right wing daily, USA Today, adding she herself sometimes addressed the theme of war 'necessary' in his memoirs that are to be published.
The war is the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists there, she said.
Mr Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, is employee Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the President had done in Oslo "a very good job '.
I found that the speech was very well, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential.
By some, I found this quite historic, "said Mr Gingrich, on the radio program" The Takeaway. "
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he is pleased to have seen "a left-wing President" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not free and could put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush pen converted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr Obama made "a very American".
In addition to appearing in "citizen of the world" he always does, "," it was described as an American president, "reminding European" that they live in a bubble of security that they did not create and that they do little to maintain, "said Mr Gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a Falcon from the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, has described the speech as "dull, turgid and inspiration" on the National Review Online.
Has the left of the President, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich has alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we envelope the war in the concept of justice, can easily justify the massacre of innocent, he warned.
The press of centre-left remained however Commendation to the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, has described his speech "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech Oslo "should serve as a road map for international guide decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", has ignited the Daily Californian.
Mr Obama "made the speech that he had," said the New York Times, "both dark and inspiring".
Road: three marathons for an agreement which saves the supplies of Christmas
After three rounds of Négociations-marathon, road sector unions and TLF, the only organisation to be stayed until the end, reached an agreement Friday night to end the word of strike and the threat to supplies of Christmas.
At the session Friday evening, the State Secretary for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, beginning Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left at the early morning Friday, with the hope of sign quickly in late morning the text of agreement.
And even though three employers organisations (FNTR, Unostra e) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11.00 for everyone to agree and that 00 the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for businesses" and "it was to be feared that it disrupt the holiday years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides a pay increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest international (transport).
In hourly rate, for macro, "is of EUR 8.72 9.06.
It is not much, but there is very far, explained Patrice closed (FO).
This is will give the order to our supporters that there are no barriers, no blockade of centres of supplies.
But you can always have some recalcitrant which are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on high salaries given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (TCRC) welcomed" a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (SGC) has raised "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3%, and the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau has pointed out that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' contributions was the subject of a Government amendment to draft amending Finance Act for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical".
The signing of TLF allows that the Agreement applies to a first time businesses adherent to that organization, and in a second time, the profession, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "expeditiously", has assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition employers ’ organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain", since the EUR 100 million "had already promised the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport has obliged us to negotiate in urgency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to thwart Turkey eaters the next eve, deplored the Unostra.
For the school, the agreement risk "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs sector in the next 12 months".

The Turkish Justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court said Friday the dissolution of the country's main Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risk to vastly complicate the task of government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it was a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the Court president Hasim Kiliç, at the end of four days of deliberation.
The decision was taken to the 11 judges unanimously, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to deliver the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of party officials, including its president Ahmet Türk and Member Armenia Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders have warned before the verdict that the Members leave the Parliament rather than to sit as members without label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey "directives of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase policy legal rebels of the PKK.
The party provides, however, that it has "no organic 'links with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government has to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to shrink the support of Kurds and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had stated dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Therefore the announcement of the justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered before the DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast populated in majority of Kurds.
The police have fired tear gas and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched Molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of Justice was "deepening despair."
The Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdish, stitch by banning a party, he said in a statement to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, has also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This resolves nothing, "said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a sinking total of democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, with a response of the PKK, "he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, off-limits to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts in Moscow under the Soviet regime, a research of the armaments secret, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" Soviet.
Of important sites of production and of micro- and nanoelectronics research are established.
Since September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have created links with Riedberg, instead of science Francfortois – with academic institutions and societies in the centre of Frankfurt (FIZ) innovations.
There were reciprocal meetings last Wednesday and of representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were the mayor of Moscow JURI Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section head project to Frankfurt.
In 2010 of representatives of FIZ and SMEs, which the strong point is scientific research, will be Zelenograd for a seminar.
Exchange scientific
It is a scientific exchange sustainable.
But also of economic relations.
It will enable companies of FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Has the Russian scientific societies seeking contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of Institutes and of Soviet famous research.
There is the Institute of Moscow ’ s electrical, large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-elektronika.

The project S21: a brake to Stuttgart
Cannot be placed high enough the Stuttgart 21 project.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe."
If we want. S21, it is more that the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a chaos despairing of shipyards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The head of the line stations, with which ended in town, had a reputation at the time to be the technical relics of transport of the 19th century who were effect of brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short, departure – that is to do.
This is why the head of the line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of trains, which is about halfway on the major trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of years 80 are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the head of the line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are trains modern, reversible with railcars and Voiture-pilote at both ends.
However, at present the achievement of Stuttgart 21 to the new location of the inter-city to Ulm.
The regional and local policies have prevailed.
The railway company is of the part because, it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of risks the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From the point of view planning this project is relatively well justified.
A – urban space is obtained if it believes the computer-generated graphics planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for traffic to which we assigned - and it is typical of years 80 - a huge growth.
At the time it did not yet exist the competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods because the transport by rail is much more respectful of the environment by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, EUR six billion will be swallowed in the draft of the Swabia.
It is the official figure.
Of Experts believe that ten to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will for other junction and congestion in the network.
The Department of Transport list mentioned in any sixty large projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres.
The line is built in slowed since 1987.
It would be really urgent to support here on the fungus.
But the project S21 had the effect of a clog.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of the international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgment rendered on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government has referred to the possibility of appeal to the Administrative Tribunal of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of the Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Tribunal and who is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the Aterrissage Northwest to Frankfurt airport was realized.
The permission to Attérir for 17 between 11pm and 5h the morning aircraft, as envisaged in the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution night.
The coalition must have decided for the 4 January if she wishes to an appeal in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this deadline and is trying to put pressure on the government to Celui-cirenonce representative to appeal before the federal administrative tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban night flights, otherwise it will be considered a failure total to a word.
It is damn hard to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-wazir in referring to electoral FDP slogan "We are keeping our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch refutes the allegations of Schäfer-gümbel who claims that the Land Government trying to allow the night flights using "Avocasserie and Roublardises".
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "rapid first impression.
That the decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning declarations of its fraction on the ban on night flights is completely erroneous.
The US banks repay the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their ties vis-à-vis the State.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (over EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted in the framework of the rescue plan tarp.
The chain of American television CNBC has indicated in a report that Citigroup also wanted to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions seeking to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of are, as for example limiting bonuses awarded to leader and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital by selling shares to investors that it has reported $19 billion of money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's coffers are full thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The Bank had assumed its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to get money on the financial markets to liberate themselves from the guardianship of the State.
The U.S. bank could launch Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, the CNBC reported citing the banking community.
The spokesman of Citigroup did not want to comment.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds which they had received.
Election accelerated
Finally everything when even spent more quickly than expected.
Has barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the position of editor Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wished to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who heads the drafting of ZDF was the favourite in Berlin.
However, the chain has not wished to confirm - officially – in order not to pre-empt the vote on the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the willingness to do no harm to the intendant of ZDF Markus Schächter on cases where the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, need the vote of 9 members of the Committee on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of the drafting of this edition.
It two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed the Board to extend the contract by five years of Nikolaus Brender, but it had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had reported favourable to the extension of Brender and 7 others had voted against. the dismissal by Brender represented a great failure although predictable for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is majority on the Board had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not want to renew Brender.
It is Roland Koch, the minister-president of the Land of Hesse who had organized a League against the editor.
He had refused to extend the contract of esteemed editor on the grounds that the ratings of emissions information of ZDF had fallen below Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denounced the growing political influence on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and which felt that the way Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will be for nothing.
Peter Frey: who is?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the science-policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) radio body and Frankfurter Rundschau (daily German national in scope).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF firstly the news magazine "Heute-journal today" (Journal).
Then his route continues: from 1988 to 1990, he was the assistant editor of the time, then corresponding to Washington in 1991 / 1992, and in 1998 he was Chief and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (bi-weekly issuance of information presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible of the foreign policy of the ZDF then Chief of Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, when it had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade magazine medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they submit a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch to Governing Council, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the removal of political figures who are members of committees responsible for monitoring the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the Governing Council in strongly criticising the Commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the Board could elect without that it suspects of the position a supporter policy.
In the representations arithmetic parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of strike educational the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: At a meeting between the ministers and delegates to the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students bachelor or master should be improved.
In the future, the students should be able to come to end of their studies.
They are set Accordpour lower the weight of tests: a single review should enable to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will be Reconsidée to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for the bachelor and master.
At the regional level, there should be no regulations different from land to land.
Less examinations
Since the protests began student last June, Minister of Education of the Länder and university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth with fashion: "Étudiabilité".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a specific meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to reduce significantly the number of some reviews: "Each Module should normally be concluded by a single review," read in a document of 30 pages of future conditions for admission to graduate.
Reinhold Grimm, President of Accreditation Council says that in reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop slippage that impacted significantly to Étudiabilité.
The 'Étudiabilité "should be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules like the bottom should be reviewed carefully to see if you cannot avoid this smothering sensation that you feel sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - according to the latest knowledge in raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
The students should "have the opportunity and the necessary room for manoeuvre to enable and facilitate the personal initiative.
The new regulation will access to new graduate university but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be re-certified "every 5 years, however, this means that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 accreditation agencies competent in the whole Federal territory which depend on Accreditation Board created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exercised a certain pressure on the Länder to weigh on agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the regime of not too strict.
In some Länder, the specialized universities and schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only land to have given its agreement to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programmes Tutorielset strengthening the offices of educational guidance and the offices of examinations and the Department of International Relations
The Länder and the universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
Early 2010, the Government wishes to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this there will be no more that one examination for closing its studies.
The organisation of studies it must be more flexible, more able to guarantee the recognition of other institutions of higher education transcripts and access to the master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, Étudiabilité "of all graduate will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The Décisionsont been appreciated but critics were heard.
The Federal President of the Student Union Socialist has indicated that it would like the organization of educational policy does not happen again in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and the heads of universities.
At the latest after the strike educational, students as the individuals concerned should be able to express a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates to the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK working on a joint project of reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls the right and the opportunity for each bachelor degree to enroll in a master cycle.
Andreas Keller Member of the Steering Committee of GEW also calls for the Länder ensure students bachelor today, that tomorrow there will be enough places for master and studies of study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
By contrast, ministers of education have not raised the possibility to ease access to the master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a poet Werner Söllner work, in which he describes in disturbing glimpses phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany has won the freedom but has lost its language area at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English to Bucharest and, subsequently, Director of collection in a publishing house for the youth before moving in Frankfurt.
Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 it was highly prized chair of poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and Since 2002 he is Director of literature of Hesse to the artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
There has been much talk in not literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, the theme of which was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers Germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as an informant for the police policy Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The trials of enrolment began in 1971.
I am, therefore, finds Söllner "someone who has not sufficiently stood Auxessais of intimidation of the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Honoration Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case which clearly shows the pitfalls and the baseness of a political system, based on policing and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, all that we can say after the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file IM Walter played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had Interceded in his favour.
"He had been able to draw from all difficult situations at the time," After Markel.
Markel has felt the need Moralde make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of its collaboration with the secret services Romanian is in fact, not so surprising.
The Germany is a reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit", after having read the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and will sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last the names of loans Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In Germany where the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitudes to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been frustrated and hindered in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a National Council corresponding to the institution Birthler was created to work with the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (Cnsas) but rather dragged the return of files since.
There is a law since 2005 which defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate Temesvar that, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, has expressed very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately we had questioned only once.
The infamy of power felt able to speak here, without any gene, under the pretext of freedom of expression.
Certainly, there are inevitable issues associated with the case Söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? which has been despoiled? the weighted response of listeners, to the admission of Söllner, hope that the result of this Chapter will be defined more by a thirst that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Up-and-down at the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative were there, fired four pins from any right of a Christmas party cool, on which the manufacturer of articles sport had spread its goods when new coach Vfb Christian Gross of midnight less a quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just to call, a plastic bag orange as a supplier to the hand.
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, was driving in the city which was foreign.
Otherwise our peers might take the wheel himself – he was not a drink and he was not drunk happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but he should go back to work tomorrow.
Because it is now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that had to engage three days earlier were clear: "We reached the eighth final", that is to say in the Champions' League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal fight not to fall".
The "work" We expected Sunday.
There, it is to repeat Mainz daily the results of the Champions League.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals expeditious de Maricá (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / return match 9 / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn at random the 18. December in Nyon.
Fulminant the joy of the entry into service of Babbel's successor was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate who had brought luck, who had sent to Stuttgart destabilized, motivation and the pleasure of play.
I have been to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" – gross - a recipe for success that sounded if Bienmais was more effects with the caregiver Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - 'in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we never thought possible ".
And Sami Khedira which, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" identified by a proverbial "costs" and the method of work of the new leader: "it is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation ".
But apparently Babbel had missed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet past the Cape warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, Vfb Stuttgart especially need tenacity.
Just as gross, the players and the manager kept to overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanians.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0: 4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but they are by others who were still far.
We have not yet past the difficult.
That Heldt the day its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, the events of the weekend that a television interview keeper's aim Jens Lehmann did rebound just before the start of the match.
There are other decisions that take and not Jens, Yamamoto Heldt, in response to the sharp criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the management of weakness on style and said that it had decided to change of coach under pressure from fans puberty.
Lehmann had also considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and Jalousiele fact that his day of free after the Games it was removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" slid Heldt and announced consequences for the custodian.
They more likely to become friends for life these two forties.
In any cast, they agreed to all the rest, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation sports and fighting would not have been possible.
Babbel and his aides were "wildly for a greater share in the success" Heldt and Lehmann to choir — and even the man in the plastic bag harm.
World championship heavy
Combat hot in Berne: Kevin Johnson challenger induced without constantly verbally and gestural the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles after the WBC version of the Federation.
Has the judges unanimously it imposed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retained the title of the world heavyweight champion.
The Federation WBC announced that in the Saturday night the champion of 38 years had won a victory points to the Unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defends with honour his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian had already twice won the title of world champion of Wbo federations and WBC.
Unfortunately it has not managed the much-needed KB.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional, say twice his defeat because of injury.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in 24 fight.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, its 2.02 metres, by the left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of champion, Empéchant Klitschko to enter his against the right dangerous.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried to go the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and deeds its coups reached very rarely the champion.
It is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, to be exceeded with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
It Insulta Klitschko him a "villain zombie" which "is not really capable".

This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of us.
"I just took a blow in this fight and I am in perfect form" had said Klitschko to explain his rapid return on the ring.
His Rève is trying to bring in the family four the most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is Wbo federations and IBF champion.
But it is the British David Hague who Détroné the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko which was to be held in September.
It appears that its promotion company now plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the minister of defence Guttenberg of lie in the case of the Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left Party (Die Linke) asking the Chancellor of explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - after review of recent information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) Délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the killing of two tanker trucks in last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday in the issuance of information chain ARD "Tagesschau" (the Journal of h).
In short, this means that he lied.
The order to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in substance, the content of the report available to the NATO and that has been read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of Lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the trucks stolen, but rather aimed to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike which was launched at the request of the German colonel Goerg Klein, military commander in Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have asked Saturday the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to vote as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel say clearly whether the massacre targeted strategy is part of the government's Afghan policy Fédéralet if the Chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in any way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voice became increasingly strong to express Doutesquant real reasons the removal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the Department.
According to the information in the Journal Spiegel, the information they had provided to Guttenberg about the attack on the trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they have concealed the existence of the NATO and hid the Minister some details.
In the entourage of two senior officials but it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert have meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
Until now, he has received no response
Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the federal Parliament's committee of inquiry was going to be the next Wednesday to the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mental patients, or under the effect of the drug, the boundaries between imagination and reality are converging.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, it works very well.
When we are elongated in our rooms clouded, we can explore dreams and fantasies without barriers and more.
However, awake, ’ s experience state of dream, hear and see things from the other not, quickly the reputation in our western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Of such images and voices do not appear in the mental patients or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to melt.
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, can be in various forms, in the best case it is called of the visions, at worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect be distinguished, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet of new age Carlos Castaneda, the latter States of shamans, psychoses, and hallucinations are attributable to very similar process.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmitter brain - first and foremost the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and Achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex of hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenia psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations, were a form of Rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between the madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who composed".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turn into character in a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to garish colours.
The attraction land has more power, it hangs swell the ceiling.
He feels a coup.
Behind him of devil winged creatures, Grimaçantes, mouth bleeding, showing teeth.
They continue, give him kicking with heavy boots, it against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Of voice Thundering, wicked, shouting, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer bear those voices that the insulting and humiliating.
Henning T. pulling two cables of its stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It climbs up on a Baffle and is the loop around the neck.
He jumps.
The loop is.
That you lesson, proclaiming the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum. 'care in a clinic and yourself! "
Today Henning T. 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis Schizo-affective, paranoid, in addition it is manic, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, those concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitation, that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, of folly relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voice which, which views or dialogue.
The hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the large and the small, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry Chu in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry IM Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is right in the centre of the situation, to a meaning focused on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and actively cannot act on them.
That is why the schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, wake is excluded.
To experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Has the difference of the dream, Fuchs said "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is collected during the psychosis, is basically retained".
The thoughts and hallucinations, delusions are based on reality, the disposal of lived in a real framework.
Why does our brain this kind of antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Of exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are small brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what still unexplained, this is how the neural system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is predisposition.
Of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
The crazy, said Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the psychotic suffering from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs for dispose while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain them.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten together for ten years reports of hallucinations and illusory images: the past year it has published its findings in a book entitled "the unreal world in our heads".
The hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also the migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer ’ s disease or head injury.
It is surprising to note that in some conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, composed of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take form when areas of the brain that process the sensory perceptions, are Hyperactives or not sufficiently Refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the pessimists of love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent studies, a third of participants acknowledged having done at least once in his life ’ s experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and goes to school.
A normal girl to do everything to say.
If there was not the images and voice.
During the recess, there is a young boy, thin, with long hair chestnut, address him the floor.
When she replied his comrades, look surprised – no one else see or hear this boy.
They believe that this girl is a lunatic Boggled but Sarah K no dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy like she sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even perceive its presence momentarily.
It is a good feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
Am I mad?, asks sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
The visions are often cumbersome.
When it is in class, it is that it can follow the course because the teacher is just present a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and that the professor is in train to explain equations table.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the dark of his house, it expects the sleep that is too little and too late, it often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dream, if the images sees, the faces Grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on the arms and legs are to his eyes open or closed.
Let quiet, Cree to these creatures.
It does not mention or to his parents or his friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. today 20 years.
She was LAC last year and she lives with her friend.
One year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact with the psychologist Kasten through the Internet she knows very well that it is not mad.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When a person is socially isolated or has not enough of stimuli, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough, so that there is the animation.
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of other children when it was small and often play only.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, the man she called Dad, since it was in age thinking, was not his real father.
This is the same brain areas that are active for visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for actual impressions and noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. "experience", according to Kasten 'place in the brain, the reality is formed from.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, dreams night are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mentally healthy people is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There was a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on awareness unfortunately has quickly tend to take experiences imaginary for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-degenhard, Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard studied form of Oniroïde experience, a particular form of the conscience stirred by the dream.
The experienced Oniroïdes are very complex Semi-rêves that are perceived as genuine by the lives and cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of arousal.
The state of consciousness Oniroïde for a trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients with Polyradiculopathie that fully aware, experience of motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation which affects his life by his own imaginary world is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation is in itself unacceptable, a capacity for organisation which we is given, to the men, to not fall in the nil loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian also describes his experiences Oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as safeguard action of the soul.
He was 49 years, when its aware share for a trip of several days after a heart valve operation followed a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen into a world that he has created all parts, site visit foreign, journey through time. It is old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot to his bedside ensuring on her health.
He lives in the Middle Ages of noble which manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is abducted by a Greek motorcycle which take in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the Firn Alps and encounter a Mafia Korean.
It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
To Claussen these domestic travel is fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, wrote in describing what he experienced.
On the contrary dreams, memories from travel mental are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience Atomises the horizons of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard.
In short, the Oniroïdes, psychoses, delusions, hallucinations and experiences we show how our representations home of external reality are fragile even in Eve.
Any change of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can result in a distortion of what we call the reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snows fall
Burda
Has 27 years, the children will following the House of editions.
The Kallen for appointment to the position of CEO of Éditions Burda is an intermediate solution: longer term, Hubert Burda hope that her two children the press, he told the newspaper group Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - long-term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of children
The two children inherit 27 years and are firmly committed to integrating society, "said Hubert Burda, 69 years, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will by the result.
It will see also if they are able.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 employees without whether they have the capacity to do.
This Démolirait children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the CEO post in January and that his successor was Paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
At first, it was responsible for the technology sector.
By following it held the sector Treasury it is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the business and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
And for the first time this is not a member of the family who is at the head of Éditions Burda.
Burda's children were respectively 19 and 17 years, his son, Felix would today, 42, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years "
Burda stipulates that the holding must remain at 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always been held in the families who are left by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous speculation unfortunate, believing that they could climb ever higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never had Rêvede universal power, Burda said.
I see absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a mechanism which allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the opportunity even to see some kind of attachments or surf the Internet.
He took of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the designated as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for youth.
Unlike smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription prices and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service of life, data for six times more expensive than peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event the web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited its Grand-frère American, but includes a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately €12, includes the roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what to give to data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the (or a connection FON WiFi) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is time that it should operate.
In fact, some operators have special arrangements and options journey, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a thesis in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the agenda of the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have a barely perceptible effect.
To the outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and is not wrong.
That a small device as the Fonpeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that the operators are beginning to think differently and studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and boat.
It is a device connected and you pay on its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the Fonpeek: an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the US.
I do not want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope that simply because I believe that it is a more fair to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the service of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and coat of the color, it has, in fact, chosen the same for the accompanied in the second moment, no doubt, the most important of his life: the award in Oslo of the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Michelle Obama was very similar model in these two occasions: besides their colour, a yellow firing towards green with brilliant, twice, held consisted of three parts: the dress, jacket and the mantle, in the same tissue, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
So that ’ s a first glance, it appears that the first lady of the United States follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and had chosen to submit the same held.
But the tissue in which are cut both sets makes very different.
If the service it was a lace thick, however, it was in Oslo a velvet printed.
The accessories are also different: footwear Green Talon plea for the first opportunity, and a similar model but, this time.
The hair she has also changed: the hair is now records when it was released last time.
75% of working mothers had problems due to their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for younger generations who women want to be mothers.
This is what study reveals "fertility and career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The investigation, conducted on 9 737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their career limited due to motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the type of job.
Those who have no activity outside the home, working part-time or have a stable work little, more earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy and have more children.
In contrast, women having stable employment, mainly in the public sector, Repulse entry in the conjugal life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, in average, 3.7 years after being installed in couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "The data show that women having stable employment have more time in their lives to obtain, which took them to extend the Union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment influence largely maternity, but less the date the beginning of living together, "says researcher of CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher education were mothers respectively for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another Distinctness is also between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have studies basic marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with higher average level studies or reverse this programme and give priority to the achievement of a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is worth well
L'Oréal Paris is to add a new name to its list envied ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the actress German embody the image of several products of the mark, playing the motto "because I Vaux universal good."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, is thus join other celebrities in L ’ Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last in this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in lost).
The price of British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, met for their annual awards, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, elected best model of the year.
The poker as of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent we offer in Poquer of Acso (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 30 "x-ray" of writers who crossed her literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not depending predictable and apprehended (summary biographical, life and work), but in seeking something similar to the core of ignition of character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent savings nor the spawning or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and reviews.

A cowardly aggression
The last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent next to it and our dog, a spa and Sang-mélé, saved not weighing more than six kilograms and, without word, they Assenèrent two birds feet who left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see that there is a funny to attack a free small animal without defence which, moreover, was on a leash.
To this we must add the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and that when it Injuria these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a Énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person lower than him.
The episode was held to 17 hours, a Tuesday as another, in a normally quiet.
The dog was Gémi throughout the day.
We have heard filed a complaint to the office of district even if we doubt that this used to much and do not touch the sensitivities, we just want to say that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in the youth so that they find fun to mistreat a defenceless animal gives us free of the affection, friendship and is company.
We do not know where is the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet use
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, primarily among motorcyclists the young, as have said today the two structures.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to prevent head injuries or even death in cases of accident in two wheels.
Michelin indicated that the campaign was in line his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always more safe" and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative in nature.
This new campaign for encouragement of helmets in two wheels, under the motto ‘ to be or not to be ", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that the road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progress
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the figures of the employers' federation of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, dealers.
However, we need to qualify the good news since the reference for the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations gathered during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all the vehicles which fall in the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and light trucks to chassis light) 95 853 were sold.
The dark clouds that affect their application are not dispelled. In effect, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, it must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation and the difference of passenger vehicles, the aid to the purchase of the 2,000th have little.
Addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, may also qualify, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, reminded again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to commercial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, for which she calculates a fall in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) 19%.
The emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As has occurred with the ABS anti-lock braking system and this will take place with the control of ESP stability, the emergency brake assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the remaining vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, has for objective to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by the mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system thanks to foot given by the driver.
But it does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident could not slam on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in Revancha, requires the brake system, reducing the distance which the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that a sinister on four with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and while the collision is inevitable, the device has the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors repels until January the plan for Opel
When workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were alerted by Nick Reilly, president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably the 8 – after Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that he will need more time to conclude the contingency plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, means that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this could mean that the final document, which will be subject to the workers, then the governments of countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, among GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has tightened pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits be in contact with potential new buyers.
The one of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidature of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, takes the importance.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewellery, the Porsche engineers are Boxster s and parties have managed to the thinning of nothing less than 80 kilograms, which leaves only balance 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, in the first place, of the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof Bâché 21 kg, manual, to reduce to employ aluminum doors as Wg3, 15 other kilos of less, to remove conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, climbing Bacquets of sport, 12 kilos, and light with tires of 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they have relinquished the audio system Cdr-30 and six other kilograms and have replaced the Poignéesdes doors by handles in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the KDP to double clutch, the test was carried out on a standard model of six speeds, mainly on routes of secondary network of California, mountain, with turns particularly tortuous.
Its behaviour can be described as excellent.
Reducing the weight does not prevent the car of travel on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was long that we had not tested a model also small and light which, at the same time, guarantee security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of its relaxed Musclesà small speed for the necessary time, until what we ask them to Sprinter, stop, to recover and push its engine …
It is out what we wanted. Thanks to its leadership, also communicative as specified, the car will do what will our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
His engine to will
The sound of his V6 Boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster s) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either to the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The roads that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed potholes.
The electronic assistants to penalty act on the entire journey, while some turns we have found ice in early morning and gravels, later in the morning.
In short, a car Ultralégère, fun to drive and is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The cars will be the sale in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.
"bag girl"
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld line icon Coco cocoon and Starlette occasional parades of the House, the singer declares its face of bad girl with as much capacity as its bags Chanel.

The second quarter was in the same tone, but the team of Alava has chosen the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause of return to its former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic began to be noticed as the best player of his team with 13 points, while the "least six" splitter ’ s assessment was already expected that this night would not be the best of Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that you win if not easily on their land, and through "the hand of Elias ’, they managed to enter in the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players from Ivanovic, injured but, far from being dead, had to pick up a few skilled actions to take the air, and it is at this point the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three baskets to three consecutive points and aid to English and Ribas enunciating the meter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the local managed to widen at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The team of Avala out to play the whole during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) bureaucrats that they were tired person to take what they had earned during the thirty first minutes.
However, Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, is not rally and tried to support since the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players from Ivanovic is not rushed, defended, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80-85), the part was already performed and the victory outside of Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injuries prevent Unicaja of battle

The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the final exit the fulcrum Scottish Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the baskets, three points to cook, and support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos showed implacable when players were lobbying and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.

The Brazil set a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the legation diplomatic 27 January 2010 at the latest, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d ’ Affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave the 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination".

Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation has been the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty springs again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where the officials take decisions on a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly in giving abundant liquidity at close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets were virtually finalised, and without calling into question their political maverick of liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their adjudication to a year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without measures heterodox and we are witnessing a of the compression reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the obligations of undertakings to rise again, although they remain very remote Parapsychology and occultism they have reached levels at the beginning of the year.
The States were obliged to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There are new a flight to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters chosen by investors, provocative an increase in differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
The Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor its threatened with a new revision to the lowering of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral hazard, that a case of trying new awareness among Lesresponsables in global economic policy which had hindered the destructive effects of limiting the credit derivatives on the destruction of the employment, whereas this that it should do is introduce a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheikhs to restore power in the UAE and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the pot to roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves the Hungary for non respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a country member of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
This which is logical, it is that Ecofin has led the Greek government transparency and its citizens responsibility of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as our differences of the public debt increase to the obligations of European companies, Nousn not to worry.
If the differences decreased and that our continued to increase, it would then have an idiosyncratic risk Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our forward-looking indicators require the most studies to anticipate their services models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who returned to the charge with a Japanese model Pourl Spanish economy, it does not bode much hope for their warning.
Of new, it has the air of an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, although for the moment "caution is mother of safety".
Sectors connected
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the President of gas Natural-fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press what he had told the Sub-Committee, to camera.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million between this date and 2030, in the case where nuclear power stations today in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but 95 000.
By Iberdola considers that for the next decade, however, the investment must not be used to increase the production capacity, but international distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question exchange, and it will increase the power.
His bet is focused on the gas to coal plants, with recovery of carbon dioxide mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW of more are needed, with other "energy of support".
Galán, who believes that the bill a sustainable economy that the government has approved is in line with what calls his company, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was "a clear with long-term" in this way, despite the measures "Walk-ins", as qualified the President of Iberdrola.
What it is, Galán considers that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must be taken, because they take time before reaching their maturity and a profitable stable framework is needed to address them.

On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money reported in the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex distribution of money procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini provides to gain 1 090 million through the Champions League.
Of this amount, the UEFA will 285,413.1 million in fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who have participated in classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 EUR for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (EUR 800 000) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in Eighths of final three million each, the eight teams who arrive in a Quarter-final Reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for having won the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are varying payments, which are spent 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four dedicated places.
The champion of the previous year pocketing 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in the edition of the current year.
