What is said? The SSD in Prague does not know even to Voldemort even the cake shop
The new town councilors of the SSD in the capital are going to have to surpass, as it seems, the evident linguistic barriers so that the components of the Board of Prague and of the municipal Board understand its renewed colleagues of the ODS.
The period Aktuáln.cz "examined" the members of the new Board of the SSD to check its knowledge of the language marked slang that has risen up in the last years in the Board, when the current members of the coalition governed Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the flower and political whipped cream of Prague during the previous period, of the mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes better known of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proved that the new town councilors do almost not understand those known concepts.
At least, that say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know it."
"I am rather a novice in the praguense policy," stated during the examination of terminology of "colegueo" the town councilor of culture Lukás Kaucký.
And as for the political veteran, equal Karel Bezina reacted.
Perhaps they know the concept "hollow of golf."
"Possibly it is the only expression of all those that you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, normally I do not use slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuáln.cz last June before the congress of poll of the ODS, the writing chose six examples, particularly those that are specially related with the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "bigger hollow of golf of Prague," "to go to the cake shop,""nape of bull, treason of the capital" and "to armor."
Three town councilors agreed to submitting to the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, who in future will be responsible for the education in Prague, at first accessed, but he did not catch the telephone again.
The fifth town councilor, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to making it.
"I do not put in these things nor think to value how they enjoy themselves the civic democratic."
"What yes imports me is how we will understand in the execution of our programs," indicated.
As it has been seen, the town councilor Lukás Kaucký would supposedly not have realized that the previous bond is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of the exmayor Bém, Roman Janousek.
The word "Voldemort" does not tell anything to Kaucký; the only term that he guessed in the examination is "the bigger hollow of golf of Prague."
It "is about the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, which adds immediately: "But I rather know it for the news."
"I am going to have to note myself to a course of languages," jokes.
Karel Bezina is not the only one that he recognizes the tunnel Blanka in the hollow of golf, but also the town councilor of Environment Lukás Plachý.
Afterwards, both sociodemócratas know who is really Voldemort and Lukás Plachý even knows how where to find that character; besides, he suspects the meaning of "going to the cake shop."
"I think that it means to go to a company of Prague"; soon it is revealed To Plachý that it is about the headquarters of the companies of Janousek.
The same as Bezina, indicates that such the knowledge it obtained them of the news, but that does not use such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the proof, among the sociodemócratas there is not any glossary that is so familiar of colloquial terms.
"I asked to my colleagues, but really it seems that we do not have at all similar."
, Among us we rather use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we do plays on words with the names," says the president of the SSD praguense, Petr Hulínský, whose colleagues of match call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bíza, but I do not know whether my colleagues also call me like this," confesses its own nickname Karel Bezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln.cz put the name to proof and works.
For its colleagues of match, Weinert is Dda (similar to "grandad") or, less friendly, Ddek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, who deceits were associated with before the choices during the sponsorship of the match, receives the nickname of "Igráek" ("playmobil") on the part of some of its colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the sociodemócratas tolerate in the parole in the match.
Hulínský does not like Hulda to call it, but the newspaper Aktuáln.cz discovered even other nicknames for this praguense president.
"The doctor of the laws of the clubs" as it seems remembers that Petr Hulínský obtained its doctorate in Law in the academy of policeman of Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "witches," as it published in a brochure
The women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, can not work, for example, for reasons of health, are single and do not have children.
The women that he "return" witches are sent to an area isolated, so that they do not hamper the rest of the people.
"The men rarely suffer such but."
"The healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help in the works and have children," explains a nun that, in the capital of the state of Africa occidental Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from its communities.
The local Government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure."
It emitted an informative brochure that it should contribute towards avoiding the hunt of witches.
However, this has a snag.
"More of 70% of the adults in Burkina Faso it does not know how to read," warns the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of the sensitization in writing.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Desire, adjacent country of Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah, of 72 years, died when three women and two men tortured her, covered it of gasoline and burned it.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors state that it owed to an unfortunate cumulus of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman caught fire in the oil that is used for the ritual anointings.
It was fastened "to the bad spirits" ablaze when the group wanted to "expel" of the woman.
People of all the educational levels support the insulation of the "witches."
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a businessman of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The voracious ones of human souls always represented a danger," stated.
Whereas in Burkina Faso the Government tries to calm the hunt of witches, in Gambia the year passed still the president took part in it.
"The Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of its aunt, threw a wide hunt of the witches that, supposedly, had been related with its death and had tried to kill the president himself through the black magic."
"To help it it brought to shamans of the near Guinea that, proteges for policemen, soldiers and the personal bodyguard of the president, were taken by force to men and women chosen randomly among the Gambian people to the estate of the president "in Kanilai," the organization indicates in its report International Amnesty.
In the estate, the arrested people had to drink a potion of grasses up with hallucinogenic effects that, besides, provoked them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arresteds did not survive the stay in the estate.
After the international pressure, they finally released about a thousand arrested people.
The tenant of Bakala: it warms up with stoves of coal and it signs a higher rent
The man, of advanced age and strong, RPG Byty of the "magnate of the coal" Zdeek Bakala, the oldest owner deprived of flats for rent in the Czech Republic, crossed the doors of the customer center of the company.
Under the arm it took some documents with the new contracts for rent of three flats: his, that of its daughter and that of its son, who is complying with sentence.
The liberalization of the rents has just caught the three of them.
Instead of 3.500 Czech crowns per month, the son will pay from the next year 4.100 crowns through a flat of two stays with cooking separated from second category.
"Besides, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a boiler of solid fuel," shows with the finger the man in the new contract of its son, on whose firm it has full powers.
"But I signed it," means resigned itself, explains annoyed means.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which qualified the new conditions for rent as "incorrect and indecent," recommends the tenants who do not sign the new contracts and for whom they wait up to the 7 of December, date on which it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But, in front of this, the man who is so alone does a gesture.
"Every cual says a thing," says with bad face.
Ostrava is converting in a big laboratory of proofs of the liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the great majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were up to the moment under a regulated rent.
That's why, Aktuáln.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The mining waiting room of RPG is one of the four of Ostrava and, Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Exactly beside the doors the guards are of safety and to its side a machine to catch number.
"Rent 2011," can be read in a luminous button of its tactile screen.
When pressing it, a papelito goes out from the machine with a number.
Almost does not have time nor to read "157" and already the number appears in the big screen situated at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Little afterwards, a marriage of advanced age arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rents.
The majority of the people comes to solve usual problems, as formerly: applications for hotfixes, questions of the insurance and similar matters.
The cards with the new contracts for rent will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44.000 flats belonging to RPG around of mid November.
RPG Byty suggests an increase of the rent of between the 15th and 38% to them in the cards.
On the 18th of November a special window opens in the customer center for the new rents.
"Has been working a week, so it is starting," the workers that are found as journalist in it when the customer is presented answer, after doubting briefly.
The liberalization and the former flats for miners of Bakala are the most delicate subjects in the area.
Before the choices, the vice-president of the Parliament, native of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the SSD, already treated them tall and clear, and they now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years afterwards I want a new ground."
"They not even changed me the damned dish of the bath," the mentioned man lets go in the introduction.
As the workers, for the moment come more than anything retired to prove whether they receive a discount in the rent if they sign in time, as it promises the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before the 15th of December will receive likewise half of the discount on the rent of February.
However, the window of the "mining "liberalization" does undoubtedly not manage to dissipate the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers that were here yesterday, only they asked for the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," appreciates the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG suggests in the web and in its planks carrying out individual meetings on the contracts when it is necessary.
If both parts do not arrive to an agreement on the rent, an independent judge will have to solve the question.
"It is not dealt of a threat, but of information on the only mode of proceeding possible and completely according to the law," notices RPG on its pages.
"Here nobody is going to be judged," one of the employees of RPG Byty gives an opinion and a man that she meets in the street in front of the customer center proves it, at least partially.
"Receipt a guesthouse of 13.000 and I have 5.000 for the food; I do not have average to go to the courts," states.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We will already see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the means that they do not sign, as soon as perhaps the people wait," gives an opinion.
The regulation of the rent will stop existing in the majority of the Czech Republic to beginnings of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
"The current rents yet do not cover even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the background of the community," remembers Pavel Klimes, director of the residential wallet of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the background of the community that annoys the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
Whereas during the five years that between 2005 and 2010 RPG went by he could invest four billion with the rents in apartments, in the four years that they will go of 2011 to 2014 the cipher will increase at 5.200 million.
The big screen that he hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that they highlight in red.
"The increase of the rent in 2011 by 15% and less is applied to 31.200 apartments, that is, more of 90% of the estates of RPG."
"Besides, it will always be at the most 7,50 monthly Czech crowns per square meter," is indicated in the screen.
Only I increase the rent of 400 flats of the wallet of RPG by 38%.
"In such cases, it is an increase from some extremely low quantities, of 19,66 crowns per square meter," indicates RPG.
In 2.600 flats, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect at once to the rents, but will be climbed among four at eight years.
Besides, he adds the following appointment: the company will invert all the money of the rise of the rent (consult the diagram) of new in the flats, mainly in saving in heating: new windows and heating.
The people who sign the agreement of rise for rent will have priority.
The architects have understood that the offices also need nursery
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
Nobody would say that it hides a small nursery with all the necessary to such facilities also in its interior: walls of colors, creative furnitures and even a park in miniature in the exterior terrace.
Since October of the last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can go to it.
The company of architectonic projects Arch.Design, from whose study numerous known buildings of Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the building Avriopoint about including a space for its mininursery.
In the company they work about 90 people, mainly in the age of the boom baby and wanted to allow the work the architects and draftsmen being able soon to return after the maternity.
Together with the possibility to enjoy a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the profits that Arch.Design to its workers offers within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The mininursery was an idea about the employees of Arch.Designu themselves and, with the support of the address, they managed to obtain financing of the European Union and of the Ministry of Work and Social Matters.
The mininursery of the company is financed through the European Social Background within the framework of the operative Program of human resources and employment, as well as of the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing granted (an endowment of more than 2,8 million Czech crowns) they could buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When it uses the financing (two years) up, the company Arch.Design has the duty to maintain the mininursery in functioning with its own backgrounds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the presentation of the application for financing it contributed the company Economy Rating.
The attention of the children is in the hands of qualified staff; besides, a nurse and a professor of the Ministry of Education are present all the day for its cares. The nursery at present receives unlimited children of age, although most of them has less than three years.
Since it is a "mininursery," so alone can receive simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the turns they go more during the day.
The functioning of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs for the fathers and the children of all the workers have the same law to using the nursery, independently of the hierarchy in the company.
Although they are a teaching and individual cares, the contents of the program of the mininursery are comparable to the program of the usual continuative education.
In it the children not alone play, but they also receive a teaching of quality: from the basic learning up to the preparation for the school, they show up to English.
The class not alone has of toys and table games, but also of a computer for the children.
The presence of small children in the company itself to create a friendly and positive atmosphere.
The fathers can go to see its children in any moment and avoid the stress of collecting late the children of the school when it is far from its working place.
Thus, the fathers are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this generates a relation of loyalty between the worker and its employer in a natural way.
This way, Arch.Design is situated among the companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, all in all, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The home of the bones keeps being fascinated after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof seems the loin of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur and the balconies seem the open mouth of a fish.
Like this it is the Home Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its form similar to a skeleton, the sites nicknamed it "the home of the bones."
Its organic forms, its showy colors, the new use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that remembers to the scales and the omnipresent softly curved lines, all that is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the home plays with oneiric lines, delicate colors and textures taken out of the nature and out of the fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order, is observed.
At night, all the façade of the home still seems more impressive, since it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
It winds and the torsion of the forms keeps surprising us also in its interior.
The wavy wood copies the frames of the windows, the banisters, the ornaments of the doors, the spy holes and the signs.
The Home Batlló, which he finds in the neighborhood of Eixample at number 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig de Grácia, rose up from the remodelling of a home of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the home was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, at first insisted on bringing down the previous building and starting of zero, but he soon accepted the idea about Gaudí of carrying out a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Home Batlló, formed by different apartments, alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project ornaments rose up for the apartment representative of the owner of the estate and the mosaics used in the façade.
In the façade also working other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol took part in the construction of the Home Milá and of the park Güell de Gaudí, in which they find other parts of it.
Due to its organic form, the sites little after its ending nicknamed it "the home of the bones."
Others, due to the mechanism specific to opening of the windows started to call it "the home of the yawns."
It is said also that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, boss of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaudí projected a unique system for the period of central heating with vents of ventilation and the typical chimneys in the home.
Its dip of forty-five degrees can be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the norms of construction of the moment at all and was not let be influential for them.
Still like this, the construction obtained the corresponding license from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years afterwards, to its ending, the town council was kept so struck with the result that asked that it corrected itself.
The construction including columns even up to the public sidewalk bothered it, for example.
The hotfixes were never carried out, rather on the contrary: so alone fifteen days after the application for the town council, Josep Batlló requested (and it obtained) license for renting the two most upper flats of the building.
In the inferior flats the owner himself installed himself.
In the gallery of the second flat the room was found and in the third flat the bedrooms and the part deprived of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry.
The home, of six flats, is completely crossed by some stairs that it takes up to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all the angles and direct lines, covering them of curved walls.
Gaudí worked likewise with the modern concept of connection of the space.
The common part can be connected completely opening the doors of the rooms and a bigger group can be communicated in this troublefree way, without the necessary privacy being renounced for more intimate conversations.
The home, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not alone obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional flats.
It is impressive likewise how Gaudí plays with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior courtyard and skylights.
The game with both colors provides the maximum of light in all the flats of the home.
It was based simply on the beginning of which the white reflex more light that the dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sunbeams.
Any person can visit the Home Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the list of world patrimony of the humanity of the Unesco.
In the first flat of the home it finds the apartment roomiest and most filled up with the ones accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and they extended the visits to the common area and to the loft, the terrace of the roof included.
The price of the entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaches the 16,50 euros, although the students, the retired people and the headlines of the touristic cards obtain 20% of discount.
The amount surpasses the price of the entry of other constructions of Gaudí considerably in the city.
If he wants to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its towers of lizard, it should be done friend quickly of some resident of the adjacent homes and visit him at home.
How are the mattress and the spring mattress chosen: the women and the men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface the mattress and the spring mattress to be knocked down, that is.
First of all they must be complemented to the perfection so that they are adapted to the specific users.
During the choice numerous elements come into play, including the peso, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress is situated and the spring mattress is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a hut of weekend that does not usually have heating, mattresses of latex must not be used because he "warm up" more slowly.
Besides, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual mattresses of polyurethane do.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn round for them more frequently.
If the channels of the center are not aired appropriately and, above, they are on a firm base, they maintain the humidity inside. Even mold can appear below.
At the time of choosing a bed, they also influence the habits.
The one who has passed a lot of time abroad, often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems to feel well in a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who returned from the NHL complained about here their not sleeping just as well."
"For its crushed shoulders, checks and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are recommended also for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, for what they receive the information of the articulations badly and of the skin," it explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in the padded furniture.
Many hockey players, as other customers, take time preferring the mattresses of viscoelastic one.
"Today already not there is problem, because they have these adequate Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
Any longer it does not have to be a player of the NHL to be able to notice the viscoelastic one.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and form according to the absorbed heat or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not give turns as after a hard match.
Simply, falls asleep better.
The viscoelastic one also works as protection against the ulcers.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of its feet at its height, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, of 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For example of bachelors, in the case of the single rooms it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also convenient.
"If not, a simple norm can be applied to calculate the width: when being knocked down facing upwards, should have the comfortably shrunk hands towards the elbows, the engineer recommends Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu alouník to dekoratér, that already takes many years being in charge of the issue of the healthy dream and of the ergonomics of the furniture, subject that shows in the specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own spring mattress and mattress, so during the purchase attention has to be paid to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to get on the somieres at different heights, which is not always possible in all the beds.
The mattresses of foam should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with interior of docks a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that is adapted to the forms and softens.
"When touching it with the hand or when being accommodated in the mattress, the docks should undoubtedly not be noticed," notices Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a type of specific spring mattress.
The completely padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and the base are as Siamese, do not have meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and its cover can not be washed, which today is often made.
And since every night we, between 0,2 and 0,75 l of sweat, perspire, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remember us to one big (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists refuse the eslóganes that talk about a life of the mattress of even 25 years or, even, of an accountability forever.
However, everything has one but.
That's why, the vendors give a board: in the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, be in charge of the cleaning carefully and of the one washed of the cover, but best add a protector of mattress that can be withdrawn and wash easily.
Although at present covers of mattresses with closing in all its perimeter are fabricated, therefore when opening them they stay in two parts (something very important for the wash and the size of the washing machine!), its manipulation in the models of biggest size (and for a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem a fight between a fly peso and a heavy peso.
In the bed, instead of a spring mattress, does it have a firm board?
Never!
At the most for the beds thought so that they pass a night the visits.
However, it must do (if you do not have them any longer) vent holes in the board and must be used with a mattress with docks in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
The mattresses of polyurethane must not be used on such bases.
For the somieres of sheets not articulables and that they contain between 14 and 18 sheets, mattresses of latex or sándwich mattresses can be used (for example, a combination of latex and fibre of coconut), although a spring mattress with a bigger number of sheets is always better, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and its rigidity can be regulated.
The somieres of articulables sheets must not be used with a mattress of docks, since it does not react to the reclinación.
Besides the adjustment of the rigidity of the sheets, also the protection of shoulders can be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets which it allows the shoulders to press or, even, which to incline the sheets so that they "surround" perfectly during the dream.
For the men who have some very wide shoulders, it is something very important.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "masculine" ones, started to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders remember them.
They also remember the women, for whom they put a softer area about the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somieres with structure in cross or of small boards with the called multitorsion absorption.
The pressure is distributed among different points and the tension is reduced.
It must take also that, even if it uses the adequate mattress and spring mattress, if it uses a bad pillow (big and "softened"), most of the advantages will disappear into account.
The norm basic is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners alone can arrive up to the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can relax.
The recommended adequate size is of 50 x 60 cm, a little normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying down of side, the pillow must be at the same level (when it is combined with the spring mattress with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders must.
The modern mattresses have something to do, as it seems, with the original mattresses stuffed with straw.
The manufacturers keep using, every time more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, the mattresses are in fashion biological.
The raw materials with oil, with which the foam of polyurethane is fabricated, are filled in with natural oils, for example of castor-oil plant or soya.
In fact, practically all the well-known manufacturers use soya.
"Biological, in the case of the mattresses, it means that the center is fabricated only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vasíek of the company Tropico Plus.
Likewise, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the cover of the mattresses, one of the first side aloe.
But the microcapsules can also be opted, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are likewise differences for men and women.
Whereas the men he "refresh" with vegetal extracts of breeze, so that the cover of the mattress absorbs the heat and refreshes the body, the women prefer "warming up" the cover.
The extract of red pepper improves the circulation of the blood, so the women feel more warmth.
The favourites at present?
The manufactured mattresses of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, that makes be more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The cold and viscoelastic combination of different rigidities of foam allow to fabricate mattresses of different areas that know perfectly where the head goes, the shoulders and the checks.
A mattress of good quality will cost to him of seven thousand crowns for above.
Those that have a therapeutic function usually have an inferior VAT, since they are considered as sanitary means.
The first that obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is complicated to save in the mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes the offers of the manufacturers or vendors, who on occasions offer two mattresses for the price of one, can be approved.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers mattresses Duofreeze with a foam with memory Memory stuck to the cover by 11.990 crowns.
The second is obtained freely.
The era of the viscoelastic one with an open cellular structure and a great density it began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
At first it rose as material for the NASA, because during the takeoffs loas astronauts were seen submitted to an enormous overload.
Tempur goes soft with the heat and hardens with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure in an optimum way.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid ulcers being produced, although also to improve the comfort during the dream.
The viscoelastic foam not alone is used in the mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as its circulation.
The national manufacturers, for example, use the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
Every time more fathers use devices of follow-up of people to control its children
The fear for the children leads every time more people to think about controlling them for GPS.
The system, at first thought for the follow-up of vehicles, can also follow the movement of the people and contribute like this Anika Janatková, for example, in case as the disappearance of the girl of nine years.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of matches, but it will soon come down to the size of a clock.
The case of the missing Anika gave fear to many people and it started to inform itself about the available means to protect better its children.
Even at the expense of to invade its privacy.
"We all try to say us that is not about spying, but about another means to decrease the possibilities of a tragedy being produced," Weil, one of the suppliers of devices of follow-up in the Czech market, considers Petr Pilin of the Macro company.
"I recognize that, in specific cases, such devices can be misused, for example if they are put in the bag of somebody without its knowledge, but still we have not run into such cases."
"Most of the customers really buy it for reasons of safety," adds Pilin.
In its opinion, the children should always know for what it serves the "cajita" and how it is used in the event of emergency.
The infantile psychologist Dana Boková warns on the fact that, if the child does not want to take it, it will simply throw it.
"Even the smallest children show great creativity at the time of losing deliberately specific things if they want to prevent their controlling them."
"Before, the fathers trusted enormously in the mobiles, but these could fade away as easily as the device of follow-up," states Boková.
In its opinion, it is debatable if in the event of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always prove whether the child takes any type of electronic device that can reveal its location."
"Now it is the telephone."
"As the use of the devices of follow-up keeps being extended, it will also search them, since its sale will undoubtedly be carried out with a lot of publicity.."
"In such cases, the criminals always go a crossing in front of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an attack improvised of a pedophile.
According to Robert ech of the company RC Monitoring, who offers services of follow-up as much for vehicles as for people, even if, after an attack, the device of follow-up is destroyed immediately, its presence can act as help.
"The device can be configured so that it sends regularly the position after a specific period."
"If it suffers damages, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices take integrated a measurer of dip for what if the person is simply slipped and is remained immobile, the device will emit immediately a warning with the position in question ," states ech.
In its opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with the intelligent mobile telephones with navigation, in which only a special software must be installed.
The problem of the current units of follow-up is that for the moment they are devices with a size similar to a box of matches or the mobile telephones of smallest size.
Therefore, they can get lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason proofs are being carried out at present with devices that seem a digital watch.
"Besides, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor does perhaps not identify the device."
"Or that it identifies it after a certain time, which can do that the police gain time," adds.
Even if the devices of follow-up are taken in the doll or hanging, they will keep using the same technology that is used for the follow-up of vehicles.
It is about the checking of the combined position with a system GPS (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) with the function of a mobile telephone that the current position communicates.
The army has sufficient wicks as to surround all Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to fasten explosives.
The year the Ministry of Defense passed already added kilometers of wick to its arsenal 224.
Therefore, they have existences for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is of two years, four at the most.
The army bought the wick for explosives to the STV Group, to. s. for forty million crowns.
The staff of the General answered to MF DNES justifying the purchase of a quantity that was so enormous of wick saying that the soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick for the maneuvers of formation per year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnic ones of the army, which were contacted MF DNES, it is decided however that, in such a case, these maneuvers with frequent use of explosives should carry out also all the generals, officers of high command, and even secretaries and cleaners every year.
They did not want even the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek exempt.
Only like this could be justified that the army uses up sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length is equivalent to 25.000 explosions.
Although like this outside, the army would have sufficient existences for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as they say the experts, for the initial formation of every new professional it arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have sufficient existences with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) for the 225 ones indicated previously.
The soldiers of the brigade of fast intervention complained personally not long ago before the Minister Vondra because they say that they hardly have ammunition for different weapons, by what even the practices of shot are limited for question of money.
And let's not talk on the lack of underwear.
"I neither achievement to understand that they buy us repeatedly such quantities of wick."
"But it is its decision and, undoubtedly, they will know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer who, as company, we try to satisfy," the business manager of STV admits Group, Jan Dcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense Jan Pejsek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick saying also that it will have existences of this "ammunition" at least for ten years.
However, Jan Dcký, of STV Group, indicates that the wick so alone has an useful life of four years and, in the case of the pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If it is stored in some perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers that, for the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give its name.
After the ending of its useful life, every ammunition must be checked carefully to see whether it keeps being reliable and will not hamper the soldiers.
But these proofs are not free and require an additional inversion.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, he obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less that the order of the last year of 244 kilometers," indicates the spokesman Pejsek of the center of purchases of the Ministry of Defense.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of wick of the pyrotechnic ones of the police, who the ammunition of the Second World War or the one left by the Soviet army eliminate, does not surpass any longer since years ago the 1.500 meters.
Besides, the police always ask only for the just quantity as to use up the ammunition before its useful life finishes.
They decided it for reasons of safety for the pyrotechnic ones and more modern and more reliable types of wick can, besides, meanwhile be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition of the period of the Pact of Warsaw, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was prepared for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnic ones with which he spoke MF DNES, after a couple of years the following problem with the current one will take place: hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is being bought now "cheap," will have to be eliminated.
Until now I keep living of the contacts that I obtained thanks to the competition
The fact that it gained the competition "Businessman of the year" helped Lukás Pytloun in the sale of the exemptions of its hotel.
The the last edition, gained the competition "Businessman of the year" the enterprising one of 28 years Lukás Pytloun de Liberec.
Its success story seems taken out of a film.
Lukás Pytloun loved he traveling.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec accommodation of quality to good price was necessary.
With the savings that it brought together with seasonal works abroad and a loan of the bank it bought a home that was half demolished composed of five flats.
Taking that it still studied its third year at university into account, it was really brave.
"At present, the relation quality-price of the accommodation in our area gave me impulse to do something about this," says Lukás Pytloun.
He started to rent foreign workers the first reconstructed flat.
All the admissions that obtained it inverted them again in the building, that gradually converted in a guesthouse of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it managed little by little to open guesthouses, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all the categories of accommodation in Liberec four.
The most comfortable of all was, until not long ago, the hotel of design of four stars Pytloun.
However, this year he opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of exemption, and other people are showing interest in an exemption of Pytloun," the businessman said number one of the last year.
"To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped to a large extent" the fact that gains the competition of the 'Businessman of the year'," adds thankful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity in Liberec as well as in the surroundings.
"The people recognized me for the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, that it was very nice," remembers.
Undoubtedly, some company recommends all the world which he wants to try that she take part in the competition.
But considers that gaining is not necessary, but the participation already is beneficial.
It states that, up to the moment, he keeps living of the contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he had perhaps not obtained.
"With some people that I knew thanks to the competition I have usually started to collaborate."
The fame associated with the success, in its opinion, included likewise in the employees,
in total about seventy.
"Have given that they show a bigger loyalty and they are proud of the general recognition taking part in something that obtained."
"It is not, even a lot less, my own personal success, but is the result of the hard work of all the equipment."
"That it is only my name the one that appears in first page," says today modestly Lukás Pytloun.
I wish him my successor a year calmer than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria for the victory soon dissipated for the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst thing.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the competition of "Company" Vodafone "of the year," the year passed in the "Slavic Home" of Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which it managed to convert a small technical factory in eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not alone cheered up me to me, but to all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competence," says the winner of the last year.
The business history Farmet starts with the desire to make something useful.
That's why, when the State suggested the rent of a small factory as compensation for the embargo of estates during the communism to the father of Karel Žárský, he did not doubt too much; it renounced its post in the company in which worked and, with a couple of colleagues, they founded the company with its father of batteries of plastic.
Little afterwards, they started to specialize in presses of vegetable oil.
Eight years they converted in the oldest manufacturer of automatic presses of the center of Europe afterwards.
They obtained a bigger presence also among the public not specialized after reaching the success in the competition in the media.
"Not alone our customers started to consider to the brand Farmet as considerably better, but also the foreign members started to value the collaboration with a company that obtained a bigger success in its country," says Karel Žárský.
The year passed perhaps an exhibition of the euphoria of the victory was not alone in Farmet.
He obtained likewise recognition for the commercial results until 2008 and, partially, of the 2009.
And precisely 2009 it was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not reached to so many citizens yet, provoked that the companies stopped its capital projects and started to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, evidently, do not get rid of such a situation either."
"The admissions came down to 40%, we had to limit the production and we even had some dismissals," explains Karel Žárský.
A feasible company must adopt, on occasions, even little popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, even if it went at inferior levels that before the crisis.
In spite of everything, in where Farmet did not cut back expenses was in the R&D.
"With the subsidies we have built a center of research and formation, we reinforce the presence in the international market and we obtained magnificent appraisals in national fairs," says Žárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
The admissions increase again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement wait that it contributes a feeling of victory, but in a more soothed atmosphere," indicates Karel Žárský.
An enquiry that reveals the ridiculous norms
The enquiry of Absurdez of the year is part for the fourth time of the business competition.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the enquiry Absurdez of the year was the duty to take documents that the civil servants can enter in line to the administration.
More than one third of the almost four thousand voters adopted the decision.
For example, the administration of the social security asked for an extract of the business register, although its civil servants can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the enquiry, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of the social security any longer will not ask for an extract of the business register when it carries out a control of the impositions of the insured," the spokesman of SSZ Jana Buraová testified.
The goal of the enquiry Absurdez of the year consists in consulting the norms and regulation that the companies and businessmen in Czech Republic must respect and trying that those that are absurd are eliminated.
This year Hospodáské noviny is for the fourth time part of the business competition of the publication and it starts to create interest likewise among the general public.
Whereas the edition of the last year had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached the four thousand of them.
And not surprising result, since we still have several legal duties in excess that they must be respected simply to trade.
"In the first place perhaps in number of necessary papers for the income tax return we are worldwide," comments on Karel Havlíek de la Asociación of small and medium companies and of businessmen of the Czech Republic.
Since years ago, the simplification of the business norms is a goal declared of all the governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, eight posts are situated in the 74th position by Czech Republic, that is, worse than last year.
The competition Absurdez of the year was celebrated for the first time in 2006 and every year is repeated in the same way.
Any can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdez every year between April and ends of September, when the competition closes.
The proposals can be carried out on web page www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for the "antiprize" and, during October, he allows the public to vote in Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He gains the absurdez that receives more votes.
For the enquiry of this year more than a hundred were presented, particularly 105 norms and regulations that do not have felt.
Businessmen as well as professional associations and journalists sent the examples.
Among the "finalists" of the competition the requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of the roads and highways pay the toll or that the businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two baths paint was situated, for example, every two years the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The advertisement of the competition, which is always carried out to beginnings of November in the post of Wenceslao of Prague, is part of an event that personalities usually take in part of the political and social world.
For example, this year they attended this act of the competition Eva Svobodová, manageress of the Association of small and medium companies and of businessmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity can not be maintained if the State fetters it continuously the businessmen, because of that my goal consists in in eliminating every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that at present complicate unnecessarily the trade," announced the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not stay in water of borages.
In 2007, what bothered the people more was the duty to the businessman of communicating with an anticipation of three days to the business office of the area of permanent functioning, the intention of going with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This duty was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The duty that finished in second place in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the office of work on the part of its foreign workers of the journeys of work of until 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the called green card.
And to the third goes the beaten one.
The Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for the physiotherapists of having a big mirror in its consultation, a fridge and two scales of ground.
That's why, this year the Ministry of Health emitted a communication saying that it had eliminated the duty to have a fridge.
A new category recognizes the responsible companies socially
The ecological, humanitarian, educational or sport projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the competition of Hospodáské noviny is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition consists in backing the responsible and just companies up.
"This way we want to support to the companies that are in charge of the impact of its activity on the environment and that back up socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the competition of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of this year of the main competition of Vodafone Empresa of 2010 companies for which the commercial success is not the only long-term goal presented themselves.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between one and another, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that they offer.
In a case, it is for example about the disabled people, in others of the personal problems or of health of the employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of all the Republic the praguense company of software Et Netera, which backs up the formation of informal sport equipments among its workers, who afterwards take part in competitions of different sports, situated itself, for example.
Another example of company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has already been being seven years the main aportador of backgrounds to sponsor the disabled children.
In Podbrad, there is a stationery that sees especially to the problems of health of its workers, since they constitute more of 70% of the staff; that's why it received the bond of Company responsible for the central area of Czech Republic and in the competition Vodafone Empresa of the year finished in third place in the region.
In Olomouc gained Soft, who reduced the work schedule, even below the average of 35 weekly hours, without reducing the salaries, the company of accounting MiRyz.
They also granted the bond to him because he buys preferentially Czech manufacturers, backs the community activities up in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle what is maximum possible so that our production activities and administration cause the smallest possible impact in the environment," explains the businessman Miluse Ryznarová.
The responsible company of YOU Enlogit of the region of Ústí also thinks in the health of its employees and, with every mobile, it offered a chair and ergonomic keyboards to them; besides, it backs the work up from home and in its business events it uses the services of catering of a local protected company.
"Besides, we back up the grant Persona in predicaments, which helps specifically the local Romani community," comments on the representative of the company Ondej Suchý.
The company of laundry Praní to istní of the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive increases in a special way, that has effects on its pension funds is also situated in good place with a mention.
"We give profits in food, transport, improvement of the cualificaciones and leisure," says Josef Strapá, of the company of construction of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the region of Moravia-Silesia.
In the category of Company responsible for the year all the regional finalists of the competition Vodafone Empresa of the year that they answered to the questions of the form of inscription were designated automatically and they sent it before the 15th of August to the organizers.
The organizers eliminated the forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competitor companies did not answer the questions, they could not take part in the competition of Company responsible for the year, but do not remain disqualified of the "main" competition Vodafone Empresa of the year."
"The individual candidacies for this competition are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the main competition of Company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the consultancy Bison & Rose.
The police carried out arrests during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Background, in Pilsen
The police against the corruption carried out different arrests in the building of the Agricultural Background on the last days.
The detectives handcuffed a local businessman of the sector of the means and the property businessman Lubos G.
As it seems, this attempt to manipulate a public auction in progress for the restitution of the laws so that the auctioned ground received it one interested precise.
It had to pay it because of that To Lubos G. half a million of crowns.
"For the moment so alone I can say that the police look for a person for bribery during a public auction and competitive bidding," told the head of the attorney general of Pilsen Antonie Zelená to Právo, adding that for the moment it can not spread more details on the research in progress.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the businessman of 46 years.
On the mode in which it could be influential in the public auction, the little official information given, so alone people can speculate.
The spokesman of the Agricultural Background Lubomíra erná answered to the questions of Právo saying that the police carried out the arrest really in the headquarters of Pilsen and it was during a public auction.
It "is a customer, not of one of our workers," it needed.
According to erná, the public auction is called "Call for the presentation of proposals of transfer of grounds in accordance with the law on the earth" and is carried out when several parts shown interest in relation to the offered ground appear.
"These people, during the call, offer a value superior to that of its restitution, that it must be transferred that the value of the ground is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, afterwards, the Agricultural Background transfers the ground to the person that offers the biggest offer" explained the spokesman of the Background.
Lubos G. had information on whom it was going to be presented to the call and, since at the same time it is interested person because it acquired different laws of restitution, it suggested the ones interested in the ground that would not take part in the auction.
For such a favor, he kept charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the moment of the arrest, it had so much money above.
Lubos G. had special contacts in the Background of Pilsen already since some time ago.
Václav Sankot, who was accused because he dispatched the replacement of grounds for which a decision of construction had already been emitted, appeared in the cause of the former head of the PF.
For example, Lubos G. finishes of to obtain some grounds foreseen for the construction of public infrastructures, particularly in the place where a big road to the industrial zone of Borská pole should be built, from the Background.
Afterwards, it changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate through a home in the historic center of the city with a very superior value itself.
The town council had to take part, in this case, because, otherwise, the blocked grounds would prevent the construction.
The families will have to pay some additional expenses of several hundreds of crowns per month
The homes will have to pay, complements by heating and, in some cases, bigger rents, since January not alone for all the types of energy, but also for water and electricity.
Therefore, the families will have to take several more hundreds of crowns at the month out of the wallet, from January, than now.
The price of the electricity increases by 4,6%, the gas around of 2%, in some cities they will have to pay even 10% more for the water supply and many increase also the price of the central heating.
The rise of the electricity for the families that they live in apartments should rise at about 100 more crowns per year than now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced the prices, due to that has increasing the support to the production of energy of renewable fountains, particularly the photovoltaic one.
However, the price of the gas is brought up moderately, especially in the moment in which the heating is used more and, therefore, biggest it is the consumption.
In this case, they must also have one more couple of hundreds of crowns per year.
Whereas the electricity and the gas go up in price through all the country, the change of price of the central heating varies in a place to another.
The biggest municipality mainly plans the rise in prices.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or of Hradec Králové will pay since January by the central heating the month about 50 crowns more, whereas the families of Liberec will pay more than 1.000 crowns additional to the year.
The residents in Prague will also have to stand an increase of 9% of the price of the water and the heating, especially in the event of the city increasing the rent of the infrastructures.
If the rent does not vary, the praguenses will pay 6,8% additional.
The prices in Prague, will however keep being among the lowest of all the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, will be brought up by both rates the price of 7,4%.
They can increase considerably the prices of the rent of 450.000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which Labem has about 2.500 flats in Ústí nad, will increase the rent from January in up to one 100%.
The company will take the courts to those who do not agree with the new rent.
The regulated rents, which benefit to the residents of about 300.000 flats, could increase the year that comes even 10%.
The Czech youngsters get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is not of mode any longer, because it does effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from its fathers.
Those are the drinks that provoke that young drinkers finish in neat doctors with an age inferior to fifteen years.
The children that they finish knocked down in hospital continuously already to surpass the hangover are not an exception.
This derives from the experience of the doctors that they meet with such cases in the admissions of pediatrics of the hospital.
"Drinking beer or wine any longer is not in fashion, because it takes them a lot to get them drunk."
"Now the fashion are the strong alcoholic drinks," indicates To Právo the head of pediatrics of the Hospital Hoovice in the center of Bohemia, Ludk Pelikán.
"When they manage to catch it a bottle to its father of the cupboard, it can be whiskey, but normally they are Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of which it is lightened with juice and of which it does not smell so much," explains.
Also the spokesman of the university Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová, confirms it.
"Normally," they "are usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are the modern alcoholic drinks, particularly among the schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use liquor that caught at home," adds Jurinová.
According to the head Pelikán, they are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years those that tend appear in hospitals.
Before Hoovice, where he works since this year, he worked during a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances took the youngsters from the near areas.
"A girl had to deposit perhaps four times."
"It started at the twelve years, when they brought it with 3,5 of alcohol in blood, besides a mixture with ecstasy," it indicates the doctor of the department on this case.
"It was in the fair of Holesovice in some holiday of dance."
"What is interesting is that to its mother not even it surprised it that its daughter disappeared 48 hours," the head is surprised.
The one that is considered the main cause of the increase of the consumption of alcohol among the youngsters is precisely the lack of interest of the fathers or even its clear tolerance towards the drink on the part of its children.
The experts indicate that, in the case of the children, it can not be spoken properly of dependence.
"It is understood by alcoholic to a person that has a chronic dependence from the alcohol since several years ago, with all the phenomena associated to it, which is not produced in children."
"In those that drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather owed of a systematically unsuccessful social or familiar environment," explains the head Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric private hospital of Motol forty inebriated children were hospitalized until mid November.
However, the statistics only show the ones that go with a severe intoxication and must remain in hospital.
The young drinkers, do not count who, after the mobile medical examination, go home with the fathers or with the police.
Besides the cases in which the children simply meet after the school and drink liquor up, for Pelikán there are three seasonal up and downs which one may mention: the day of witches, End of Year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have gotten to see inebriated children up to seven in admissions at the same time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who pass the night in disintoxication under the monitoring of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the day after they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, provoked by the dehydration and the lack of glucose, is prevented with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the organism lacks.
"These take it much better, because after the shaken night, they are lifted well and it does not hurt them at all."
They are only shown confusing with regard to where are," indicates Pelikán, adding that, often, the patients lose the good humor at least when they see the expenses that have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospitalization in a room for severe patients gets to cost ten thousands of crowns.
"Often I have used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I say them directly to the children how much has cost its drunkenness and that they should pass all the summer in a work for youngsters so that you gained enough to be paid that night," adds Pelikán.
The medical insurance, in its opinion perhaps as regressive measure, which usually returns it to the people the expenses of the treatment, does not make it in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 airplanes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 airplanes of a total of five, for those that the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the airplane Casa C-295 M, set off on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the airships Casa - EADS. is
It is the first time that a device of this type is found in the hands of somebody that it is not the Czech army.
For the moment, they were only abroad to carry out flights of practices or of demonstration.
It is about the two-seater version L-159 T 1, that up to the moment it used the Czech army and that it was still in a state of to fly.
The three remaining airplanes are the monoplaza L-159.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already saw about them last week.
Jan Pejesk, of the department of press of defense, indicates that it is not known yet when the airplanes will retire physically of Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seater airplanes, however, were separated from the airplanes repaired some time ago, without inversions nor additional contributions on the part of the Ministry."
"The two-seater ones L-159 T 1 were exchanged in its current state," said Právo Pejsek.
He added that the army does not stay without two-seater airplanes, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new airplanes already received it the army in July, the other one will be delivered at the end of year.
According to Pejsek, EADS committed itself to the airplanes being added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the contract it is indicated clearly that the company EADS is the one that withdraws the L-159 airplanes and that will serve for the practices of pilots of countries of the NATO."
"Therefore, his deciding how it is going to use them in this frame depends on the buyer," indicates Pejsek.
The newspaper Hospodáské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for an airplane Casa and the purchase of another three airships for 3.500 million crowns were approved the year passed by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call for a bid for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current address of defense states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired to Aer 72 airships and so alone uses 24, for what wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of airplanes Casa possibly gets to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defense before the European Court of Justice because she should choose the airplanes carrying out a European bid and not contacting itself with only one manufacturer.
The army already received three airplanes Casa and the last one should arrive to the praguense airport of Kbely on fourteen days.
A forefinger longer than the ring-shaped one indicates a lower risk to suffer cancer
The men who have the index longer than the ring-shaped one are subject to a smaller risk to suffer cancer of prostate.
This is the surprising conclusion of one studied published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It would be able depend of the level of testosterone, the masculine hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can constitute a simple proof of the risk to suffer cancer of prostate, particularly for the men with ages of until 60 years," the coauthor of the study indicated Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for the research on the cancer in the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be submitted to a proof of cancer of prostate, particularly if this characteristic is associated to a genetic risk or other harmful factors, as familiar problems of health, as it indicates Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he carried out the follow-up with a British counterpart of more than 1.500 patients with cancer of prostate and, simultaneously, of 3.000 healthy men.
More of half of the participants in the study had the finger Indian of the right hand shorter than the ring-shaped one.
They presented the same probabilities of suffering cancer of prostate as 19% of those whose fingers they were of the same length.
In the case of the men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk came down to 33%; for the men with inferior ages at 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relation between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones at which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A level of inferior testosterone corresponds with a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that the testosterone is influential in the development of the cancer of prostate.
The big Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, the professor Václav Paes, told To TK that it knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relation between the length of the fingers and the cancer can "be proved completely."
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and the D5 are closed
Czech Republic, as the majority of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered of snow.
The roads and sidewalks are covered by compact snow mainly and the quitanieve machines circulated all the night through numerous areas.
In the morning it was the road D5 closed between the kilometers 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourisms, as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The operator of the Ústedního automotoklubu (ÚAMK) transmitted the news.
In the kilometer 91 a truck was broken, in the 93 two industrial vehicles that provoked wounded were startling.
Also several tourisms finished in the ditch.
There are likewise problems in the road D1 in the kilometer 185 towards Prague.
There two trucks were startling.
The drivers must circulate slowly after Brno in the kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join the kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
There jams of several kilometers have been formed.
An accident has also been produced on D11 road, exactly beside Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7th C.
Jams for example in Prosek are being formed, although Štrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the meter.
The tramways circulate with delay, for example in the line among Karlovo námstí and Námstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will take place in Prague.
The problems affect likewise the railroads and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech company of railroads had to nullify seven connections for three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
The travellers should prove which is the current situation.
The airport Ruzyn closed since eleven in the night of Wednesday up to five in the morning.
At present, it can already be circulated for most of the roads of the south of Moravia, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyskovska they are closed to the circulation three secondary roads, in Brnnska languages of snow are being formed and in Blanenska chains to access specific access roads to the highest points are needed.
One of the most affected places was Vyskovsko.
Up to the moment the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kuerov and also Šaratice - Milesovice.
To clear them drills will be required.
For the moment it can not be said when they will open out to the circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Cárpatos).
Centimeters of snow up to five are accumulated, by the roads of the region that, since it is a protected natural area, they must simply forget in inert state, as it indicates TK.
In Czech Republic between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, fell where the layer of snow reaches the 18 centimeters.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowstorms diminish gradually in Czech Republic.
The American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, once XM-25 has only been known for the moment by the coded name.
The generals expect the new rifle to be influential in the local conflict with Taliban and that "it changes the progress of the game" made its victory.
The new weapons are as a small pistol and with an aiming extremely precise.
Its bales go off with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special ammunition of caliber of 25 mm created for this rifle and the high burden of explosives that it contains provokes that in fact it works as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed so that they explode not only when they knock to the goal, but in any point that finds in its ballistic curve.
They can be used against the enemies who hide after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, a normal protection can not be used and, when it launches its murderous rain of metallic splinters, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who talked on the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry who uses an "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it so that they find the goal, note to it its laser beam, which determines the distance, afterwards obtains a precise point of sight and, according to it, corrects the line of projection and tightens the trigger."
"We say that 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon loads up and "it launches the projectile to a distance from 543 meters, more except one, two or three meters," it indicates Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The consortium Fujitsu transfers its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change its working place of its previous office block into the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu transfers its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he communicated the giant of the sector specialized in computers and its maintenance Wednesday, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of the following year of its previous office block in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park, a great complex of offices on Lyoner Straße street in the neighborhood of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A spokesman of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term some other 100 employees of the consortium, which previously they found disseminated through the region, will be lodged there.
The offer is highly attractive, besides the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way of working of the employees.
Besides, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner stated, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central site with an excellent infrastructure."
The shining connection with the airport is very important at present for a global company as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region provoked yesterday joy among those that were plus and disappointment among which they were against.
The head of section of economics of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) stated that with that it has gotten round a "Global Player."
This is a "magnificent recognition to the site."
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The greens) complains about the decision of Fujitsu.
The address informed before to the city on its intention.
"Naturally we have offered our company help," declared Korwisi.
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the estate in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic motifs producieron the fall.
In such a way, there is now a big empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I expect the owner and the hirer of the building to be shown cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" were part with the surplus buildings of Marienbader Platz since ten years of a controversial seaside building project of the city ago.
As joint project of the city and of a private enterprise of projects between the station and the town council a new entry to the city, which is put in charge of the criticism as for the massive construction that previously used the hollows as posts of parking place and as for the level of the buildings, is formed.
In 2001 the manufacturer of Software has been installed by the department of inversion and companies of appraisal for systems of reservations, Start Amadeus, as well as manufacturer of computers Fujitsu then joined Siemens to the home.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the property group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later Falcon Real Estate Investments SA resold to the Spanish in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, native of Tokyo, is recognized as the third oldest world supplier of YOU.
It has companies, for example of computers and servants, and gives also the precise services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the biggest in Germany, anyway Fujitsu counts on more businesses in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
7.000 square meters have been rented by that in the office block of Astro Park.
The old complex of the twenties, its name refers to its plan with form of star, lodges among others to the central association of electrotechnology and to the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the servant - Threats against Assange
The anguish takes hold of Wikileaks every time more.
The supplier of services of internet Amazon has eliminated the platform of revelations of its servant.
Possibly political pressure is behind after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is apparently thorough in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the white of the criticisms, always more forts in the United States.
The activists of internet lost the access to its previous American servant and at present look for a homeland of internet in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who he meets in the list of people looked for of Interpol, must remain arrested in Big Brittany, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the servant of Amazon."
"Talking freely in the country of the freedom," communicated the activists of the revelations through the service of messaging Twitter Wednesday (local time).
Little before, the company of internet, Amazon, had eliminated the documents of Wikileaks of its servant.
The activists of internet had recurred to the web of services Amazon in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to be able to face the high ciphers of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, our dollars will be destined to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with the freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servant through Wikileaks, after an employee of the senator Joe Lieberman had requested researches, informed the chain CNN according to a call to the office of Lieberman.
The presidency of the board of the senate for the safety of the country had threatened to Amazon with boycott, informed the British "Guardian."
"It had wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks," the senator testified.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also forbade the use of the servant in other countries.
"The process illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate of Wikileaks puts our national safety in game and threatens the life in the world," was stated in a communique of the independent senator.
"No responsible company, either jacket or foreigner, must help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is searched in Sweden by suspicion about rape, is in the list of people looked for of Interpol.
According to an article of the from London newspaper "The Independent," the Australian of 39 years is found thorough in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The activist of internet has qualified constantly the research in Sweden as a plot of its enemy.
The spokesman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, stated in London that there have been threats.
There were even calls on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why the safety of Assange is feared, stated Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks keeps not being revealed.
Hrafnsson reacted evidently in the face of the declarations of North America.
In America, the previous republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the one responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks must be judged by treason and must be executed.
In Canada, stated an adviser of the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange should "be murdered" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White Home and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American president Barack Obama, qualified as "ridicule and absurdity" that Assange has asked the resignation of the secretary of state, if she is responsible of ordering recently diplomats who got involved in tasks of espionage.
"I am not in a complete way sure why it must import us the opinion of a type with a web page," declared Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its web page."
The American government has to prove the efficiency of the protection of its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy manager of distribution of the National Center against the terrorism, was named exceptional foreman, announced the White Home.
For what Travers is responsible of developing "the important structural reforms," which are necessary in the light of the filtration of Wikileaks.
The White Home also wants to inspect the paths, as well as to change the total information on the government and to protect it.
Besides, the American government announced that to be in charge of the safety of the dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to contact us with them," stated the spokesman of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if it were necessary."
The university of the ice cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bologne heladeros are prepared in the best periods of the year.
The basic course of three days for future heladeros has the maximum flow and visitors of all the world.
In fact of where all the ice cream comes?
Of the gelatiere and of the gelataio.
The gelatiere elaborates the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the elaboration of ice cream.
The gelataio takes the cream of the ice cream of the counter with a spatula, extends it on the cookie and sells it.
To know this, Anzola dell'Emilia is not needed to go to in the province of Bologne.
But the one who wants to know more on ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped to the university of the ice cream with the congeladora one in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of its machines complies the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future heladeros has the maximum flow and visitors of all the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on the ice cream of chocolate and practices in the ice-cream shop of the home itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream its vague desires.
This time are 40 participants of 19 countries of all the continents, from Brazil up to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art of California, loves the slow movement of the food and in the future she wants to offer a European product of quality in the earth of the industrial ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is an advisor of companies and wants to create something own in some years in an enervante work.
Two Egyptian youngsters dream to open an ice-cream shop in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another of Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream of its bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because its children love the Italian ice cream.
The teacher heladero Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream to the participants later.
It is not decisive alone its good taste, but also its silky smoothness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget its formation or the cover of whipped cream of the national superior home and mainly of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has a little romantic."
The first crossing to the elaboration seems facilísimo.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, whipped cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a big blender, that warms up, everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and to the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Afterwards he opens the faucet of the machine and a white basic cream comes out, the base for all the types of ice cream of milk, pasteurized.
Suddenly, the professor asks: The cream of ice cream can be elaborated alone with elements natural or without estabalizador?
How can loose rein to any desires of experimenting be given?
Luciano advises that they get muddled up of the trends of the period.
The one that talks of ice cream "not alone of natural ingredients," maybe has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course that it can be elaborated frozen without stabilizer, only it has to be bought it a day, to place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound ice cream of granite.
Certain variances are allowed in the basic mass.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, the teacher Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients those that they buy to themselves in the section of fruit or in that of candies of the supermarket.
Ademas, there are powders and pastes.
"All the suppliers will try to strain ingredients aromatized in its merchandise."
"However they must experiment sometimes."
Be already with sherbets of fruit with sugar and fresh fruits.
O even with the cream of ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will be returned a cream yellow and with powdered cocoa as it bases for all the possible pleasures of the chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the ice-cream freezers.
Luciano lets them elaborate every time four types different from ice cream of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They carry out the same experiment also with types of ice cream of fruit.
He knowing better does not depend necessarily on his having more aroma of tofe or more puree of fruits.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of hazelnuts knows to dried fruit, whether it contains more hazelnuts.
The work group elaborates the adored ice cream of kiwi, which uses more fruits, less water and something less of stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of the ice cream, states Luciano.
The elaboration of ice cream is a problem of artimética: The puree of peach with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe has to be reduced.
For the ice cream of lemon an extra portion of sugar is necessary.
Luciano takes a utensil with which it fixes the quantity of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winegrower for Oechsle in the grape juice of grape).
Fortunately the boards facilitate the account.
Elaborating ice cream does not require more than the physical application, as before.
Not alone help the utensil for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared mixture of ice cream is beaten simultaneously and gets cold at temperature under zero.
In spite of everything, all the automation stays outside as for the small paste.
The Brazilian Gustavo is marked to itself and to its colleagues above to down with puree of fruits, as if it were a gigantic miniprimer without control.
"In all the courses," it states the teacher Luciano, "a question of time that passes a little like this is alone."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European authority of safety of the foods Efsa has infiltrated into the industry that she experiences with transgenic plants.
At present the group of experts Testbiotech, who considers himself an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of the biotechnology, formulates this matter.
"Seems a theory of conspiracy but have not documented it well," stated Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts of Efsa on genetically modified plants, and another expert of Efsa are also hired since years ago in the association Ilsi.
The consortiums as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the controls of Efsa of genetically modified plants, which situates it in a clear clash of interests, criticizes Then.
The arrangements of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which in fact is controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, a manager of high range of Efsa was not long ago without the support nor the transitional time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed its edict with that.
Not long ago, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections among the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, that they carried out the Medicinal General of the Environment as well as a parliamentary clairvoyant of the EU.
However, Efsa can not recognize any clash of interests.
All the formal data, also to some of the industry is recurred, as long as they are of a high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
It is not required from the experts who work in Efsa who do not have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits its work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in USA.
It is named to itself as a neutral forum for the experts and the science, the industry and the policy, among others for the risk appraisal for the biotechnology without the assignment of Lobby.
In this subject, independent experts, as Then, criticize at present transgenic plants being allowed without investigating the food for the animals and the influence of the plants genetically modified in the environment not being checked.
"We want to know what, for example, does the genetically modified corn in the agriculture," states Then.
The current practice consists in verifying isolated unicamente proteinas, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not looked for, how they are going to be found?" question, complainant, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck gives an opinion in the same way.
The scientist investigates since 1994 the field of the genetic engineering and at present works in the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry tries every time more, in USA. and in Europe, to influence or to discredit the critical scientists.
That's why, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For the companies, the critical studies are normally not published.
"The industry controls the research of the safety," maintains Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has obtained some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday it was in the face of the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba to the backs.
There were demonstrations
It snowed.
The history is known: In September the diggers arrived and they started to bring down a big bit of the north wing.
The earth of Stuttgart was never it again: Thousands and thousands appeared against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing itself hizó rubbles.
It rotates in 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, lifted between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, has 43 years.
A couple of bits has been guaranteed.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he said once, the smoke of the cigarettes has smelt.
He does not know yet what he will make with the bits.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trace of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous deposit of ammunitions of the French Fleet, where Manuel Rongen erected its stone Stein-Reich.
The man of 44 trade years with old stones.
He has bought all what results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or would send it to the garbage man," states in its office, a wooden casita that once was a stall of guard.
They insulted it and threatened, explains, when, in September, it appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remains of the north wing to the company of demolitions.
The talked with the enemies of the 21 SEC during several days.
And it explained to them that it could absolutely not make anything for the demolition.
And when it happened, then that was the most reasonable thing, when the stones kept being used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the mazizo of 80 kilos cut, with a price for bit of 6,50 at 14 euros.
Some took it as memory but also with the expectation to be able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a burden of 25 trucks.
Approximately the half is still in the forest, the rest some time ago that it was sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, person in charge of projects.
They arrived from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse some time ago that has turned into "the wall" or into the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact this stone is not at all special," states Rongen.
"If it were not for the political component."
It rises to its jeep, does a tour for its big kingdom of 20 hectares.
It studied right, interrupted its studies, and later biology, the computers are it interesting and finally works with stones.
And he is a lover of the stones.
It houses 4.000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures through all Germany.
He makes out that he is the oldest tratante of old stones of the country.
He stops.
In the snow there are artistic stones of sandstone pricked.
"Pertencieron to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," explains.
Yellow dawn limestone, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The path crosses the forest.
It indicates a heap: Red sandstone, a previous bit of the station of Karlsruhe.
And it continues.
"Pretty travertino."
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the platform of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and histories, yellow travertino of the headquarters of police of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, tufa of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks in as it sculpted before the stones and moved them with a simplex tackle and a wagon, is felt very devout.
It would "be a scandal if something were destroyed."
It has not been done rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave that to do to the tratante of stones, besides stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glazier and a gardener have been installed above in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," states the man that is in charge of making use of the remains.
In little it has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fight of talents around great potentials
An active flow reigns in the buffet.
16 students crowd together around the rolls, the soup of tomato and the candies.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited to a factory to the students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a sort of competition of ideas, they have to talk on the car of the future with the workers of VW and besides learn everything on Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way as VW, infighting is brought together in a fight, by many companies, around the minds most privileged in collaborations with the universities.
Its mission: Hiring as soon as possible the pupils with more talent of the universities, that they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And as the universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of its students, it is tried to glimpse to the exceptional talents in practical projects and to collect them.
The second day of project in the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium is gained to the talents.
A lady of the personnel department divides up pens, gomitas and folders with the logo of VW.
It explains the programs of practices and the works for students to the thrilled young talents and shows them its paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle de la Universidad Técnica de Braunschweig takes the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parts: "The students get in contact with the industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can know the students, to observe more of near the interesting candidates and to consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not little common.
The novelty is in that the students are wanted so directly.
"The principal point previously was in the technical projects," states Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is turning harder.
In many branches, the companies can not choose its employees any longer among a great group of applicants.
If not that they have to be announced and, especially, to obtain a highly qualified manpower.
All the students of the disciplines of engineering are in an excellent situation of negotiation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its initials in German), in October there were 40.000 posts of vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognostics of the VDI, this emptiness of engineers will still grow more.
In the company of auditory one and advice, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the hunt of talents.
It organizes costly events of recruitment, as the career KPMG, a type of modern yincana, in which the participants have to find its path through the coordinated ones of the GPS.
The company wants to send to eight very promising students to USA. the following year.
Besides the participants can observe the subsidiaries of KPMG and learn on the company.
It is decided who must go in two rounds of choice in the exit.
Alone the crème de la crème of many participants goes to USA.
The universities strive every time more to choose and to polish to the high potentials of the universities, according to Dykta.
"With the career we want to stand out of the mass."
"The simple stretch by itself alone was kept us short."
For the headhunter Dykta the notes give results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are near its end, and they want to request to work with us," states.
Besides the direct approach in the campus, they are also to the hunt, especially, the small and medium companies, classic with its fairs of the work.
"We try to obtain students in the specialized fairs."
"A little on Intersite," states Sitha Stübe, person in charge of staff for the manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld.
The company Bonner has approximately 1.500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue of the new generation.
At present in the web page of the company 35 vacant posts appear.
"It is being very complicated to fill up the vacant posts."
"Costs a lot of time and money," states.
A shorter path is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several high schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that practices with us can be done or carry out its theses.
Advertising campaigns faces are not carried out for the solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal atmosphere, llana hierarchy and convenient communication.
"A big consortium normally it can not offer it," declares Stübe, the person in charge of staff.
In the search of an employment, the money is not the most important thing any longer.
The decisive factors are flexible schedules of work, assistance to children or good possibilities of rise.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld exhibits the post 55 among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute elaborates an annual list of the best German suppliers of employment.
For what he asks the employee the satisfied one that is with the work and with the atmosphere in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the person in charge of staff also waits for points extra in its classification for its candidates to work.
"I think that the applicant is fixed especially in the external classifications of a potential employer," states.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler de la Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie recommends a good fame as employers to the companies that want a long-term strategy that they earn.
It recommends more authenticity to its customers.
And that means, according to Kriegler, internal measures, especially.
"The best path to be made attractive as employer passes for the employees themselves," assures.
In the jargon of the sector Employer Branding is called intern, also promotion of corporate identity in the staff herself.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When the people are treated well and identify it with the company, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer on the part of friends and acquaintances.
It "is as a game with gang," states Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil perforations
From the coast of the American state of Flowery to the Gulf of Méjico has not appeared in these years no new oil perforation.
The government of Washington emitted a strong prohibition and with that it nullified its previous plans in an unappealable way.
Perforations forbidden for the moment also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new.
This announced the minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What provoked this strict prohibition, which at least will be current the following five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the life to eleven workers and provoked the biggest environmental catastrophe of the US., the president Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the west part of the gulf of Méjico under pressure of the opposition and of the industry.
The partisans wanted like this to decrease the dependence of USA. of new supplies of oil of the foreigner.
Until today it has not been clarified in a complete way of who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the gulf.
In the center of the criticism she finds the British energetic consortium BP, which is confronted with millions of demands.
A commission of investigation ordered by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, lifted the moratorium of perforation after the explosion.
Later, different peteroleros consortiums presented applications for new attempts at perforation.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe using some harder controls and some stricter security rules.
At present the responsible supervising authority, which after having been accused of charges of corruption has fallen in disrepute, is reformed by its roots.
Obama announces parallelly that the lucrative tax loopholes will close for the consortiums of the oil and of the gas.
The industry announces publicly that the total extraction in the gulf will be smaller thanks to a stricter regulation, up to the date.
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the industries of the oil and of the gas," says the result of the current survey carried out by the advisory company BDO - before the prohibition of extraction of Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
The inversions in new projects of extraction go on for a start, to the detriment of the growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil márrón, smells as a gasstation: Millions of liters poured of crude oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogonilandia.
The people live of the theft, the corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
It seems well to Celestine Akpobari.
You do not "get" tired, the environmental activist calms down the journalists: "Today it will pass sufficient oil in front of your eyes."
The Nigerian of 37 years has managed to photograph boys wading in the water even across the breast with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences in the surface: With the brightness coloring of the water, the scene seems almost pretty.
It is not seen that on the surface brown stains of oil float.
Before here it caught prawns at handfuls, explains Esther Badom in the edge of the river Bodo-Jetty.
While, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive quantity of oil was poured into the formidable swamp for a broken pipeline.
The fish of the surroundings of the small city of Bodo had to swim six hours to arrive to high waters of fish: Which, in the heart of the delta of the Niger and situated in Ogonilandia, is considered as one of the regions more stunk of the world.
In the path of the tour of the river that he passes through mangrove swamps, the large desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the boat mixes up a brown broth, the one who submerges its hand in the water, will take some full of oil.
The raices of the trees of the mangrove swamps are raised from the ground as dark sticks of licorice, sadly aislan the palm trees that crash and hang its palms.
In vain flocks of birds are looked for, as if they were in the swamp as always: As soon as the barrier of the exterior is silenced, a sort of ghostlike calm of a previous paradise with smell expands in it to gasstation.
"What happens here is an ecological fight," states, unsociable, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for the health."
The warlike comparison proceeds.
The area of the settlement of the ogoni is a tough battlefield since years ago: Here the first European explorers broke more than 60 years ago, here the first endurance was organized in the eighties with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, more late executed, here the consortium Shell in 1993 had to place its first factory, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of the oil.
Still nowadays it is the return of the companies forbidden to Ogonilandia: While they pumped daily more than two a million barrels of black gold of all the region of the delta, of a size three times bigger that Switzerland, with more than 5.000 fountains of extraction and 7.000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were calm, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters stood out platforms of steel as eccentric sculptures of the water: "Arbolitos of Christmas" they called affectionately to the heads of the punches.
They have until 50 years, the majority presents a total corrosion.
To every instant it fails a head, gives an opinion Akpobari, then a constant jet of oil flows in the water.
According to the appraisals of the experts, more than two thousand a million liters have been poured in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the quantity of oil penetrates, as in the averia of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years in the sea of Alaska, one of the biggest ecólogicas catastrophes of the history of the humanity, ago.
The one who is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region, will fight with that.
Whereas the consortium of Shell and the organized thefts of oil are responsible for more of 90 per cent of the pollution, the ecologists see to the heads to point of being broken and to the pipelines with escapes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly standard basses of safety normally in the world the conventional ones, reproached the scientist Richard Steiner the consortium in 2008: Only the indexes of blemishes of the pipelines are "bigger on a multiple than in another place."
In a place, which from far seems forgotten, a factory full of oil appears under the free sky, figures of among the mangrove swamps rise up: They are naked and covered of oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which sometimes are joined to the perforations, sometimes spread arbitrarily on the ground, flambees a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is warmed up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
In the first place, the gasoline penetrates through the pipelines in the container, later the pipeline of oil drips and finalemente goes out diesel.
Of this way, Michael and four employees they produce daily barrels of diesel of 300 liters up to four: "It contributes us 34.000 naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta make use of the shortage of fuel in one of the biggest oil states of the black Africa.
Nigeria alone account with only one refineria.
With the absurd and cheap price of the diesel of hardly 40 euros-cent per liter the illegal heaters can still offer less: Like this they reduce the value of its raw material.
It originates from those of the bunkers," which did up the net of pipelines across which Ogonilandia goes: According to the experts, to this crossing 16 million liters of oil are lost at least to the day in all the delta of the Niger.
Only one insignificant part of the material one stored provisional premium is refined clearly illegally: The organized criminal nets, which politicians and military senior officials also belong to, put the best part away in cisterns and sell it cheap in the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely the debate academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the handling of the population or to the loose way of production rather.
"If the oil industries did not behave as invaders and they had not destroyed the natural habitat of the fish completely, there would not be sabotage, or thefts, nor illegal refinerias."
Whereas the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed especially by Shell up to the point that alone appears a deduction from the consortium: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, as the Chinese."
Michael is gotten nervous.
"It already keeps being hour that you disappear," says the brawny Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches to the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arresting them, if not with a painful bribery.
The soldiers proceeding from the north also want, as all the Nigerians, to benefit from the raw material.
"This condemned invention has shattered completely to our country," states Akpobari.
The investigators detect dangerous blemishes of factory in the engines of the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a great problem of safety.
In a research of a machine that carried out an emergency landing, the investigators found a possible blemish of factory, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of the engine.
The passengers of the Airbus de Qantas who carried out an emergency landing at the beginning of November had much more luck than the one that he can imagine did: The Australian authorities of air safety perceived a great problem of safety thanks to its researches in the engines of some A380, and they warn of a possible blemish of factory.
The potential blemish has complicated repercussions: In a connection of sleeves, fissures can be caused for fatigue or cracks, announced the authorities of the ATSB in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines fabricated by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 airplanes of the series A380.
Among which he finds the Qantas-Airbus that had to carry out an emergency landing on the 4th of November in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal averages against the British manufacturer of turbines.
He presented a demand in the federal court of Sidney that made more legal measures possible against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, declared that its airline will claim a compensation for the incident of beginnings of November.
In the brand of the engine they have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of the gasoline as the cause of the damages.
After the incident, engines of all the world up to 40 have to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry out more proofs of safety to the endowed superjumbos with the affected engines.
The recommendation of safety is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, stated Martin Dolan, spokesman of ATSB.
The problem of safety has been converted in important enough as to inform all the affected ones.
After the emergency landing of the device of Qantas, the airline maintained to its fleet A380 in earth during many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained three of its eleven A380 approximately in a temporary way in earth.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of a A380 as measure of precaution.
This airplane with double cover is the biggest airplane of passengers of the world.
A Snowstorm in all the country provokes the chaos in the traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost in all the country.
In many streets the chaos reigns, the trains and the airplanes fail.
At least three people have lost the life in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: Almost in all the country icy temperatures during the night of Thursday were reached, which has triggered off the chaos in the traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and of the east, there is a layer of snow of 15 centimeters of thickness.
The traffic is very limited in the majority of highways and in many streets.
In the A7 at the level of Flensburg, the snowplough are in continuous functioning, removing the new snow one and again, but is not prepared.
Besides, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic sea.
The Maritime and Hydrographic Federal Agency of Germany (BSH) waits for alive tides with the water level 1,2 meters above its usual level in the coast of the Baltic sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems in the highways and in the national highways.
As, the red alert is called for by the weather service Meteomedia in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are ordered of to swirl it.
There many trucks and cars remained caught during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities notified important disorders in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and the wind they paralyzed the traffic and created jams.
In Turingia the snowstorms affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, Turingia are waited by great disorders in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, and in the north of Baviera.
The snow in the road, the trees fallen on the lanes or the destroyed overhead power cable and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service of Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia a train HOISTS had that to stop its journey to Munich.
The firemen and the service of rescue attended to the 165 passengers in the train with blankets of wool, eaten and drunk.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
In the biggest German airport, the winds with snow provoked numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman of the headquarters of information of flights, in Munich some cancellations have already been announced.
In am Frankfurt Main, according to a spokesman of Fraport there are already 40 canceled flights.
The snowplough are in continuous functioning.
However, there are few passengers beached in the airport, in spite of that there are 400 prepared beds of campaign for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday in the afternoon already there was many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train in a cross of way in Ostholstein.
The engine driver suffered slight wounds.
In the nearness of Nuremberg snowstorms were caused by a similar accident because of the streets: Also here a truck was reached in a cross of ways because the vehicle remained barred.
The driver lost the life.
In the train four passengers were wounded, the tour of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked by this motif in the morning.
Besides a woman of 30 years died, after giving an overturn with its car near Aschaffenburg in a slippery road.
The weather forecasters have a good news: The snow will be more and more soft and dust type and it will therefore swirl in soft gusts.
But the wind will decrease.
Alone the Baltic sea will be seen affected by strong and fast winds.
Undoubtedly he will keep doing a lot of cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution looks for buyer for its towers of offices in its headquarters of Frankfurt.
The estate could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank fixed its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the neighborhood of the banks of Frankfurt; while the bankers returned to its former working place.
But now the financial consortium wants in appearance to benefit the costs of the reonvación, and search a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as it states the "Financial Times Deutschland" being based in a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the motifs of the sale in project.
We always check if it is convenient to have the estates or to sell them and next to rent them again," stated.
That's why the biggest credit institution of Germany renounces the headquarters of its company again after a short period of time.
The bank purchased the twin towers in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros of the investor of a background of the home and next carried out the pertinent hotfixes for him.
The energetic reforms reached some ciphers of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
The experts of this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the buildings renewed in a background of the bank are sold or it has not been revealed to an independent investor at present, he stated the spokesman.
Thousands of people of mourning for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10.000 people thought in the buried miners, who considered themselves deceased after many explosions in a mine.
Todavia have not been able to find the corpses, because the safety measures keep being precarious in the place of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the mine Pike River near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners of ages between 17 and 62 years remained buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of the misfortune, but it did not discover any signal of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no equipment of rescue could go down for motifs of safety.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts they deduced that there were not possibilities of the miners having survived.
The bodies have not been able to recover up to the date.
At present the relatives and friends remember the ones deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten a thousand people have changed with the shining brightness of the sun in Greymouth in the island New Zealander of the south.
They keep silence for two minutes.
In tribute of the buried miners, 29 tables with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners were placed.
There were also photographs and personal objects, below garments and surfboards.
The flags waved at half mast in front of the governmental buildings of the country.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," told John Key, the prime minister from New Zealand, to the participants of the commemorative act.
"But they never returned home."
The death of its son can not assume even that it has not seen its body, stated Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Beside the prime minister and to the relatives of the casualties took part in the commemorative act many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion on the 19th of November miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
The workers of rescue started by extinguishing a fire in the interior of the mine of coal in the island of the south of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the scorching temperatures of the interior of the mine will start to go down, declared Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, to the journalists.
To the devil, warlike!
Does the gore fit in the artistic cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the borders of the gender again with its epic of battles "Walhalla Rising."
In which public will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought as "Walhalla Rising" filmed?
An imprisoning viking warrior with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released of its torturers and murderer to its enemies with almost superhuman fights, plays ideal for young spectators that look for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes it to use brutal methods to kill and to extract the guts of its bodies from its enemies with life when it is of bad humor.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is called in fact, does not say almost any word during all the film and the other characters are let take for at the most one or two sentences or a couple of distressing mortal shouts.
Otherwise are silenced and they take pleasure of the pretty and terrifying montuosos landscapes of Scotland, which the frames offer to the world Viking of approximately a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for movie directors full-grown and interested in the existentialism and in movements of cameraman very soothed.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a sentence that they can not be discarded mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers its savages and to the trilogy on the combed dealer of drugs "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically to making its works be for all the public with something else of humor in the main current or something less of brutality of the artistic home.
A cerebral mass and some guts that spring up can not dissuade most of the followers of the artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo catches a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent cristioneros missionaries for interpretable motifs and remains blocked an eternity in the calm and the fog before its equipment arrives to America and keeps silent again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found cinematographic distributor in Germany and alone is published in DVD.
A calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody façade, a piece hides from cinema sometimes is a stimulant, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues nor of a logical action, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there is not escape for the spectators.
Refn he condede as soon as a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the mournful soundtrack of juncture make her a knot in its throat, on all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards it.
Alone a small blond youngster, who supports to Unojo faithfully, preserves something as innocence, all the others are had by the wrath.
Especially, the hero of a single eye, whose motifs are explained never, is converted in any moment in a warrior gone out of the hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
The represents the perdition, but perhaps alone for those that are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admire, to become annoyed, to be altered and to be surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of earth
The organization of nuclear energy OIEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country rejects to give an opinion on this subject until controls are allowed.
At least, around the midnight of the 5th to the 6th of September 2007, four Israeli airplanes of combat F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is in the edge of Euphrates; the biggest and nearest city, at 30 kilometers is ace-Saur Dair.
Its name appears in documents of the International Organism of Atomic Energy (OIEA), trade on a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that comes out from the river.
According to information of the service of international intelligence of USA. of the CIA of ends of April 2008, itself design an ordinary reactor under the name of the nearness of the-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which the nuclear weapons are built.
However, the technique is hardly used for other ends than for those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a presentation in video with blurry images of satellite.
They showed with an animation for computer where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, that it was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear power station of Yongbyon.
Besides they showed photographs that showed the building from the nearness or from the interior.
Did little time that the reactor was in functioning, says, but yet was not equipped with bars of fuel.
Today, three years later of the bombardment, it is hardly more not known than at that time, the enigmas were done bigger with time.
The previous president of the USA., George W. Bush revealed recently in its memories that before the attack the CIA was totally safe of the Syrians having built a reactor in the-Kibar, but that it hardly saw indications that in the country there was "a program of nuclear weapons."
In Europe, several agents of the secret service prefer being still more prudent and alone talk of a "supposed reactor," although they consider "plausible" the presentation of the CIA.
They lack solid proofs, thus as to the OIEA.
When how safe was to have in front a reactor was asked it, one loudly diplomat of the NU answered in summer in a lapidary way that the OIEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians melted with a lot of rapidity of the rubbles of the supposed "unused military building" and leveled the ground to conscience.
However, in June 2008 an equipment of the OIEA under the command of the previous chief superintendent Olli Heinonen found rastos of uranium in the-Kibar, that it had been fabricated by people.
Besides the OIEA obtained satellite photographs on a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments right after the attack, that they must have a bigger informative value of those that presented the CIA.
However, these photographs did not arrive to the market because a customer, perhaps Israel, not known bought them exclusively.
That's why the OIEA can not verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always gave that had ever had no reactor a secret nor built nuclear program.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
The OIEA refused it as unbelievable after the analyses of the particles.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discussing about this, in equal way that with regard to the satellite photographs.
Besides, to the controllers a second inspection is forbidden them in the-Kibar and the entry to the ruins of the bombarded building.
Also Israel keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment it," Ehud Olmert, first acting minister at the moment of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
Thus, the research of the case has not given results since June 2008 and "is transformed progressively in a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as an occidental diplomat of senior official corresponds with a place in the OIEA in Vienna, finally a severe infraction is pending against the treaty of proliferation proliferación de armas atomic, for which candle the OIEA.
The OIEA considers three equipments more as the key for the progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the supposed reactor, and others as these still exist.
The inspectors have not introduced publicly up to the moment of what equipments are dealt, neither which functions have, nor if they seem suspect.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated as intern ace-Sultan Marj, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, of new derivative from the nearness of the situated cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the satellite photographs, that very probably is dealt of one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly it is found in or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids with this motif the entry to the three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US. have requested from the OIEA to spy on the military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert on the equipments thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the USA.
Through photographs for satellite, the OIEA has indications that material is transferred among the three places and the bucket to the edge of Euphrates.
An occidental diplomat with a senior official in Vienna stated that at least one of the equipments can be "related to the production of fuel."
But there is not "any indication of sensitive activities," even of enrichment of uranium even of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is worked with uranium that is not enriched.
Of where the uranium having to come and where the plutonium having to be separated later for the bombs, for these central questions there is, in the best of the cases, plausible assumptions.
There are not doubts either about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can recover, are in the three places.
As the hundreds of burden of the trucks of the ground disappeared, nobody has information about where the rubbles remain.
The OIAE considers unlikely the mine of salt to the-Tibni, situated in the few kilometers from the-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its aptitude as area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the OIEA, related it to the reactor in an analysis of the satellite photographs for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians carried out movements of lands in the three supposed suspicious places and eliminated big containers that the OIEA requested the entry.
It can be chance but it hardly contributes towards dissipating the suspicion.
Besides, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the OIEA has used some months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain the possible military secret, alone the deployment exhibition the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus criticizes also this proposal.
The occidental diplomats in Vienna a year ago were calmed down with the reactor being already destroyed, that's why the matter does not have much urgency, since a couple of months, Glyn Davies, ago a type of ambassador of the US. claims the called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the OIEA, which must suggest these inspections, has talked about an option to which "I am opened in the future," but he still hesitates.
This path is very risky: For that the majority of the board of governed of the OIEA is needed, and some of the 35 countries there represented are not precisely anxious to a climbing.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "AND what passes if in the end they do not find at all?"
The love in the times of the war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of its still nameless debut.
She herself has written the hyphen, a history of love between a Bosnian and a Serb.
It is not known much more about this, but this is sufficient for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with its Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
The associations of Bosnian women have protested quickly, so in the last moment they transferred some days of filming planned for Hungary in Sarajevo.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in the post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the feminine organization of casualties of the war wrote to the Tall Commissioner of the UN, ACNUR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassadress of the Tall Commissioner of the UN for the refugees.
It is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered a meeting in Hungary that refused to him.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, states Hasecic.
Histories of love do not occur in the fields of rapes, and the position of Jolie about this gives the casualties away enough on the hyphen.
Its organization according to the Tall Commissioner of the UN for the refugees has recommended to dismiss Jolie as ambassadress, informs the Guardian.
But what has Jolie written exactly for the scenes?
The Bosnian ministry of culture that read the hyphen, granted after one throws and loosens a license of recording in Sarajevo, cause Jolie in a complete way clear is not not was in spite of everything.
The young authoress reiterates that it does not intend political purposes with its film, effort is introduced by far in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to give voice to all the implicated parts.
Its contents keep being imprecise.
In the net a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different circulates: The lovers were joint before the beginning of the war and are found again when it, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "casualty of rape falls in love with torturer."
It is an insurance that the film of Jolie really starts before the war.
The pressure on it, states Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
At present they can achieve the peace with the hackers of Hollywood: Whereas the hyphen follows in the net illegally, as many others previously.
Not at all as far from here
This afternoon it is at last good again for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
However, the equipment of home dominates on its customers of Sweden, Finland and USA.
The fans shout of joy while the loud music echoes, hit the ground with the feet.
The club Bailey vibrates in the sudirlandés Cork, because the players are thrown, and, balls of pingpong to the glasses of beer from a distance from three meters, are found
The strange show is called "Beerpong," and the prize for the winner are 500 more euros some notes of airplane to Las Vegas for the world championship of beerpong in January.
Cyan Tanner is a calm type, this eccentric game of drink and the discrete computer scientist in fact do not get on.
And the boy of 26 years tries to enjoy itself with that, to be distracted of the fulminating question, what will bring him the future.
The amusement in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January it will carry out an oral interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," states.
It "is very far of home and yet I do not have work there."
At least: Its girlfriend waits it in Auckland, "of one threw obtained the work of its dreams as manager of events, is perhaps a good signal," says the youngster and smiles.
Because of the bad perspectives at home, two of the three brothers of Tanners have already looked for luck abroad.
Its sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, its brother Colin works at present as advisor of YOU in Londrés.
The youngsters leave: In the island there are many families as that of the Tanners.
100.000 Irish will abandon the country in a near future, predict the experts in economics and the institute of social research ESRI of Dublin.
Up to 2015 200.000 emigrants are counted.
A great leak for this small country with alone 4,5 millions of inhabitants.
The predictions are confirmed, a comparable migratory wave to which the island suffered in the eighties comes.
After a decade of progression that trajó a great welfare to the Irish, at present the melancholy extends.
The economic crisis confuses especially the youngsters, well formed Irish, for those that until now, everything is slope above.
The leak of employment and the social descent seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
They need all there to be money in abundance.
But three of every ten men and women younger than thirty years are in the stop.
In the Irish Times there are cards to the director in mass of young emigrants, who complain about: "In Ireland everything is sunk."
"There should be a raising against the politicians and the bankers, but the one who can, leaves and loses our country and with that to an entire generation."
"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, student of law and president of the union of Irish students sees to appear a gloomy future because the government alone is dedicated to assemblings and any longer does not offer perspectives of future to the young people.
"They reduce the minimum salaries, but do not have strategies to achieve new jobs," states the girl of 20 years.
It observes as its colleagues go of some practices not reumneradas to the following ones.
Its biggest worry, explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People as Stephen McLarnon try to see this subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that a service offers about the subject of working abroad.
"For those that start to work, to do it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first crossings to direct your career," state the manager.
On its web page photos of a boy appear practicing surf in Australia and of another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not as doing it in the galleys, if not that it entails freedom and amusement.
Since half a year ago, Seán O'Donovan knows how it is to build something in another place.
Since there was not any longer anything to make for the engineer of 29 years, he at present works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
Now they lift a store of fashions in Gelsenkirchen.
In January it goes to Hannover or to Berlin, to the following project.
O'Donovan sees its homeland only few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a loan for its home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," states, since a lot of time of the first time that trod on the threshold of its home ago.
"I gain money in Germany for a home in Ireland, in the one that I am never so well."
He laughs a little been ashamed and he goes through frozen rooms.
The small home is in an elegant residential area with neat gardens in front of the homes, in the entry parked big and expensive cars are.
O'Donovan bought the home together with its sister four years for 380.000 euros ago, 100 per cent financed by a loan.
They "were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," says.
Does it have fear to fail with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks a while, serves more hot tea and says: "I do not have children that it has to feed and am young; if everything comes out badly, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer does not like it the complaints that listens to often at present.
"Nobody must pass hunger, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times passed here in the island," it states.
"To work a season abroad is not as badly as can pass, perhaps with that we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and it counts on its father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years it returned and the life continued in Ireland, very simple."
To Cyan Tanner it likes these ideas.
Leaving the future pending and simply seeing the life as it is in another part.
He already worked a couple of years in London and why was it not going to go well for them to it and to its girlfriend in New Zealand?
But on these days there is a thing that worries it of exceedingly: the celebration of his 27 birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears being able to degenerate in a holiday of farewell.
"Only, not too many emotions," says and gives a great gulp to its beer.
"Dismissed, it sounds very distressing."
"Better call it a holiday of going, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
He keeps increasing the support to the democracy in Latin America, as well as the back to the private enterprises.
The delinquency generates bigger worry than the unemployment does.
Besides, to a large extent of the region, Brazil is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last enquiry of the Latinobarómetro carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the enquiry has been celebrated regularly since 1995, it allows carrying out a follow-up of the changes of attitude in the region.
In the results of the enquiry of this year, carried out in September and beginnings of October, they send two related questions.
The first is the prevailing relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of the attitudes towards the democracy and its main institutions.
The support to the democracy has increased considerably in different countries of the coast of the Pacific of South America (consult the board 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth has reached an average of the 6% annual since 2002, the support to the democracy has increased this year from reduced 40% in 2005 at 61%.
It grew also in Mexico, where the economics has recovered after suffering a great descent from the production last year.
However, so alone half of the ones interviewed of Mexico and Brazil, the two countries most populated of the area, are convinced democrats, which brings down the regional average (it consults the diagram 2).
Around 44% of the ones interviewed in the region they were declared satisfied with the mode in which the democracy works in practice in its country, the same cipher that the year last, but considerably superior to the 25% registered in 2001 (diagram 3).
Around 34% it stated that they trusted the Congress of its country and 45% in its Government, the same quantity that the year passed in both cases, but considerably superior in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turbulences in Latin America affected the support to the democracy severely.
The fact that it has been maintained during the financial world crisis probably is owed to which numerous Latin American countries so alone were seen affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Besides, the existence of a social net of stronger safety has contributed towards protecting the poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America informed this week of which the proportion of Latin Americans that lives that is so single increase in a position to poverty marginally in 2009 and that has been reduced again this year, up to 32%.)
However, the state of mind varies considerably in a country to another (consult the diagram 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its overhanging president, Luiz Inácio Lula gives Silva, reflects in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and they have increased the violent crimes.
For the second time since they started the enquiries, more interviewed in Latin America mention the delinquency, instead of the unemployment, as the most severe problem that its country (consult the diagram 5) faces.
Around 31% it states that, either they or a near relative, has been a casualty of the delinquency in the last year, a cipher that has come down since 38% of the last year and that is the smallest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic performances reflect in a bigger support to the private enterprises and to the market economy: around 71% of the ones interviewed in the region they state that the private enterprises are essential for the development, whereas in 2007 it was only 56% (consult the diagram 6).
Around 58% it agrees in that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to be developed, in front of 47% last year.
It works out interesting that 62% of the ones interviewed in Venezuela opines the same (and 80% backs the private enterprises up), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private enterprises.
Brazil is the country that exerts a bigger leadership in the region, as it indicates 19% of the interviewed ones (in front of 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same cipher that last year) and Venezuela (9% in front of 11% a year ago).
However, United States is the country considered more influential by the ones interviewed in Mexico and most of Centroamérica, whereas Venezuela exhibits such a bond in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Choices to the garbage
Nobody expected the general elections celebrated on the 28th of November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they passed off in a way much worse of what the foreigners feared that they try to help the country soar after its problems.
Votes were introduced in the urns, some people voted several times, ballot papers pulled in the sewers, destroyed polling stations and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, inclusively groups displaced by the earthquake of January, wandered through the area trying to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end considered themselves beaten.
A dozen of candidates to the presidential ones, once several of the most popular had been included, denounced fraud and asked for the annulment of the choices.
The protests, some of them violent, extended through all the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the civil servant of the United Nations of biggest range in Haiti, declared that they were "some relatively good choices" in many meanings .""
The observers of the Organization of American States and of the Community of the Caribbean stated, with caution, that "we do not give an opinion that these irregularities, for severe that are, invalidate necessarily the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is embarrassing with René Préval, the unpopular overhanging president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on the 7th of December.
It is foreseen that the play-off will be carried out in January.
All the expectations in relation to the choices have not been lost yet.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn its initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the poll.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who hardly has support, if it has one, has passed to the second round.
Taking that the epidemic of the cholera devastates the country and more than one a million the survivors of the earthquake keep living in stores into account, a great abstention is waited for.
Once the moment had arrived, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not manage to make it due to a lack of organization.
About 250.000 documents of identity, necessary to vote, had not been distributed little before the choices yet.
There is a lot in game.
The donors of help consider that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential crossing in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has remained obvious, the Haitians themselves also think it.
Advancing from sprigs towards the center
In the weeks that they have gone by since it lost its husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great friendliness among the public who has increased its index of popularity in 20 points, up to more of 50%, the biggest level that it has registered from its choice in 2007.
In spite of everything, his being able to convert it into a successful campaign for a second mandate in the choices of the year that it comes will depend on whether clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves of side the intransigence of its husband deceased man, its predecessor and political member, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this point, the indications are not definitive.
Mr. Kirchner, that kept seeing about the economic policy that it even afterwards of its wife succeeding it as president, had the habit of elaborating budgets that underestimated the fiscal admissions, the economic growth and the inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to use up the admissions additional to its discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs. Fernández lost its majority in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is, a situation that it has worsened after the decease of Kirchner because of a heart attack on 27 of October, divided up.
Some discrepant members of the peronista movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which a representative gave him a punch to another in the face and other representatives accused the government of bribery, the Congress decided to refuse the budget of 2011.
"Not I am going to discuss," said the president.
The budget of 2010, consequently, will be applied on the next year, which will offer the president a margin of still bigger action at the time of using it up.
The economics is improving considerably: probably it grows even 9% this year.
The rate of official inflation is at present by 11,1%, but numerous private calculations, besides the wage demands of the trade unions, situate it near 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed the power in 2003 when Argentina was economic at the edge of the collapse, made the growth and the reduction of the poverty be its priorities, instead of the control of the inflation.
It refused to dealing with the FMI, pressed to the private sector and it made that the INDEC, the institute of statistics, adapted the official statistics of inflation.
Will the president Fernández moderate now these policies?
He has called for meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the trade unions.
Besides, its civil servants state that they want to limit the raises in wages the year close to 18%.
The economics has been seen given impulse by the high prices of the Argentinian agricultural exports in the world.
However, the inflation has limited the impulse to the growth obtained with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for is reason Mrs. Fernández is giving signals of wanting to restore the financial links of Argentina with the rest of the world.
To beginnings of the year, the government arrived to an agreement with the headlines of bonds that had been denied to a previous obligatory restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about in the Club of Paris, to which she owes about 6.700 million dollars, creditors grouped together to celebrate an agreement with the governments.
The Kirchner always insisted in that this would not imply the monitoring of the FMI, as it is usually usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Background will offer "technical assistance" to elaborate a new national retail price index, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It does not remain clear if the President Fernández wants to continue in the policy when it finishes its mandate, taking that it does not have its husband any longer at its side into account.
If he makes it, it will need to earn the support of the average class, big part of which he has gotten tired of the kirchnerismo.
When the Argentines go back from its summer holidays in March, the wave of friendliness for it will have decayed.
If it wants to gain other choices, it will have to decide whether it rejects or not, with calmness, many of the policies of its husband.
Half a hurray for China
The voters of Taiwan are approaching slowly a nearer sort of union with the continent.
What does Taiwan opine on its big brother at the other side of the strait?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70% of the eligible ones, went on 27 of November to choosing the mayors and town councilors of five urban districts in what seems a wide evaluation of the president, Tues Ying-jeou.
The man himself Tues has been returned a defender of the feelings through the continent, forging innovative business links, including a pact of partial free trade, the biggest changes in the relations with China since 1949.
The gentleman Tues passed the proof, but for little.
Although its match Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five choices to town council, it did not manage to obtain most of the votes.
In its place, the democratic progressive Match (PPD), which has inclined for a total independence from Taiwan, obtained practically 50% of all the votes in front of 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential ones, the gentleman Tues would be in problems.
From its choice two years ago, the proportion of votes of its match has decreased in about one 8%.
For the first time, the PPD drew with the KMT in the town councils.
In the choices the typical elements of the Taiwanese choices could be seen, including noisy trucks of campaign and great agglomerations with flags and light girls of clothes dancing.
The mysterious attempt at murder of rigor was not lacking either.
Be Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was the night doing campaign for one of the candidates of the KMT before the choices.
A man of the crowd shot to the youngster directly to the face, hurting it and killing a passer-by.
What is curious is that it has not been able to be determined if the man intended to do damage to Lien or to take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, it says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the firing affected the choices, sowing suspicions on the PPD and provoking that the voters inclined for the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign went China.
It was surprising that the matter of the continent was not treated in itself.
In its place, the candidates talked about plans of public accommodation and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its independence from facto and detests the military threat of China.
Therefore, the KMT usually prevents to give publicity to its links with the government in Peking.
But this time also the PPD prevented to encourage the feeling against China.
He answers to the new conscience that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
On its part, the gentleman Tues stated that it had been confirmed that its policy with regard to China was acceptable for most of the Taiwanese ones.
It is foreseen that the Government of Peking keeps bribing them with the trade, in accordance with its strategy to manage that Taiwan turns over to the sheepfold.
China did not waste time sending Taipei a negotiator to prepare a summit on the protection of the inversions and the medical cooperation.
Undoubtedly, it would like to obtain likewise the political integration, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best thing will be to wait for them to pass the presidential choices of 2012 for that.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he found in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigated the explicit independence openly.
However, under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation of moderate has risen up and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and youngsters.
Mrs. Tsai has been received nicely as candidate of the PPD for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who complied with mandate under Chen.
Now its match is making everything possible because it proves that it can also have relations with Peking.
Mrs. Tsai announced the plans of creation of a group of experts who acts as contact point between the PPD and China, as long as the negotiations can be carried out without previous conditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells Tues with regard to China to the Taiwanese public that its match represents a "reliable alternative" to the precipitate approach of the gentleman.
Mr. Chen seems furious by the change.
In a declaration emitted from its cell, it stated that the candidates of the PPD would have gone out better stopped if they had insisted in that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even it ordered to Mr. Su, one pragmatic, that it did not introduce the presidential ones.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulties to choose among its possible candidates.
The KMT must also make an examination of conscience.
The appraisals of the gentleman Tues have been poor, in spite of the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to do campaign with it.
Its lack of popularity seems to owe to the unemployment and to the increasing differences among rich and poor mainly.
A spokesman of the KMT states that it will restructure its cabinet, as well as the home teams.
The big exhibitions of the PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan is limited to an approach.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese ones consider that the economic integration with China is unavoidable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of non return" has already been crossed .""
Nominations to the Grammy: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of revelation Artist.
It acts at the request of a president and the people will possibly notice you.
Expectation Spalding, the decreasing and singing one of jazz of 26 years selected personally by the President Obama to act in its ceremony of the prize Nobel de la Paz in 2009, meant one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination of high level in the category of Better Revelation Artist.
Taking that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of the jazz from its album of 2008, "Expectation," into account the nomination gives what to think, but respects the norms of the Grammys according to which it must be an artist that has not taken more than three albums "out" for the market before recording the one that "determines the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," undoubtedly meant a great advance and, taking into account its style member light and nice, like this as, a distinction between Spalding and the path towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, that lately have concentrated on the area of the jazz for this category can at least be established by a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy did honor with reason to "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, a thrilling and magnificent disk that was one of the favourites last year.
Among the competitors of Iyer the veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4 B" and the keyboard player John Beasley for "Positootly" is found .""
Trombone Shorty, a strident favourite in New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme," of the HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, that by the rest it is inclined considerably towards the merge as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The punk savage of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of great groups, competing against the great jazz of camera of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risked Dave Holland, whose live album with its octet, "Pathways," was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bass guitar player in its band.
Nominations to the prizes Grammy: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in better address of classic albums
The nominations in the area of the classical music for the 53rd edition of the Prizes Grammy include a mixture of musicians and composers of all the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus ex Machina," for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse," a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links with the south of California they meet the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for its symphony no 4, "The Angeles," a responsible part for the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and used for the first time in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman also is nominated by its Mandolin Concerto.
The nominations of classical music are distributed in thirteen categories that include albums of orchestra, opera, choral and alone.
The category of classic producer of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Navy and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the album of classical music are Bruckner for the Symphonies no 3 and no 4 of the Orchestra Royal Concertgebouw; Daugherty for "Deus ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Symphony Orchestra of Nashville; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of opera, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour of Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The nominating composers to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include to Pärt for the Symphony no 4, Daugherty for "Deus ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
The Symphony no 4 of Pärt was used for the first time in the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a recorded session for the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The part, of approximately 30 minutes, is nicknamed "The Angeles" and it is dedicated Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia, to the former magnate of the oil.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman is nominated instrumental soloist with orchestra by the performance.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the part of 15 minutes specifically so that Avi Avital, which interpreted the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based on New York touched it in mandolin.
"It composed it with sounds of Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms of the north of Africa," declared Dorman in a telephone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, of 85 years, was nominated in the category of function of orchestra, because it directed the Symphony Orchestra of Chicago during a recording of works of Stravinsky.

In the category of mixture of classic, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated by its recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque suggested in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of law
The project of mosque for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the commission of local law after more than five hours of public testimonies, often worked up.
The reviewers attacked the project saying that it encourages the terrorism and the jams.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday at night that the new religious center respected the local legislation and would be impressive from the esthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show its support, Christians as well as Jews or bahaíes, of all the religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the valley of Temecula, on Thursday in the morning.
"The truth is that, as American citizen, it makes me proud."
"It proves that the justice prevails."
"The opposition is minimum really," adds.
"Solo that they speak very high."
"In this it fences in there is marvelous people."
The meeting started at six in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time he dedicated itself to people that interceded in favor or against the center, practically the same quantity on every side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued in the web site of the newspaper.
"United States any longer it" does not "exist," is read in one of the comments.
"It is about another Planet of the apes with dead Madam Freedom in the sand."
"America has "fallen."
The plans of construction of Islamic centers have provoked protests also in other parts of the country, inclusively near the area zero, the area of New York where the attacks of the 11th of September 2011 took place.
In the Valley of Temecula, the magnet Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
Its congregation of nearly 135 families takes years living together troublefree in the county of Riverside, but she wanted a space bigger and better than the store that she rented in a shared estate with a manufacturer of systems of filtering of water.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectonic style, would include two minarets and would ascend up to the 43 feet.
It would occupy a surface of 4,32 acres in Nicolas Road, at about two miles in the east of the institute Chaparral.
The opponents can still recur the project before the municipal Board.
A microbe resistant to the arsenic poses the possibility of new livings in the Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility to find new livings in the Earth and, possibly, in other planets.
Although the investigators discovered the curious bacterium here in the Earth, they say that it proves that it is possible that there are livings without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That converts it in something very peculiar, although little misses it to be a type of living really 'alien'," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report that appears in the edition in line of Thursday of the publication Science.
Since some time ago, it is considered that there are six great essential elements for the life: the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the phosphorus and the sulfur.
However, the investigators have discovered that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can keep growing after replacing the phosphorus by the arsenic.
"It does you to suggest you what más is possible," stated Ariel D. Anbar de la Arizona State University, coauthor of the report.
As it indicated Anbar, the finding is important for the search of life in planets different to the Earth, since the investigators need to be able to recognize the life, to know the aspect that has.
The study is focused in a microbe discovered in the Earth.
However, the call of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery did not spread, generated a great speculation in Internet on the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He did not make it.
What the discovery "yes exhibition is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to give impulse to its biochemistry and that the ensemble of elements standard that we consider essential for the life perhaps is not so fixed," commented on Charles Cockell, head of department of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the equipment of research.
"This work is new because it proves the replacement of an element for another in the biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not carried out by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the institute of astrobiología of the NASA, that it directed the study, focused on the Monkey Lake because it presents high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and the phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, for what speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one for another.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of the phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can be it complicated to the organisms to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is different enough as so that it does not work as well as the phosphorus, for what enters and, for saying it somehow, compresses the biochemical machinery," it explains Anbar.
The investigators collected the known bacteria as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to concentrations every time bigger of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it proves that he can live with arsenic in its place poses the possibility of there being able to be in a natural way a living that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, auxiliary professor of microbiology in the Flowery University of, indicated that the idea that the arsenic can be replaced by the phosphorus is not new, but it had never found an example that proved that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the first you were of the Earth, indicated, for what the investigators speculated that the first livings can have used it.
"Yes that it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not alone the mode in which the life was formed in the Earth formerly," indicated Foster, which was not part of the equipment of research of Wolfe-Simon.
The research had the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that were lacking have been in Compton
The two dogs that were lacking of the four stolen ones have been in front of the motel Bellflower, as the officers of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles stated Thursday.
The four dogs of competition, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when somebody stole the van Chevrolet Express of 2006 in which they were passing the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as they indicated the authorities.
Two of the canines were recovered on Wednesday in the afternoon and the two remaining ones were found on Wednesday, late at night, as it informed Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are found well," stated Whitmore.
"They are in good state."
"They have returned with its legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where found not even the circumstances of the discovery the dogs, in what neighborhood.
"A research is being carried out."
"We do not mean anything," stated Whitmore.
"We are following some tracks."
He could not meet the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, so that they did some comment on Thursday.
They met its two Akitas in a shelter of animals of the county in Downey on Wednesday in the afternoon.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and both dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Draw, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog in 10 months) had not suffered damages.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis which Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, followed missings until Wednesday at night.
Peek and Rickard, which they live in Redding, were in the city for the national championship AKC/Eukanuba in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention of exhibiting Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions foreseen for the days prior to the championship AKC/Eukanuba, as it indicated Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
The south of California is one of the shutdowns in the tour practically of two months that the couple carries out taking part in canine competitions.
On Monday at night, Peek and Rickard did the check-in in the motel.
Normally they stay in motels and park the van exactly in front of the window of its room.
They took to another three dogs (a baby animal of boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, that they slept with them in the room of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be fresher.
They left the slightly open windows so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard denounced the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to any that could drive them up to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday was not clear if a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM obtains the final approval of the court
Finally, after 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has obtained green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal judge of bankruptcies of New York approved officially the plan "preassembled" for the creditors to erase approximately 5 a billion dollars of debt, leveling the path so that the company of entertainment of 86 years focuses its efforts in the production and debut of films and programs of television.
The failure of Thursday confirms that the plan complies with the demands of the code of American bankruptcy, for what there are not other legal obstacles so that MGM is rethrown under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that they will convert in the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will come down of 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not go out from the Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes an instrument of planned loan of 500 million dollars, to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The merchant bank is syndicating at present the loan, which for its account it is contributing with 75 million dollars, and it is expected to be financed mid December.
The process of restructuring of the study started in May 2009, when the merchant bank Moelis and CO. was hired to give advice on the necessary management to order its finances, while it fought to be able to carry out payments of interests for 300 million dollars per year.
In August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an Ex President of Enron and expert in recovery of companies in bankruptcy, known by its work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper of solving the financial tribulations of MGM and satisfying the more than 140 creditors of the study, required much more time than what had been expected.
After several months of discussions, to ends of 2009 the parts agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted to few bidders and no ready to pay the more than 2 a billion dollars that the creditors looked for.
Before the spring of this year, it returned to the table of design while the equipment of MGM started to work in a plan of restructuring that finally, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was backed up by the creditors to ends of October.
When MGM officially comes out of the bankruptcy in the next weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive multimillionaire increases by its work.
Moelis and CO., that it has already received 1,2 million dollars, will obtain a payment of 9,5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, which has been raising 375.000 dollars per month for its services of administration of the company, will receive some "fees of success" of 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew the production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and brought together an annual blackboard of seven or eight films that will come out in 2012.
They also plan to cofinance two films based on "The Hobbit," together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to agree on a loan separated from between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who possesses 18% of the debt of MGM approximately, had been trying to fix a merge of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the biggest stockholder.
However, the recent conversations between both companies did not work out in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gifts
Whereas the iPad is the main candidate to be the most marvelous toy of this year, followed for, maybe, the Microsoft system of video games Kinect, both can mean a significant nick in its budget for gifts.
Slope Kinect considers it the same as 10 classic ropes of jump adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 cans of the Play-Doh that for the price of a iPad five bicycles BMX of 99 dollars can buy each, and a game to themselves.
But there are modes of holding its budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three vendors of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Law of Moore has been working; the technological toy of this year will probably have more power, costing what is same and even a little less compared with that of the last year.
Besides, while generally there are less new toys with associated web sites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the toys given impulse by batteries of button are increasing, thus as the toys with rechargeable drummers.
Here there are some recommendations.
(All the prices are Us of Toys "R," except that it is indicated in another way).
The Sing-to-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are toys of felt of the size of a cobayo that sing a note when its bellies are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze starts to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: Once it starts to be tight, it can not stop.
For combined edge with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking lent of the technology of Elmo Live of the last year, the animatrónico doll of 14 inches plays games of change on duty as Simóm Dice, and can do the lunar crossing, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with device of blockade.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as an instructor of dance, although its fathers complained for the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the eighties, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computarizados educational toys.
He has gone back (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a knapsack full of cards of designed questions to convert an avenue by car into a session with a notebook of exercises of bright self-correction.
If you are apprehensive of giving you to its child its intelligent telephone, here independent alternative econtrará three.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and the easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not show with as much efficiency as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years), is the first important tune-up of the line Leapster, with one screen newer and shining.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the type iTunes to present games and electronic books, and has SD that allows viewing photos of family a slot for cards.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five hardly bigger blocks that a box of matches, each with its own screen LED.
The goal is to arm words placing the blocks in a row that the time finishes; it is formidable for an improvised competition of armed of words.
They are every time more the toys that have some class of connection in line.
Based on its presence only in jugueterías, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy it to its son a mascot in line in the Club Penguin, for example, a Disney Club Penguin can obtain 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, from 6 to 12 years) that it includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code in line, its son obtains sufficient loans in the store of the Club Penguin for two articles.
These could include skates on wheels or a mascot toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger that the pig of its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last thing in a line of microrobots given impulse by batteries of button.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random addresses.
Is amused to do a labyrinth of blocks to see whether it can find the exit.
It is also long-lasting.
Ours was capable of leaving the table of the cooking and even passing a while in the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of the maintenance of the order is promoted in China
As an urban instructive sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the crossing in a post of the city, inspecting the nervous people to its charge with severity, emitting orders in a quiet voice with military authority.
He wanted for the feminine members of chengguan, the corpulent policemen of the urban order of China, feared and despised by its capricious vigorous measures and its dip to the violence, to communicate a certain impression at a handful of spectators.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
They show them, whispered, "how they are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who hardly passed the adolescence with white gloves and identical olive-colored jackets and trousers adjusted to catch the attention.
Four perfectly aligned black pairs of shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on the hair tied with striped buns blue and white.
"Personally, I think that they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, desdeñosamente.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered all the new recruits having a bond of degree.
The Province of Guangdong changed the supposedly more attractive greyish green color of the uniforms to a blue.
Wuhan, in China central, replaced the use of force by intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded to a fractious trolley of snacks, and observed it with the frown gathered constantly during half an hour, until the itinerant salesman collected its things and it left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a change of radical image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women, expressly chosen by its appearance, proportion and youth, to its urban police.
The idea is to give the coarse police a softer side, feminine.
Regrettably, even Scarlett Johansson should fight to increase the insignificant respect of China towards these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, they would put forward the reviewers.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to do to comply with orderlies of the city, imposing fines and other administrative sentences.
But the Chinese means of news portray a different reality routinely.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed to knocks a passer-by after having used his cellular to film them while they dissolved a protest against a waste tip of residue.
Last year, a manual of formation for inspectors of Peking was stolen and published in internet, in which it was described as whipping criminals with efficiency without making them bleed.
This year, an itinerant salesman of watermelons of Shanghai suffered cerebral damage after an argument with five officers.
A game of video full of available violence to unload in line, introduces inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack newsboys.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," China Daily, a national publication, complained the year passed after another controversy about tactics.
The journal really required "a cleaning meticulous."
The sceptical ones say that the current approach is very far from this.
That the district requested eight new through a notice recruits feminine in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News was asked if the women had real duties or they were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both things.
The notice of the district asked feminine candidates of 18 to 22 years," with a good figure and the five harmonious facial features.
They had to have a height above the average, superior to 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at 26 years of age is obligatory.
The civil servants said that the work was physically too hard for women with more than 25 years.
"Its image is the important thing," an anonymous civil servant of district told Rednet.com, a governmental cuasi web site, to her.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they comply with the requirements, as height, peso, facial features, etc."
Afterwards it comes" the interior temperament and qualities."
The feminine chengguan are as flower vases, said, and added, "besides being flower vases, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, assistant manager of the office of administration of the city of the district, is not anxious to back that description up.
But he observed that the demands of height were standards in many Chinese notices of work for both sexes.
Afterwards the demand of harmonious facial features comes.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Probably, the disabled or disfigured one must not present itself.
"We can not allow a person to catch or one humpbacked come to to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Its image would not be well."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Post Baoguang nearly one monastery, has 22 years, with its red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
It does not think that the accent in its aspect is sexist, said.
"You think that I seem sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
Its colleague of work with dimples, Xu Yang, of 21 years, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They do not oppose either its in time determined work, said, because they harbor bigger ambitions of career simply to scare away to vendors in the alleys where it is supposed that they limit its business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen of itinerant vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofú as be possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, has to leave.
"We have said it many times!" the lady said Xu while a salesman escaped on foot, giving up in a temporary way its cart pulled by bicycle with garnishes of noodles.
The officers describe its duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is the same more or less every day," Huang Jing, of 20 years, said who studies marketing in its free hours.
"Very routine."
A reason is that the feminine officers lack the power of its masculine counterparts of confiscating the merchandise of the vendors.
They can only threaten with reporting the offenders to its man supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common everywhere of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rose up that the false rumor that some chengguan officers had murdered a salesman spread out.
More than one dozen of policewomen or chengguan officers were injured persons in the nocturnal episode; 14 vehicles of the government were overturned or fastened fire.
For the moment Xindu has prevented such a violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only to two streets of the calm Post Baoguang, where the feminine officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the sidewalk instead of in a factory, as it requires the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted rudely.
The situation was held up during 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, made the way to the nudges up to its vehicles and were been quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, of 40 years, a coordinator assigned to the masculine squadron, remained behind, with its given white insignia turned over to conceal its name.
As the feminine officers, the coordinators, men of 40 years or more, redeem a paper purely of support.
Unlike them, they are not shown to holding an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturalness.
"Most of the time the one that starts the fight is the public."
The prosecutors will not lift charges against the Senator Ensign
The lawyers of the senator announced the Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have exonerated the Senator John Ensign of the criminal imputations that rose up from its affair with an ex assistant of campaign and its efforts to guarantee work through lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision finishes with the most serious legal threat that confronts Ensign, the Republican of Snowstorm that was considered as possible presidential candidate Republican for 2012, until the scandal on its affair had national headlines last year and damaged its career.
The office of Ensign said that it "probably" felt "happy" for the decision, which arrived after a research of an entire year.
The senator could still confront a disciplinary measure of the committee of ethics of the Senate.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed" us "that the Senator Ensign is not a goal of its research any longer and that it does not have any plan of lifting charges against it for this subject."
The Department of Justice did not want to do comments on the case.
The advertisement was a surprise for many lawyers of ethics out of the Department of Justice, that they said that it seemed there to be significant proofs to indicate that Ensign rotted to have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, the electronic mail and other documents that in the first place were spread in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped to Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and its wife, Cynthia, on the affair of the senator with it.
Mrs. Hampton worked once as treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign was contacted several political sponsors work to find it for Mr. Hampton and it advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to do lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had been recently an assistant of Ensign, it was excluded according to the law of doing lobby for its ex employer or the Senate during a year.
The experts in ethics said that the unusual hotfix between Ensign and Hampton, which were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the call "revolving door lobbying ban," that it looks for restricting that state ex employees use its connections to do personal businesses.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed facie premium of a conspiracy to be a case to violate substantially the statue revolving door," a lawyer of Washington who specializes in defending customers investigated by the government, said Stanley Brand.
While the civil servants of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers of ethics they said that the department seemed cautious at the time of accepting processings politicians after several important backhands for its section of public integrity, including the decision of the last year of giving up the processing against the Ex Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges for misconduct of procedure.
The federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for the Responsibility and the Ethics in Washington, a group of defense that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that the civil servants of the government of high range now can mean that the laws are not applied to them," added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that a telephone call of a prosecutor of the Department of Justice received Monday and another call more the day after, telling him that the department did not want to lift charges against its customer.
The equipment of defense of Ensign had been cooperating with the prosecutors in the attempt of persuading them that the senator, as its office reiterated Wednesday in a declaration, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explaining with detail the legal arguments that it gave him to the prosecutors.
I do not feel comfortable entering in details on my discussions with the Department of Justice, alone I can say that we think that they took the just decision," said.
Last month, the Federal Commission of Choices decided to change a research into a complaint separated by the group of ethics, which she claims that a payment of 96.000 dollars of the fathers of Ensign to the Hampton violated the electoral federal statute.
The electoral commission said that it did not have sufficient proofs to prove that the money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Snowstorm that it had supported for a lot of time to the senator, which obtained work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave to Hampton.
An electronic mail sent in December 2008 proved that that the company accepted Hampton as lobbista, the head of cabinet of Ensign, John Lopez, she communicated with Hampton and told him that it "was crushing" the Ministry of the Interior on a question in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the secretary of transport to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobby.
When for first appeared the news of the affair last year, Ensign asked it pardon to its electors and Republican in the Senate renounced its position as leading quarter.
After maintaining a low profile during many months, two weeks ago Ensign told the journalists that planned to be postulated for a third mandate in the Senate to him.
When the spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was not the target of a criminal research any longer, he said that the senator expected the committee of ethics to follow quickly the example of the Department of Justice and to conclude its research.
"The Senador Ensign has desires to continue with its difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," said.
The advocation of Cheshire will note Twitter
There was "chateando" half a dozen of them in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute at minute, sent reports of the dreadful way testimony Twitter.
In the end, it says the defense, there was more than 140.000 messages of Twitter on the process that approached the rape and the children tied to its beds in a home that was fastened fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed of Steven J. Hayes, the one who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive to an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death sentence voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have presented the courts writings in the court that the arguments of the advocations that probably they will occupy delineate for years.
One of the most provocative states that the intense reports on the process, the wide use of Twitter included on the part of the journalists of means of massive information, it created "an atmosphere of circus," and such a generalized and immediate saturation with exaltadores details made the public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The call could oblige to the judges in appeal to fighting with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the laws of the individual to having a process exactly," said Thomas J. Ullmann, main lawyer of the defense of Mr. Hayes.
The circuit judge Jon C. Blue, of the Superior State Court, refused laconically the demands in a failure the week passed, saying that the means of news were "carefully controlled" and that there was not any proof that the jury has been taken by the passion.
But probably it will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of advocation have recognized that the coverage of cases you celebrate can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historical failure of 1966, the Supreme Court of United States revoked the sentence of an osteopath of Cleveland, the doctor Sam Sheppard, for the murder of its wife, saying in its decision, in the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell, which there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
He thinks that the crime had been inspired by the program of television and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the courts of advocations that examined the sentence of Mr. Hayes half a century later, could be felt intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something inimaginadable in the period of the case of the doctor Sheppard.
"There is a general motif of worry on the impact of the new media" in processes of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the School of Laws of Stanford, which studied the death sentence of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said that this was imposed arbitrarily.
The professor Donohue said that some judges in appeal could feel intrigued by the idea that limiting the immediate communication from the courtrooms could make that the judgments were juster.
The question of Twitter is only one of many of the subjects delineated by the lawyers of Hayes, which probably will be discussed for years, deferring an execution.
The lawyers of the defense also state, for example, that Hayes could have been damaged when the Juez Blue refused to allow them that testearan the reactions of the potential juries, showing them hair-raising photographs of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the casualties, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, of 48 years, and its daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
The lawyers of the defense say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death sentence and they will hold that the judge incorrectly mixed up to a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that incorrectly had pressed for a verdict for its strange decision of ordering it the jury to deliberate during a weekend.
The juries were not confiscated.
But its arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in an objection to the verdict filed the last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of United States.
They argued that the media continuously threw firewood to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The agglomeration daily of the tweets of the means, the cameras and the reporters out of the court," wrote the lawyers, "something never seen here went in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
People debate about its attention in the coverage of Tweeter.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news was more important that the reports delivered more slowly, were a ludita vision that would make the policy of the court on the control of the coverage be weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of advocation often felt attracted by the arguments on the adaptation that was required in the courts due to the social changes and technological.
The lawyers of Hayes are pressing for that call.
In its writing, it were referred to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, that the sentence of the doctor Sheppard dismisses due to the coverage of the process, and left in clearing that they would require that the new means would require new rules.
"This case," wrote, "Sheppard vs represents the case. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can the public spirit lay out a bridge to join the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for the invective and the negativity, this week a little public spirit has broken out in Washington.
Is it an omen of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a fast turn to the partisan combat in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not cause any advance in the great subjects that must be treated during the overhanging session.
But for what they say all, was at least a polite discussion on the differences of both parts, as well as a recognition of its responsibilities shared to govern, instead of being another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the commission of deficit of the president was equally civilized, in spite of the political differences that subsist among the members.
Clearing seems that the close interaction during a period in months generated a mutual respect that spreads the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is hardly sufficient to declare that one new has arrived was of cooperation.
Now both parts are in a probationary period, being probed mutually to identify signs of cooperative system and appointment, while they try to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
Motif for which the meeting of Tuesday and the posterior evaluations of the same one on the part of the participants were done with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and are very deep-rooted as to suggest any fast change of the climate that existed during the last two years.
It is already that they are taxes, expenses, sanitary assistance or social help, both parts are in opposed poles.
Anyway, the choice of November has softened the humor in Washington, at least short-term.
"There is not any doubt that the things have changed with regard to the mode of saying the things ," said Pete Wehner, a civil servant of the administration of Bush now in the Center of Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are unavoidable after the choices.
The choices arouse partisan passions, which afterwards become extinct.
That is good."
In some questions, in those that appear in the agenda of the overhanging session, the Republicans and Democrats another option does particularly not have to find a solution.
The reductions of taxes of Bush are overcome at the end of year, and anybody is in favor of this.
Both parts want to find a mode of preserving some or all the reductions, of permanent or temporary mode.
In the same way, it is probable that there is an appointment to extend the unemployment compensations, probably because the Republicans can not make think that they are plus of the reductions of taxes for the rich ones, denying the unemployment compensation for the unemployed workers.
After the meeting of Tuesday in the White Home, there is bigger optimism by a possible deal on these subjects during the overhanging session, together with the ratification of the new pact of nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Institution Brookings, warns that the successful cooperation in the urgent questions of the overhanging session will not drive necessarily to a continuous bipartism when the new 112do. Congreso meets in January.
It stated, on the contrary, that it is very probable and even unavoidable, that it starts a period of disagreement.
That the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term the psychology will return the situation to one of confrontation" stated.
Also Wehner expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the public spirit can lead to a real cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen among now and 2012 as an essay for the main event of 2012," stated.
The motifs have a lot that to see with the constitution of the new majority Republican in the Home and the voters of the Torch Party, which contributed decisively to its creation.
For more conscience that the Republican leaders have on the dangers of exaggerating its position, know that they must try to comply its promises of cutting back the expenses of the been and to nullify the new law of health.
Those partisan lines they are already observed clearly in the initial reactions in the face of the recommendations of the commission of deficit, which include the reform of the tributary code and the increase of some taxes and of the pensionable age, and the cutback of expenses.
The cochairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been in charge of one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to its own appraisal, the cochairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have introduced by force the question of the deficit in the public agenda in a way unaware of which people can not be.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish its plan as an official recommendation, and have been fighting to arrive near that cipher.
The biggest endurance is among the civil servants chosen in the panel, suggesting that in fiscal questions there is, at least at present, few bases or desire for the appointment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles among the Republicans of the White Home and those of the Congress.
The first will happen the next year in the form of partisan collisions, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, the taxes and the medical assistance, followed afterwards by a period of bigger bipartisan cooperation.
What would provoke the change?
The public opinion.
There are considerable proofs that, in spite of the partisanship of the recent choice, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two ones broken up working joint.
If the confrontation leads to a neutral gear, as it happened in 1995, both matches will then observe the reaction of the people with attention.
Whoever they consider that he is probably losing will change course and will look for appointment.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
The partisanship and the biasing at present are bigger than were in the middle of the years 1990, and seems to have a bigger ideological hollow among Obama and Republicans of the Congress of the one that there was between the President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in its moment.
At the same time, the activists of both matches see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental choice in 2012.
Once this reality has been given, the civilismo that is shown this week can be welcome for many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on behalf of both sides to find points in common in the questions that still divide them up.
A filtered American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of the corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracia," and it leaves a part of the bribery and money of protection that raises directly the Kremlin, as it informed in February the American Embassy in Russia.
It was informed that the police as well as the Service of Federal Safety handle enormous systems of blackmail, which helps explain the high cost of the life in Moscow.
They raise money not only of legitimate businesses, but also of organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what the First Minister Vladimir Putin has named the "vertical authority," takes its part as the money goes up in the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in its web site on Wednesday.
The note is based on fountains whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and blames it by much of the corruption.
The President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed it in October, but there has been few evidence of a cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and its wife, Yelena Baturina, who possesses an important company of construction, have denied systematically the accusations of corruption throughout the years, and he has gained several demands for libel on such accusations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked it about a documentary that he suggested that was corrupt, it stated: It "is a madness, a story, a nuisance."
According to the enquiries, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that its society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in a detailed way, since they were in the report of the embassy, and it is unprecedented that those that make that are the diplomats of a foreign country.
"The direct links of the government of the city of Moscow with the criminality have taken to some to call it dysfunctional, and to state that the government works more as a cleptocracia than as a government," states the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy of a 'krysha' (a term of the world criminal and of the Mafia that literally means "ceiling" or protection ") that it transfers the police, the Federal Service of Safety (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Matters (MVD), and the office of the prosecutor, as well as all the sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is in the highest thing."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are in the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are in the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which the criminal groups fill an emptiness in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS raises the money of the biggest companies, and that the police note the small trades.
A fountain, stated the report, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that the best thing is to obtain the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the groups of the organized crime) already that they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminal groups, but also are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection against the criminal gangs is not a priority more."
The note observes that, whereas the collection of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even the ones that they pay are subject to the arrest.
Those that they do not pay quickly find its businesses closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has talked several times on the fight against the corruption, but it has confessed that it has achieved little progress.
The note of the embassy informs about men taking suitcases, probably full of ready money, in the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against the corruption, Medvedev has to trust the administrative officials," stated Georgy Satarov, director of the group of experts of Indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to some politicians, because there are not any longer some politicians in Russia."
Without the policy, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, it stated, the corruption is unavoidable.
At a national scale, Indem estimates that the corruption costs it to Russia more than 300 a billion dollars per year.
In a recent enquiry on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in the post 154 (the countries are classified of the less to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the note of the American Embassy, that it did not happen until late at night hour of Moscow, it will probably cause disappointment in the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov can be blamed by the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity so that the Kremlin argues that is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN for Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents WikiLeaks could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that stated that the American diplomats called it Batman and to Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related with our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country," stated.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have gotten of such an arrogance hold, with such a pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Khmers obliged to confronting the past
In a weakly illuminated specific classroom, with marked and chipped walls, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng remembered the man that, the last leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok, had built it.
"Here they all love Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader and it worried about its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, of 42 years.
Known as "the Butcher" for its brutality during the government of the Red Khmers, the commander keeps being popular in this remote ex strength of the Red Khmers in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of ex soldiers of the organization still live.
But finally this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers surrendered before the government, the loyalty sustained by a lot of time is being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, one local forum for the truth and the reconciliation allowed it to the casualties that they confronted publicly with the people who had taken part in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school that for the first time shows him the history of the Red Khmers to the children of its ex soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia they emitted the first sentence of an ex member of the Red Khmers, Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, at 35 years of prison, declaring the ex head of the known center of torture.
With each of those events, the anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for the reconciliation and its attempts to return to the Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the Red Ex Khmers, but can not do anything," stated Chhang Youk, director of the Center of Documentation of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates to the regime.
"For them, the life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime has turned into a symbol of the evil."
"This is generating divisions in the families."
During the government of the Red Khmers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or approximately 1,7 million people died of hunger, illness or excess of work.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and brought down to the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of the regime and its soldiers they ran away to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched a revolt that lasted up to the last movement that was yielded in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the occidental guerrilla warfare from its bases in the mountains and the forests of Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the nineties, that a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the first democratic choices of the country in 1993, great groups of combatants of the Red Khmers started to desert towards the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by forces of the government in 1999 in the near Mountains Dangrek.
It died in one prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while it waited for the process.
Without the support of its benefactors, the most former combatants of the Red Khmers fell in the absolute misery that is common in the rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia by the movement.
Although a few civil servants of elite of the Red Khmers kept its local administrative posts in exchange for laying its weapons down, the privates keep being poor and not qualified farmers.
"These people have obtained few profits after the surrender," stated Sok Leang del Centro for the Justice and the Reconciliation, who offers public forums through all Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have the utopian land ideology of the regime incorporated."
"They were bred without any concept to do businesses."
Sor Lim, of 55 years, who was joined to the Red Khmers when it was an adolescent in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before dedicating itself to the life as farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"The life with the Red Khmers was well," stated.
"Ta Mok gave it of eating all."
"But now the life is difficult because we have to selfsupply ourselves."
The current court of the Red Khmers has also caused worries here.
At the beginning of the next year, it is expected the court to start to prosecute Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and its wife, Ieng Thirith, another ex minister of the Red Khmers.
The mandate of the court it is that of prosecuting the main leaders and those of biggest responsibility for the crimes, but he has not said whether he will intend cases besides those four.
This not served of much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the means has been centered in IM Chaem, of 64 years, who was a head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Khmers at the end of the years 1970.
In 2007, she told him the investigators of the Center of Documentation of Cambodia that had supervised the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project in which it is thought that thousands of forced workers have died.
During a recent sultry afternoon, IM Chaem returned of working in the fields to its home on timber piles in a dirt track in the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dried-up pasture, IM Chaem refused to talk about its past in the Red Khmers.
It stated that if the court called for her she would not present herself.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," stated.
"If there are more processings, there will be war."
The First Minister Hun Sen, who deserted from the Red Khmers in 1978, has also noticed repeatedly that there will be instability if the court chases to more suspicious, although the experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past" stated.
But to confront the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, of the center of documentation.
The reconciliation, according to Khmer," is to join the broken pieces again "stated.
"It is our duty to bring together these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Khmers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the textbook of history of secondary school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in the oldest part of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details on the Red Khmers, in spite of the link of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student in the Secondary School of Anlong Veng, said that the new textbook helped the students to understand an important part of its history.
But its fathers reacted with scepticism when it took the book home to study.
"My family refuses many parts of the textbook and the court," stated.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure on the quantity of people that the court will process."
Such an endurance has made the process of reconciliation be complex and difficult, stated Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to cause an impact, stated.
Anyway, the Red Khmers keep a powerful charm here.
In the Mountains Dangrek, a path with too many weeds and piece of cutlery of discarded plastic bags it drives black covered by a rusty ceiling of tinplate to a rectangle of the soot.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a heap of tires after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a salesman of cellular at the edge of the path, said that it did not know a lot on the man that was cremado there.
"But it has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to say it," stated.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and latest that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where it would leave a bunch of ripe bananas with the expectation to have good luck.
Belorussia agrees to renouncing its reservation of qualified uranium for armament
In an unexpected victory for the campaign of the president Obama to protect the nuclear material in all the world, the government of Belorussia announced the Wednesday that, a critical component of the nuclear weapons, will renounce its reservation of highly enriched uranium.
The deal was revealed in a joint declaration published that the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Byelorussian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov, regardless of a summit of safety.
Per years, the American government had been trying to persuade Belorussia of he renouncing its highly enriched uranium and it seemed to a point without return that they had arrived last spring.
But the American civil servants told him the Washington post that were carried out a couple of operations classified with Belorussia in the two last months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of qualified uranium for armament of a Byelorussian installation of researches.
This prepared the ground for the agreement of the Wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a civil servant, that it talked from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear Safety of 47 nations presided over by Obama in April, which excluded Belorussia.
And apparently it was a good achievement to guarantee the invitation of the Soviet ex republic to the following summit in 2012.
"Really I felt fascinated because they wanted a place in the Summit of Nuclear Safety of 2012."
"This proves that this process is working," stated Ken Luongo, president of the Society for the Global Safety, a group that promotes the nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important crossing" given by Belorussia.
In April of 2009 Obama he promised in Prague to protect all the vulnerable nuclear material in all the world in the next four years.
Since then, the American government has helped to six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belorussia would be the seventh.
A dozen of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Summit of Nuclear Safety of Obama, the Byelorussian President, Alexander Lukashenko, he had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept the uranium highly enriched (hundreds of kilogrammes of what is basically qualified uranium for armament) and the uranium of low enrichment," stated Lukashenko in that moment.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to fabricate dirty bombs, and are not going to sell them to anybody."
"We use it with ends of research, is a totality."
However, Belorussia was approached to the United States some months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The civil servants stated that the first task of withdrawing the uranium of Belorussia, in October, was complicated particularly, since the material had been slightly irradiated.
The civil servants said that it was loaded in a special train that traveled more than 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the civil servants, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by airplane.
The American government used up 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belorussia with the installation of researches with uranium of low enrichment, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a civil servant of the Department of Energy that works in the Reduction of Global Threat, said that "this went coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen the confidence" that drove to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belorussia had at least 40 kilogrammes of qualified uranium for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium.
Belorussia will try to eliminate its reservation towards 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Belorussia and the United States have been tense per years, mainly due to the rough repression of Lukashenko of the human rights.
But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential distension.
It was declared that "while the progress is received willingly in these questions of global safety, the United States and Belorussia they recognized that a bigger respect for the democracy and the human rights in Belorussia keeps being a central subject to improve the bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA with prisoners Taliban and of Al Qaeda with address to Guantánamo for Spanish territory, as it expressed in a telegram the ambassador of US in Madrid.
Like this reflect it the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the journal El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive were informed "to be able to prove that they exerted an appropriate surveillance on the foreign airplanes that cross Spain."
In June 2006, after a report of the Board of Europe in the one that accused of complicity in practices contrary to the human rights to a dozen of countries, among them Spain, a meeting between the North American ex ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega took place.
The vice-president recognized that the report of the Board "had caught the Government of offside Shoemaker" and insisted in that Spain did not have anything to conceal in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain does not have objections to the flights of intelligence across Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid to "be caught unprepared," relates Aguirre in a cable.
Also the then headline of Exteriors, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, indicated to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give the possible lowest profile to this matter, although, when being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
For its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge of asking for the disqualification of the documents of the National Center of Intelligence (CNI) and of the Ministry of Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any incriminatorio element and any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking with the prosecutor.
However, US reflected its worry about the "visible coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors," more that for the information disqualified of the CNI or of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discretely among Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 in a lunch among the ambassador of US and the minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this commented it that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of its independence and will do that which consider adequate," he had given instructions to its collaborators "so that they avoided comments of rhetoric swollen up, in an attempt to reduce the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses its worry about the performance of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of its pro-American general direction, our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt to capitalize any indication that the Government of Shoemaker tolerated or deliberately ignored actions of US that they could be interpreted as possible rapes of the human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of US," indicates.

The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric proof.
The popular ones would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase of votes and representatives experimented in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has the sight put in the general ones then, there is advancement or not, the perspectives are more than prints, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the one that receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the general ones of 2008, whereas in the autonomous ones of 2006, the cipher rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384.091 votes.
Of this bullish tendency, which has been fed on a transfer of votes of the PSC and of the customer loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were celebrated, the PPC could pass of 8 to 12 representatives in the Congress being maintained, whereas CiU would gain also four (it now has 10) and the PSC would waste anything less than 9 representatives (it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan post is basic for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular ones, ERC would lose a representative - it now has three - whereas ICV would keep a representative or would gain one.
But, of maintaining the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will be produced in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular ones it can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relay at the front of the Regional Government of Barcelona, one of the administrations that budget handles more - 661 million euros for 2011.
So much nationalists as popular coincide in the possibility of the PSC wasting the town councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain majority or possibility to recur to its traditional members, ERC and ICV.
Once the republican disaster had been given, it would not be wild that this formation loses its representation in the Town Council from Barcelona - it is needed to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its cipher of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the lead in the overturn in the capital one from Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been situated only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were on several occasions.
The popular ones have grown also in other important municipalities as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated Al Qaida thousands of passports
Besides the seven ones stopped in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian stopped by agents of the General Police Station of Information of the Police in Barcelona formed a yihadista cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaida, among them "The Tigers for the Release of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and Laskar and Taiba (Let), author this last of the attacks of Bombay that caused the death to 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these researches, up to the point of assuring that with the "operation Kampai" it has remained "the device of forgery of Al Qaida weakened at international level and, therefore, its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and afterwards distributed to the groups that Al Qaida integrate the criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and of other occidental countries with total impunity.
The destamantelada cell is not the only one that the yihadista net had operative in Europe, it is for this reason that in the researches they have taken part, besides the Thai services, other European police units, for what is not discarded that in territory of the EU knocks similar to the one developed in the night of the last Tuesday in Barcelona are carried out on the next days.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung developed.
These were those that directed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan net - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports that they complied with with the requirements marked by the called "Islamic World Front" from tourists.
That is, the documents had to be to name of males of between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without you endorse crashed.
In means of the research it is underlined that, at the moment, it has not been found by any data that it links the arresteds in Catalonia to the attack of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, Laskar and Taiba, has been one of the receiver groups of the passports stolen in Spain and afterwards forged in Thailand.
However, it fits to remember that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent about a thousand dollars that "were invested" in the purchase of cards of mobiles that afterwards were used by the members of the "command" through an agency of transfers that it finished with the life of 106 people.
The Police have confiscated abundant documentation.
The PP requires to But that it puts the fiscal concert aside
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday of exposing it personally to Artur Mas its conditions to support its investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to the ones already suggested during the campaign and that are summarized in prioritizing the recovery of the economics and dispensing with adventures cutting edge-soberanistas, as it is the economic concert that the nationalistic leader wants to suggest in the equator of its mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the safety that gives to have obtained 18 representatives in the choices of the last Sunday, reckons more that sufficient to be made want, for the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exert the opposition to be abstained in the poll of investiture.
Of a possible entente with the PP the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are celebrated depend, but, at the moment, the conversations that these days maintains But with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all the soberanistas and secessionist speeches will have to be put aside," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Yes both leaders have in common its bet because the political device of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax of successions and donations loses weight.
Of the details of the negotiation on the investiture of But will be occupied, on the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But has already been met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - that it promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will make it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric one states that the deaths were not for "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not discard that its guard killed more than 11 elders
The ones responsible for the geriatric one La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused the institution the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the male nurse that while it was there used killed at least eleven elders that had to its charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the counselor of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire for La Caritat would be to be able to exert the accusation against the one responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility oblige us to assuming the procedural situation of responsible civilians."
And it is that besides the social disparagement that the entity can suffer because she has not detected in time the criminal activities of the guard, the great threat for La Caritat gains now form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the casualties are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that since then it has not stopped killing.
The judge already noted in the writ that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric one - that suspected that in many cases any doctor did not explore personally to the deceased ones but, attending to the age and to the pathologies of the patients, the formality by telephone was dispatched.
The Caritat, through its director, denied yesterday clearly this end and "the cause" noted that "the lack of measures can not have been in any moment of what it" has "passed."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the cause there is not a single indication that there has been an unwise action on the part of any other person that is not the imputed own one."
The one already baptized as "Angel of the Death" confessed 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed it on 29 of August 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case it provoked the death an overdose of insulin pricking it, unlike the first crime that committed it it being helped of a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of La Caritat notes that it is complicated to control that the staff of the center has access to the medicines.
The punctures of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the male nurse, in its eagerness to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But will be the analyses that those that will have to clarify are being done in the laboratory if Vila does not lie and searched for its first casualties a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, it burned them inside giving them bleach as already has confessed that it did with the three women that killed between 12 and 17 of October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the guard, even to the number of confessed murders, that they do not discard that or superior, and justify its attitude in the different versions that it has given Vila in its visits to the court and in the little felt one that it has that it changes its mode of proceeding after having committed, with success, eight murders.
It is because of that which they say that they put on availably of the justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The BCE threatens
The investors reacted brusquely yesterday to the threat yesterday of Trichet that it warned "the markets must not underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The differentials of peripherals have closed with force and the actions of the European banks have raised more of 5%.
However, we must hardly not underestimate either the capacity of the BCE of being mistaken and the euro has repuntado which is a worrisome signal.
What has been produced yesterday is characteristic of an ilíquido market that as collapses is recovered but motivated to by closing of short positions and very speculative.
It will take the institutional investor to lose the fear.
A month ago the BCE quoted us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to finish the plan of purchase of national debt for inefficient and to eliminate all the extraordinary measures from liquidity to deadline and leaving that was so single unlimited access at week.
After the Irish crisis we expect to defer the current measures of liquidity "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue with its program of purchase of bonds and even that they give the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not comply with the generated expectations they will return the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they follow blinded in withdrawing measures of liquidity, that God assists us!
As in its meeting of May in which they stated that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the history could tomorrow be repeated.
The BCE must be believable and persistent.
In May it announced the bazuca on Monday and on Wednesday said that it had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters at a year in Portugal has been poverty-stricken.
The Treasure alone emitted 500 million at 5,28%, versus 750 million at 4,81% of the previous auction.
Still like this the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in all the curve, reflecting clearly a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the ciphers of the hole of Allied and Bank of has been done public by Ireland.
The estimated ciphers are about 10.000 million short-term and another 15.000 potentials and they have until February to obtain private asset or they will remain nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the test of stress, the ciphers are assumable in the Plan of Help and help reduce the uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of its new budget and does not have sufficient support, therefore Ireland keeps being a focus of uncertainty, yet.
Angela Merkel has moderated the pitch of its speech to relax the tension in front to the next Summit of Heads of State and of Government on 14 of December in the one that a political appointment that proves that we are a union is necessary and that we all touch the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch to Wagner and to the rest the hymn of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift from the opportunity when presenting yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Reform of guesthouses, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measured to reactivate the employment are familiar in ears of the investors as the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bag has gone up 4,5%, the double that the rest of European Bags.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and of the Bank of Spain has been fast and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is an auction key of a bond at three years that will be seen Trichet benefited by the effect for what we wait for that is solved with strong demand and helps dissipate the doubts on our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Help would be a selfsacrifice.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasure have more than 40.000 million in available liquidity the triple that in March, to very expensive types and closes the access to the markets sine díe to you.
However, the strategy must keep being that of the woman of Caesar, "besides of to be it, to seem so."
Spirit, we can.
The president of Eulen will contest the board of Plain Sicilia asked for by its children
The storm does not die down in the conflict opened in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, when considering it "null of right plenary session," the judicial board of El Enebro of the 16th, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to do to cost its majority and to get of the organs of management of the titular firm of Plain Cellars Sicilia hold.
David Álvarez and its children Jesús David and María José are tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in its litigation by the control on behalf of the group.
The founder of the biggest holding company of business services to the company does not seem ready to yield in its litigation to be present in the government organs of El Enebro.
Of its board of directors it went dismounted for five of its seven children that were named administrators in the assembly of stockholders of 18 of January of this year and whose contestation is written down in the Business Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the 16th, called for by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunders in the bosom of the family Álvarez.
The resource to the judge to fix the assembly is the only legal mechanism that guarantees the call of the board, until the conflict is solved.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marten and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants its five children for, through procedural subtlety, in clear evasion of the law and abuse of right, to try to validate and to sanitate the radically null board of the 18 of January," according to its official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once the board celebrated, it proceeds to its contestation when considering that it is "null of right plenary session."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discrete silence, already tried without success that the magistrate called in June for a board.
In El Enebro, patrimonial and titular society of Plain Cellars Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the asset.
The founder of the group of services claims, however, the usufruct on 51% of the asset, according to the familiar protocols.
This matter is the underlying question that must decide the judge once is celebrated the sight on the demand for contestation, for which there is not indicated date yet.
Net Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in the cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of the speed has been marked by the surprise and by the success.
In a first moment nobody took the options of a newcomer motor-racing team in consideration and, in spite of the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the finishing straight of the championship they all bet for the triumph of the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without to be unworthy of the skill as I pilot of the finally champion, by the German Sebastian Vettel, not even either of the capacity of the engine Renault that propels its car, in the world of the Formula 1 the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to convert it into a winning equipment has been converted in a legend.
It is in fact a powerful software of simulation of processes that the German put in the market in 2007 with ends very far from the high automotive competition.
Once PLM Has Been Named, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing factories in all the world, plants of energy, instruments of high accuracy.
The goal is to reproduce, to simulate faithfully the product or the process before building it in a real way, preventing failures and avoidable expenses this way.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, of the airplanes of Sukhoi or of the most famous utilitarian cars of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible divisional industrialist of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its factory of Formula 1 has allowed Net Bull to design and to take to effect "in few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the careers and in the essays.
Russwurm explains that the motor-racing teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in its equipment that they were capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during every season.
In the equipment of Red Bull work today 180 professional youngsters of high qualification that, computer scientists equipped with powerful equipments, they analyze and project every kind of modifications in the racing cars.
The manager of Siemens explained that to the software PLM is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of the racing cars of Net Bull except for the engine, which is of the entire responsibility of Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the elements of safety are modified.
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production through laser and autoclaves of high technology.
The cipher of 40 million dollars that every equipment of Formula 1 can use up at the most in every season to facilitate the competence is as only limitation of this madness of the technological perfection.
Net Bull has set up the factory of high technology to design and to produce its racing cars in a locality at about 50 kilometers of London.
They are two buildings in which the visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
All what comes about there is considered "loudly secret."
The staff for this task promotes 580 people, once its two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber have been included.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Net Bull, undoubtedly, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energetic drinks has put in the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and its null fame are hidden.
The head of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, states that five years ago it could be stated that the advances of I+D in the cars of wagons provided 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots provide 15% of the markup.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer science since "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration are its member Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the net of 20 trades of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational foresees to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will already make compatible this initiative with the 16 areas present in multibrand centers as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put as example the remodeled store placed in the Great Way from Barcelona, estate of Pont Reyes, with the one who collaborates since 30 years ago.
The North American group has prepared a plan to place 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first in opening were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the week passed, the third being that of Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the following destination.
The also manageress of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be it, supporting in a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and it is in charge of the design furniture exclusive to the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
Besides, HP covers the formation of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a system of exemption and stood out that the net exclusive to trades intends to "improve the customer service and to the pymes in the purchase, the attention, the postsale and even the packaging."
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a pioneer pilo program at world level that it is in charge of solving the possible problems of the computer equipments of HP in accountability.
An online service connects technician placed in Maastricht (Holland) with a center.
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can settle problems that sometimes can take days up to two."
"This system is designed especially for pymes and users, since the big businesses already have hired services of technical assistance," highlighted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets because he 'robs' its competitors a million customers in three years
More optimistic that other managers, the managing director of Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking, but discards at first a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the war of the debit.
In spite of that, he foresees a collapse of the margins of interests, which will be tried to compensate partially with rises of commissions and of the price of the loan.
Sabadell expects to recruit in three years a million particular customers, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the three next years and to be able to survive like this in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will start off in 2011 a new directive plan that will have a validity of three years.
The goal, besides surviving without having to recur to the public helps of the FROB, is to gain market share with the collection of a million new particular customers -700.000 if those that can go out of the bank are taken away-, its great pending subject, since until now it had pampered the pymes and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has collected 250.000 particular customers and 50.000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is of 3,5%, whereas in companies it surpasses 10%.
Another of the bases of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet for the productivity, or what is the same of austerity, with cost reduction as goal, and whose challenges the bank will expose when he presents the trading results.
Few banks dare in these times some goals to be fixed and to make them public since the financial crisis has altered all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its directive plan Optima, fixed four years ago, although at first it was for three, but the situation of the markets did that an exercise will extend it more.
The customers that leave to escape the savings banks will be its main goal.
Guardiola insisted, on a breakfast organized by the APIE, in that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
In fact, the executive thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain will "be slow."
Besides, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment," a little basic for the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although he thinks that the war of the debit -that he penalizes the margins- is coming down, the price of the premiums for risk that banks are paying and boxes by its broadcasts to obtain liquidity are already being transferred to the price of the loan to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The subject of the liquidity and the financing is structural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the loan."
"We have not closed the faucet, but the differentials are higher," recognized Guardiola.
Banesto already gave on Thursday orders to its net so that they limit the long-term loan and raise the price of the differentials -to see CincoDías of the 22nd and the 27th of November-.
It also recognized that the trend of the banking now "is to go up commissions," but "there is a competitive frame."
The directive plan of Sabadell is based on the organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, it assures that in Spain "bigger sizes are going to be required."
"The year that comes totality is going to be moved," assured.
It states that the needs for asset are "raised very much" and it does not discard that some Spanish financial institution among in red numbers.
And notes that the FROB can replace to the market in the collection of backgrounds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the closing temporary of the markets, he subtracted importance to what some bankers already predict as a new crisis of liquidity.
It indicates that it can not be emitted, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which absorbs the crisis.
The MINT discards a second wave of merges in the boxes
The chief operating officer of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that a wave of merges of savings banks is going to be produced and the restructuring of the sector insisted again on the speed with which it is being executed.
When it started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, the entities that assured that they would not take part in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round were several.
However, the chief operating officer of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (MINT), José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to take place.
"I think that the biggest part of the merges has been done, by the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Civic Banking it can not be said that it is a second round, what there is are adjustments."
"The oldest part is completely made; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which in that has collaborated very much also," noted the manager.
In declarations during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the biggest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied of as it keeps being produced in the deadlines that then, not now, they were marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain, emphasized.
"To pass to 17 with 75.500 million of 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets is a process that does not have comparison in the history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much bigger to comply with Basilea," stood out.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a series of quite little fortunate opinions" "on the slowness of the process" that they prove "a lack of seriousness and of meaning," because "what does the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be in the deadline before end of year."
The chief operating officer of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who put it in cloth of judgment.
The manager noted that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of the financial institutions and of the boxes of saving, a system that has started a "very important" process of concentration and that "goes at the biggest possible speed."
Shutdown of the proofs of stress that the BCE carried out in July also remembered that the Spanish banking went out very well.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has opted to keep in the euro, but he has established the conditions for all the Union.
The tensions in the markets have provoked a double governmental answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new measures of adjustment, from fiscal reductions to the pymes, regulation of agencies deprived of placing or deletion of the 426 euros of help to stops without service, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
By another, the vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of the expresident Felipe González, has been added to the criticisms to the chancellor Angela Merkel by its responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How do those movements have to be interpreted?
It goes in front that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of nut in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what it must be its future, which it is startling with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its members.
In front of the European endurances, in Germany people start to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by it, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the frame, even if now science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, near to 50% of the population seems.
The third, one I redesign of the euro, in accordance with the Germanic proposals of biggest macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the transgressive countries, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and comes being defined since some time ago, so now there are not excuses.
First, in the 2009, when the FMI as well as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, a constitutional reform was taken out of the sleeve by the German Government to prevent them from the 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that people had to do (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in the public finances), and what its European members, included France, were practicing.
The second in the forehead the Central European country gave when Merkel prolonged distressingly the decision of rescue of Greece.
Already then it was object of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were very against the ransom of Greece.
Finally, on the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, requiring the reform of the treaties of the Union, to make the rescue of a country possible and, at the same time, to oblige to the private lenders to running with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and all the rest.
But its proposal, although one so much sweetened, has been passed and, in the next months, should attend the process of reform of the Union that makes those measures possible from the 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which he does not think to cross.
And is telling us to all that, even if now action has to be taken with those that perhaps does not agree a lot, from that date the old functioning of the euro, will have ended.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offender countries will severely be sanctioned, they can be obliged to breaking out in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is indicating us that we must follow a severe growth path with high rates of saving and inversion, moderation in the consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and positive exterior balances.
With enormous holes in the balance of payments, as the one that has presided over the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, they are simply not going to tolerate, another alternative based on the debt and the construction.
The push is clear.
And we would do badly in not understanding it.
It is not alone a matter of redriving the public deficit at 3% in the 2013.
What they require from us is much harder.
And as badly as in these circumstances we could do it is to trick ourselves.
I expect the current turbulences to leave crossing to a bigger calmness.
And that we make use of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of the 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero has also understood it like this and its double manifesto (the reforms engaged after the meeting of the last Saturday with the big businesses and the advertisement of yesterday of new measures) suggests that, in spite of the criticisms to Merkel, the thesis that order has to be put at home has made the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it does not seem that they are going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too much filled with little serious countries, can not be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and evasion of the law
Tricks as those of Alonso and Bouquets in front of the Ajax prove cleverness but not will of escaping to a sanction.
The ejection supposedly hatched by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match the 23 of November against the Ajax in the League of Champions disputed has provoked that rivers of ink are written about whether such a behavior is or not unsportsmanlike and if, eventually, both players had to be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As it is well known, for lack of some minutes to finish the match (that its equipment already had cattle clearly), both players wasted deliberately time at the time of taking their mistakes to provoke that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
That way, and since the Real Madrid will already finish as leader of its group, both players will comply with the statutory sanction the next match of the liguilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass free from cards the following phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned the implicated players with two matches to the coach of the equipment, José Mourinho, and with different economic quantities.
The provocation of a frequent yellow card in circumstances as this or similar ones is not a new practice, but rather in the world of the soccer.
It is so extended that it is part of the ethos, of the not written, but following rules, of this sport.
Part of the debate risen in the related case is due to in it having been played by an equipment of the entity of the Real Madrid (which in its hymn boasts about nobility and honor, and which on last occasions has fined its players for analogous acts) the lead and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, for Mourinho, the one who adds one more episode to its long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate turns around to if that type of behavior not forbidden expressly by the regulation contradicts the beginnings of the sport, that is, if with these actions evasion of the law is committed; for, in effect, they are respectful actions with the sport regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question passes because it examines the type of damage that they provoke to the sport spirit.
One of the goods that the sport spirit understands is the physical integrity of the contrary players, aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was not violent game.
Another of these goods that are referred to with the fair play is to avoid the equipment of the offender players taking advantage of unfair way of the contrary equipment, thing that did not happen either.
However, what is paradoxical of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it was not adapted to what normally we characterize as catch or evasion of the law, for its rape of the rules was not done secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most evident thing for like this to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and accepted the sanction gustosamente.
It is another question which type of advantage the offenders obtain in the examined intentional fouls.
Here it seems necessary to confirm that he does not place itself in disadvantageous situation to the competitor nor profit in the same match is obtained, for evidently the result of the action means leaving the equipment himself with less players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match either, for the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously consists in that the players will start the following phase of the League of Champions without cards that can threaten its participation in a divided future.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of lack of determination, for the first of change can have the equipment eliminated, and besides with this performance the players comply with a match of sanction and they pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards takes place with a less than in the first cycle.
So that, of keeping passing rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
All in all, those actions do not go against the sport spirit, of the one that yes is part to take strategic decisions that favor to take the maximum advantage of what the rules allow.
In the supposition that occupies us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (yes this would be a clear case of evasion of the law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They took a strategic decision without getting round the punishment nor avoiding it.
Although the border between the cleverness and the evasion of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think that it was a clear case of cleverness.
The controversy, seems me, rises up for two factors: because it was treated of two selfejections and for the way in which the transmission of the guideline of provoking them was carried out.
The induced damage to the beginnings of the sport by these actions is not ethical as well as esthetic.
Offensive of offers to collect the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
The celebrations selfpaid for by the employees, who want to use up between 20 and 30 euros, proliferate.
As the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December they also turn over the group dinners prior to Christmas, which keep working as oxygen cylinder for the restoration and the leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have flowed into an offensive of prices adjusted to be able to recruit the major customer: almost all want to use up between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or foods, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector had an interview.
To finish complicating the accounting, the calendar of this year (when the New Year's Eve on Friday falling) has concentrated the requests in the week of the 13 of December, with the result up to the date of an avalanche of reservations of dinners for peak days (on 16 and 17) and hardly movement for the previous week.
As he already comes happening from the 2008, when it started the stage of skinny cows, the companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary question are many.
Not to dispense with the tradition, many workers maintain it paying of its own pocket.
Or cual or the situation, some and others require prices of battle, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers, at day of today, does not dare to predict how they will be the feasts of this month.
"The people thinks it to himself a lot before reserving."
"It wants to go out but it has the crazy alerts in the subject of the prices," notes.
The business will go well "to the ones that give quality to good price and with good service," it adds, and it remembers that the customers tend to bring a step with the crisis down, so the strip about the 25 euros has turned in major into the demand.
In a survey in different centric establishments the collapse of requests is confirmed for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretension of using up less than 30 euros, to which they have answered adapting its menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 at 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostel of the Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has entailed more anticipated reservation, even from beginnings of November.
"We have done what is impossible to maintain the same prices of the last year, with menus for all the tastes from 19,95 up to 30 euros," detail.
In AN Grup, which registers El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and total of 23 sites up to one, are maintained optimistic after detecting an apogee of the invoicing since the second semester and some good, although, perspectives of business for Christmas, concentrated.
Fountains of the group stand out that on 18 also will be a hyperactive day as for peer groups that precelebrate the holidays.
To its six menus of group have added Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as star budget and the perception that there is predisposition to use up 10% more than the year passed in exchange for requiring more details, as cava.
They also see green buds in some companies that invite its employees again and sensation that the volume of the groups is a little big.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (that it includes entities as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, counts on starting to see the end of the tunnel and holds that as a whole the reservations are "cheered" up, although the customers "negotiate to the utmost."
That yes, the illusion about the feasts has not gone down, whoever pays, indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great unrest in US
Islamabad causes atomic weapons "to a rhythm faster than any other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the links between Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of US filtered by the doorway Wikileaks confirms the enormous unrests that the Pakistani nuclear program provokes in Washington.
Regardless of the esclarecedores and juicy details that offer on the contents of the conversations and the thoughts of the representatives diplomats official North Americans in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries on the subject of atomic safety, instead of going in increase, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a rhythm faster than any other country of the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to obstruct its destruction in the event of attack-- it constitutes one of the main reasons of sleeplessness in Washington.
Like this enumerates it the ambassadress in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then adviser of National Safety, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear facilities to low territory attacks Taliban, the rumored dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and in the programs of missiles is contemplated, not already alone for US, but also for Russia, as proliferante and motif to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; the fall of the educational levels given and cultural, the extremist organizations have more opportunities of recruiting people that works in the nuclear programs or of missiles," the expert said Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Exteriors, in a meeting with its American counterparts.
The newest thing of the documentation filtered by the doorway of Julian Assange is the every time smaller cooperation among US and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rhythm of production of nuclear weapons.
An office of the embassy in May sustains, which qualifies of "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan: "The transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain without answer or are "discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan causes nuclear weapons" to a rhythm faster than any other country of the world."
The ambassadress Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit of the head of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" the responsible one that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the head of Wikileaks
Obama names to one loudly responsible for the antiterrorist fight to prevent new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
All what is related with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emitted a "red alert" "to locate and to follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional capias.
Besides, it is not new, but it dates from the 20th of November.
And does not have to do with the last filtration of more than one quarter of million of diplomatic documents of US but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian confronts in Sweden.
Besides, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know how where and how to set in contact with Mr. Assange."
It was on the 20th when the international police service with headquarters in Lyón (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not reveal until yesterday, after receiving authorization of the authorities of that country.
Like this the things, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating to Assange "with a view to its temporary arrest and extradition."
Although the Interpol can not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as it has explained the organization, yes consider the called net free way notice to proceed to an arrest --which must undertake the national body of police-, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where it thinks that Assange is.
The movement has angered the lawyers of Assange, which yesterday published a card reporting that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has appeared ready to answer to the questions of the Swedish authorities for video conference.
They remember that Assange requested and obtained license for going out from Sweden of the prosecutor of its case, who they compare Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of safety of Stalin, to with the mythical one, also.
"This seems a hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world looks -and from Australia its mother defends the innocence of its son- for it - Assange continues in unknown, but not silenced whereabouts.
On Monday granted from an indeterminate place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the State secretary of US, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible of ordering to American diplomats that spied in the UN violating international treaties that US has signed, should resign," said.
Its opinion was insulted yesterday by the secretary of press of the White Home, Robert Gibbs, that qualified of "ridiculous and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am not in a complete way sure why it must import us the opinion of a type with a web page," declared to the chain CNN.
The Obama itself has ordered to one loudly responsible for the antiterrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new escapes of documents.
The attempt at the spokesman of the president Barack Obama of taking importance away from Assange contrasts with opinions that these days they proclaim politicians and preserving commentators.
Peter King, the congress man that from January will preside the Committee of National Safety in the Lower House, has asked to the Department of State that studies the possibility to include to Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to take part and its backgrounds and to chase to any that he of any contribution or help."
Further Tom Flanagan, an advisor of the Canadian president Stephen Harper has still gone, that it has had to withdraw after saying that Assange should "be murdered."
"Obama should convert it into goal and use a not manned airplane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptista minister, exgovernor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"The one who is in the Government the one that filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be a too nice punishment," testified in the chain Fox.
Puigcercós looks for the peace in ERC with winks to the similar ones to Carod
The republican leader will allow the match a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet suggests a more plural executive committee and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to get round the nth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the leak of 11 representatives and half of the votes.
The president of the match is conscious that its threat of resignation is insufficient for the similar ones to the exleader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as its own mentor and that it can not cause him at all the worries that it had with other extinct currents.
Because of that, the leader of Esquerra will try to get round the new reviewers with winks that allow him to be armored up to the council elections.
To start, Puigcercós announced that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to pronounce themselves on its continuity in secret yesterday.
Through ballot papers, and not by hand raised.
If the carodistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to make it without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to its person.
In several interviews, one of the votes stated that it would not be considered ratified with the half more, but it added, without needing percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The ones close to Carod require something else its charge to put availably of the militancy, a gesture that it does not cost when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ among congresses, from the president.
But as it does not have the sufficient majority to force resignations, they are going to try to grant a waybill here to May with the executive committee.
For that, they expect to share in the elaboration of the document strategic redirection that the address will submit to poll of the national board on the 18th.
Its intention is to answer for Puigcercós in exchange for this promising to advance the congress to fall of the 2011, something that the dome already gives for made one.
The leader of ERC recognized that the "polyphony" damages the stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, be capable of washing the dirty rags of doors inward.
In this line, the article is symptomatic that the acting conseller Josep Huguet signed in its blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovació considered done that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for different goals."
And he enumerated five, from which they send two.
The first, "to recompose" the executive committee so that it means at least to 90% of the militancy, that is, including new faces that originate from the similar sector to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet suggests that ERC liquidate in one go the asambleísmo as mechanism of functioning.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statues that it allows celebrating the congresses through delegates chosen by suffrage.
To finish, an exception in the Spanish system of matches, with the assembly model has been an obsession of the equipment of Puigcercós, which already battled in this sense in the two last congresses.
In fact, the troubled conclave of the 2008 left the assignment to the address of revising the asambleísmo in a congress specific to reform of statues.
This appointment is still pending, for the internal tide of the last years advised against confronting the matter.
Now, without critical sectors on the watch, can be a good moment to take up it and to try to close it forever.

In interview prior to the socket of protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, it said that in any case the ejection of Espino is a decision adopted in the local area.
It "is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has its law of going, in its case, claim way to the Commission of Order of the National Board, in such a way that it is a taken decision in the area of a competent organ," wrote down.
On the other hand, it clarified that it is not time of thinking about 2012 and that an alliance was never in the table of negotiation for the presidential candidacy.
Coomb Vázquez was said convinced that National Action will go out strengthened of the internal choice of the 4 and 5 of December, in which its successor will have to be chosen.
"That (an alliance in the 2012) is a subject that was never in the table of negotiation, at least not for now, was an approach for the local choice that was successful and complied the goal," referred.
The panista leader needed that to the BREAD back up it 71 years of dialogue, for what "the internal competence does not frighten us; to the contario "we enjoy it and strengthens us," marked out.
It said that undoubtedly the board will know how to choose to the best or to the best leader that requires National Action for the following three years, it is for this reason that it will deliver the post "to the one who the board determines."
"I have that absolute calmness and opens, to any of the five would be proud of delivering the office of the president of the match to her."

He promotes Obama in law Twitter in favor of students with no identity papers
"If you coincide that approving the law Dream Act is what is appropriate, calls to your senators and tell them to pass is legislation," tweeteó the estadunidense president in the popular social net.
The president Barack Obama joined today the national mobilization in support to the law Dream Act, to legalize students with no identity papers, with a message in its personal account of the social net Twitter.
"If you coincide that approving the law Dream Act is what is appropriate, calls to your senators and tell them to pass is legislation," tweeteó Obama.
Its brief message maintains to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent, a cybernetic link with a more detailed document that it asks the public for opened.
"With a vote that is waited for it happens soon, now it is the moment of doing that" is "listened" to by your voice, indicates.
The message was spread afterwards that the 42 republican senators threatened with blocking the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the tax cutbacks of the era Bush and the financing of the government is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a card signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the law Dream Act and of other projects as the ratification of the new treaty START with Russia against the proliferation of weapons nuclear.
Questioned by the republican blockade to the law Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal subject solved, a calendar will be able to be fixed for the rest of the projects.
"I think that there is a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the fiscal matter before of end of year..."
"I think that we can achieve an agreement in some moment in that and we can plan the scene of the rest afterwards," said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced the Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote of closing of debate" for the law Dream Act, therefore the initiative to legalize students with no identity papers could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more probable next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or law of the American Dream would legalize to about 800 a thousand youngsters that deposited to United States before the 16 years, have remained in the country the last five years and deposited an institution of superior education or the army.
But the partisans require 60 votes to approve the initiative, therefore they require the competition of a handful of republicans, in moments that organizations in favor of the project play the lead an intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the law.
The democrats, most of whom it supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, the senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said that it will vote against, and only one republican has expressed its support to the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
Because of that, the partisans of the Dream Act require to add several republicans if other democrats decide to turn on the initiative.
Among the most courted republicans the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, like this as the overhanging senator George Lemieux are, of Flowery, the one who completed the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have declared that they will not back it up on another occasion.
Another republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined its posture now.
Although the Camera of Representatives has a different version, analysts coincide that the Dream Act confronts the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger in the ulcer
The second round of Los pleasures of the language was an avenue where the participants did soiree of the narration
"That of El sex in the language I understand it but... the finger in the ulcer? what is waited of me?," the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Los inquired into pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates to the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of its question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to El sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the ulcer... "it puts us in difficulties," the Argentinian writer skewered sweetly the public, mostly of youngsters, which were given by appointment in the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define afterwards as a big story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist that in search of the to know which is the "ulcer," goes of doctor in doctor, of those that does not obtain answers although yes tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectólogo it goes out convinced: "the patience is not my fort, perhaps it is my ulcer."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the orthopedic surgeon that has stolen it the breath in half of the corridor, but who clarifies it that ulcer is not a scientific term; he is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the ulcer is what is real open, what is symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the ulcer I only managed to know that is what is real open and that" does not "exist," but convinced that the pleasures and the catches of the language must go very entreverados.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narration that he titled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the ulcer is not named but in a moment is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it has of a famous wizard, that the same touched clouds, brought of turn to men that had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maid had lost, narration that put about to talk afterwards America, the big novel to which its own chroniclers that had it did not miss it from the beginning and the one who criticizes the excesses of has been said by the conquering captains quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo.
"Cervantes that it invented us to all (the writers) did mockery of the feigned witnesses that appeared in the histories presented as real, but in another way ever had gotten to be had the history of America with imagination that lacked it up to the modesty."
However, it stood out "are the mad people and the liars the that better imagine" and is where it converges reality and lie, where it is not known any longer that of has been told it belongs to an edict or to another, where the literature of fiction reaches its apogee.
He calls it in fact the "cervantina tradition'.
"For inheritance of his we are what is said."
In its turn, the writer Mayra Montero marked out and El finger applauded the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the FIL with its round table gave rise to in the ulcer.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed his towards the big ulcer of the social violence that crosses its country -and she shares Latin America- product of the disputes of the traffic and sale of drugs.
"I believe that the good literature, the good poem, the good songs contain a tacit appointment that of course" is not "planned," indicated, after mentioning that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the appointment that settles between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last.
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also did emphasis "of that finger in the ulcer of the compromising writer of the writer" closed the night.
It considered that in a world that lives to haste, also in the intellectual habits and control of the consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every assertion there is one small not and behind every negation there is one small yes."
"To be owners of our thought and to be owners of the reality we have to change slightly: and to change slightly means many times putting the finger in the ulcer and bothering to those people that are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, blank and black, in ideas established and without nuance and to bother also the powers that prefer a blank world and black," said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for its first bond
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in ends, has had up and downs in its career, but the decisive series has known how already to reach on three occasions.
With the duel of Saints Laguna and Monterrey in the end, besides two different styles marked by its technicians, who find among themselves with a contrast marked by the results, are confronted.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in ends, has had up and downs in its career, but the decisive series has known how already to reach on three occasions, although until now it has left blank and it is because of what this occasion is very special for it.
The Argentine has ended up being comforted with the medal of the runner up, a crossing behind has been kept of the winners and curiously with a same equipment has played consecutive ends.
The santista strategist arrived at its first end as coach in the Competition Opening 2002, when it took the reins of the Morelia with which it fell for global of 4-2 in front of Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 it also arrived to the decisive duel and also lost it with global of 3-1 and was precisely in the face of Rayados.
Already with Saints Gap, in the Bicentenary Competition 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén suffered again a backhand, since its equipment finished 2-2 drawn in front of the choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of pénaltis was put in advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the bond for finally three players of his failed from the 11 crossings and suffered the somersault 4-3.
Rubén already lost two ends with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, its competitor in turn, therefore does not want to run the same luck, looks for being detached of the curse and being able to celebrate a bond for first occasion, although it states that for it the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an interest to which I owe myself and for consequence will come the bond for my, but the previous is the most important thing," commented the steerman when it questioned it to himself about the numbers that has against ends playing.
Very current has the previous end, of which, it assures, has learned a lot, "the only teaching that we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the stripe, we, the players, also because the previous time, with two penitentiaries for already throwing we were prepared to go out running and I think that that is a teaching, until the match is not finished can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that does not worry it, for it trusts its players: "One never looks for arriving to the series of penitentiaries, one looks for finishing in regular time, but sometimes there is not of another and has to be prepared, in the previous competition we were prepared, unfortunately did us a bad move the destination, sometimes for the nerves or the anxiety of having the bond in the hands, but left us, that left us something for this end that we wait for not arrives to that application."
Romano has in its hands to stop being a runner up technician and to prove for the first time the glory that they give the bonds.

The National Administration for the Aeronautics and the Space (NASA) of United States it will give to know morning, Thursday, an astrobiológico discovery, that could prove the theory that yes there is extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday to the hours 13:00 in the headquarters of the NASA in Washington for expert in astrobiología, science described as the person in charge to study the origin, evolution, distribution and future of the life in the Universe.
When mentioning to the press, the NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will cause impact in the search of extraterrestrial life," which sparked off speculations of experts of other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures ours at par and in hostile atmospheres that were thought uninhabitable, and would put in the table the possibility of their being converted in intelligent beings as the human beings if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Monkey Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, where he lives in an atmosphere that was thought too poisonous for any living, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of surviving and of this capacity she increases the possibility of similar life being able to exist in other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiólogos, if these organisms use the arsenic in its metabolism, it will remain it proved that "yes there is another living, a second living, different to the one that we know."
The space agency will introduce the real scope of the findings in the press conference of tomorrow Thursday.
In the conference will take part the geobióloga Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the biggest moon of Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Exploit PRD, PT, Convergence and opposing Boss 'block'
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, gives rise to the arrive of the 'bipartism', denounce.
It was not installed the 60 Legislastura when in the Congress an opposing block, led by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who was declared independent, rose, and the four questioned a thing: the arrival of the 'bipartism' to the Camera.

Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally the political marginalization is constituted on behalf of the PRI and BREAD.
It detailed that on the next days they will talk with the representatives of the BREAD and PRI to modify the schema, setting off of a political will, and if do not have it, they will then be subjugated again by both matches and with that the opposing coalition ran out.
"Up to here it arrived (the opposing coalition), is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, nor siquieran have the political deference of considering the opinion of the rest."

It can not be allowed, pursued, that the Congress after having been monopólico, now it is "duopólico."
"An eternal bipatidismo is not the spirit to the reform to the law that there is in the Congress."

The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: The 24th of September, two of the 15th of October, the 19th of October, the 29th of October and this last one, of the 16th of November.
Although the supplier has not been published in the Official Journal of the State yet, as marks it the Law when a company is questioned for SEIZES it, in order to avoid other governments using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The previous, after which on the 25th of July, Northwest published a revision to the checks that the Town Council to its suppliers dispatches, in which it was revealed that, of March of the 2008 to the 9th of July of the 2010, in the triennium of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where he charged checks for more than 3 million pesos.
They are urgent to attend to touristic places
Touristic businessmen regret accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Bower Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a collapse of the Bower Sánchez Taboada, the touristic sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and places that they find in bad state and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Area, remembered that on different occasions they have reported that care is taken of the image of the destination and to return how bad find the tourists with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the stools has affected the near businesses because the tourists come to walk and see the disorder and take the turn out for him.
"The politicians do not know what is to close a day a company and do not have idea about the fortune that is lost, or otherwise the works did not act as this form in so much time and without the appropriate gliding."
The hotel manager José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and to avoid his passing again, how to do it then giving preventive maintenance and not to fall only in what is corrective," expressed.
"We are anxious to enjoy a clean city, because that because because only it is touristic area the maintenance must occur, but as inhabitants that we deserve a clean place to live and the Town Council must change its strategy to maintain well to the city."
There are other places that also exhibit careless and incomplete, said, as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, so that it comes the tourist does not depend only on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, in its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the touristic appeals," said.
"The appropriate attention has not been given and this type of facts puts in evidence something that is notorious for all, the maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Touristic Promotion, expressed that the ransom of touristic places of Mazatlán is urgent, use is then not made of them correctly and they project a bad image.
It talked about a series of places that must set in line as a whole with the municipality and be priority to have the city to the day, cleaning, tidy and that is attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many places and historical and cultural places that will have to be ordered first, be cleaned and us be put in line to do them attractive to be able to add them in the inventory that we have to promote the destination."
IP asks for results to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, suggested that the representatives assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the different challenges that it confronts.
A Legislature of work worthy and free from agreements among matches and from the state Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that confronts great issues.
From yesterday it remained the 60 installed legislature, integrated by seven political forces, 19 representatives of the PRI, 13 of the BREAD, three of the Match New Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, who adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the listing of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean management and of appointment with the society and with the different sectors that require from a legislative work responsible and that is not repeated the same bosses of the partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Coordinator Business Board, suggested that the 40 representatives of the Congress of the State newly used for the first time assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the different challenges that it confronts.
"We expect the representatives really to exert its law, free from agreements among the matches because it is a habit that hotfixes for velar do for the own interests and are converted in carnavaleras groups of the rulers and of the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
It is for this reason that it talked about their certifying the appointment to establish the necessary bridges that they go off the Ruler in turn.
"Ocupamos that they avenge to do a worthy work and especially committed themselves with the society and with the sectors because they were the sinaloenses that gave them the vote of confidence in the last choices."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is that of pushing and adding forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push the economic growth, that they generate incentives for the inversion and infrastructure and that in some way will encourage the generation of employments."
As for the touristic activity, it sued that the new legislators give the Secretary of state Tourism the peso that reviews in the state budget to strengthen.
"I have industry it understood that it is the second Secretariat in the state with smallest budget and is incongruous as important and generating economic activity of exchanges and inversion and that competes with the agro directly."
Besides it being required to label resources to detonating touristic projects and their contributing to giving the state safety and to the update to the Law of Alcohols that they have not been able to solve in previous legislatures.
A magician king is looked for
Dolls, carts and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing for the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For its fathers, the next Day of Kings it will be difficult to please its illusions, since its home is formed for nothing else and not at all less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not waste the expectation that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar give away them the toys and the clothes that so much want.

Fourteen supposed arrested drugs traders
On Wednesday, in Estrie, ten persecutions within the framework of the dismantling of a net of production and sale of Cannabis have been carried out.
Fourteen people who will face different accusations have been arrested.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
"About 750 plants of Cannabis have been confiscated, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined to the production," Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Safety of Quebec, points.
In total, they have been two men of Sherbrooke eleven men and three women arrested, once the two leading suppositions of the net have been included.
The persons under arrest had to appear in the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the following hours to its arrest.
They could be confronted with the accusations of production of Cannabis, possession with the aim of, conspiracy and theft of services, to deal among others.
These persecutions there are been produced after a long research that has lasted nearly one year.
"It has been the information provided by the public the one that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," needs Mr. Ruel.
In this operation policial took part about seventy agents of the module of research of Estrie de la Seguridad of Quebec, of the Service of police of Sherbrooke and of the Department of policeman Memphrémagog.
People will be able to fight against the troublefree clandestine migration
The bill of the conservatives who, as the Government, should solve the problem of the boats full of clandestine migrantes ones, probably will be confronted with a big opposition, since the three opposition camps have announced the Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I base mainly in the Card."
"I find here with a match that has created the granite that you tread on," the liberal leader declared Michael Ignatieff, surrounded with the representatives after the celebration of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals defend that the bill in its current form, that would allow it to come from a ship identified as transport of clandestine immigrants, infringes the Canadian Card of laws and freedoms to stop year up to one to any person.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, indicated likewise that it could not back up the bill because it notes to the white wrong.
"We are against and, as it seems, all the opposition camps are against the project, so we will already see what does the Government," Mr. Duceppe testified.
The criticism of the NPD on the subject of immigration, Olivia Chow, has refused of a stroke the criticisms that indicate that its match is not firm enough with the clandestine immigrants.
"The neodemócratas agree with measures against the persons in charge of the boats of clandestine being adopted and that is what we aim for with another bill, the C-35," indicates Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the conservatives because it attacks the refugees and it imprisons the children during a minimum of a year," explains Mrs. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the matches of the position of playing politicians and of paying attention of the will of the Canadians neglectful.
"The great majority of the Canadians tells to the representatives that do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they deal to the country as if it were a doormat."
"Some firm measures expect Canada to adopt," the Minister Kenney gives an opinion.
The Government has not announced a poll of confidence on its bill, what it could take to the country to some choices as consequence of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the Agency QMI that the Government was going to request the celebration of a poll so that every representative who is going to oppose explains himself afterwards before its electors.
The new unit does not obtain the unanimity
Even though the possible creation of a permanent unit of fight against the corruption and the collusion for Jean Charest had been announced, numerous observers keep asking for the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the question.
The Minister of the Law and Order, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been posed two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is question since January of the last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against the corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the advertisement of Tuesday has caught more than one candid.
One may say that, during a meeting of the permanent Board on the police services of Quebec held on the 29th of October, this measure was never discussed in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was sufficient so that the reviewer of the quebequense match that treats the question of the law and order, Stéphane Bergeron, qualified this advertisement as "a taken rabbit of the top hat" and as "a last minute careless solution."
The Minister Dutil, on its part, has answered to those who fear the political power having influence on the possible future unit too much.
"You will see the results when we announce it," indicates simply.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is not at all that it can replace the launch of a public enquiry.
"As much as Mr. Charest persists more in avoiding the creation of this commission of investigation, more people share our opinion, that is, that has to hide" something, explains.
"The only mode of having a commission of investigation is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and government of the national School of public administration.
To go out from this neutral gear, it suggests to Quebec that it grants a special mandate to the general inspector so that he carries out an enquiry on the collusion and the corruption.
"We must be capable of extending the mandate of the general inspector," concludes.
Likewise, it considers that Quebec could grant the same competences to the inspector as to a commissioner, it allowing him like this the people to testify to oblige.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only potential project in the Government Charest.
Quebec requests likewise from Ottawa that it modify the Criminal Code so that he adapts better to this type of crime.
This application seems to come from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of researches.
The federal Minister of the Law and Order, Vic Toews, has confirmed for its part that its counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, inclines at present because he carries out certain amendments in relation to this subject.
During the operation Primavera 2001 related to the groups of moteros, even if the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa gave impulse to the adoption of the Law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Different courses of water are being supervised from near due to the strong precipitations that have been registered in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday a slipping took place in the afternoon in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As preventive measure, two homes have been evacuated.
At night, another slipping took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday at night, different regions registered some strong precipitations, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Likewise, between 20 and 40 additional millimeters since now until Thursday are waited for at night, according to the region.
The sectors situated in the north of the river and in the valley of the Outaouais were the most affected.
They could receive total of 100 millimeters of rain up to one.
Since these precipitations are added to the thaw of the snow that had already piled up in specific sectors, different rivers overflowing is feared.
On Wednesday at night, the unit of civil Safety of Quebec emitted alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already provoked floodings in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, the strong precipitations have provoked that some lakes were overflowed with in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-of-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As measure of prevention, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of specific lakes has provoked the closing of several ways, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The unit of civil Safety continues in alert and supervises the situation near, as it has indicated Annik Bouchard, adviser of safety.
The Center of forecast of the rises of Quebec, on its part, emitted on Wednesday advertisements communicating the strong rises of several rivers, particularly the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They blame partially Dupont
The presenter of radius of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain backhand before the Canadian Board of the norms of the radio and television (CCNR) for some controversial declarations in relation to the social assistance and on the Haitians, as well as for its rude language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and its equipment of CHOI 98,1 FM had the law of expressing its opinion, but specific declarations contained "inaccurate information on the social assistance, an improperly negative representation of the Haitians and rude language that should not be used in the spread broadcasts during the day."
The Board has indicated likewise that the debates on the suicide, including the popularization of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe the codes on the broadcast.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the comments done in broadcasts spread among 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was emitted after a complaint of the common Front of people who receive social assistance of Quebec.
The group complained about the amounts mentioned in the broadcast not being correct.
The presenters must communicate reliable data and not that they drive to deceit.
In relation to the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had declared that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most of the members of the Committee have arrived to the conclusion that the transmitted message was that the suicide as a solution to the problems of the life should not be considered.
"The majority of the Committee considers that" the episodes questioned of "Dupont him midi" have dealt a delicate subject in an equitative and adequate way. "
Therefore, about this any fault has been discarded.
The last litigation referred to the declarations carried out after the earthquake of Haiti.
In that moment, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort they had played the lead in a media confrontation that had sparked off numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI declared that he had not carried out any donation to help the Haitians because he could not know with safety whether the needy persons were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers it refusal of the Haitians that these comments are not abusive, but that its accumulative effect constitutes a representation improperly.
I have already complied with my suspension of three days there above."
"My dossier is clean since it does a year and a half," the presenter testified.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the broadcast of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated "even more of what has been "required."
The consequences will be minimum for the broadcasting station, which will have to announce, among other things, the decisions once in the hours of biggest audience in a deadline of three days.
A king of the kung-fu in Montreal
The montrealés of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and box thai, goes up to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts as the kung-fu and the kickboxing 12 years, in Algeria, ago" explained Zemmal, which lives in the metropolis since 2008 to advance in the professional level.
"In my case, I look for combats everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy themselves with the game on the ground that the mixed martial arts imply, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, which works as agent of safety and as employee of the company UPS, it has given recently bad news to its competitors, gaining two gold medals in the Championship of the amateurish World of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), celebrated of the 23 to the 30 of October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have improved on the categories of kickboxing full contact and of box thai," explained.
"At present I prepare to take part in the Glass of the World of san shou in China."
"They will invite the sportsmen who have finished among the four first posts in the last championship of the world in every category."
"In 2009, I gained the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in the eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the competition in fifth post, but I reached the third post in Toronto in 2009," added.
"What is interesting is that I have kept progressing in every competition."
"To this crossing, I will be the first this time or the year that comes!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native of China the opponents to the ground are allowed in which to knock with the cuffs and the feet, as well as to throw to.
The confrontations originally are celebrated on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of the martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal so alone must maintain a competition in its career, undoubtedly it will go to the great competition "King of Sanda," the super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and most prestigious of China," explains the nice boy.
It "is as the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand) ."
"It has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has gained its first combat, in the semifinals of its category (80 kg), but he lost in the end.
"The one that has gained me is a real professional," gives an opinion.
"There are four competitors for category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are confronted in the end of its category."
"Next, the champions of every category are confronted to crown only one champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without bids
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts for a value of 450 million dollars to companies of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the center of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts that of management of the project, by an addition of 295 million, finds a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained the most important contract without a previous bid.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision of Hydro-Québec of entrusting its responsibility of managing this important hydroelectric project of 5.000 million dollars to the private sector.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Énergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a competitive bidding being carried out previously.
For the quebequense Match, the resource to consortiums of companies poses a severe ethical problem he threatens with which eliminating the competence and provoking a rise of the prices.
People "are about a new method of collusion and about eliminating the competence."
"That is, the people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly, the representative of the Match quebequense Sylvain Simard testified yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard posed the question in the national Assembly because, as it states, it does not understand how the public interest can be benefited this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, answered in the afternoon, denying firmly that a collusion with this contract has taken place.
"Empiezo to to tire me," protested, defending that the PQ had acted as "dishonest" mode and "with lack of rigor."
It indicated that "what was minimum" would be that the PQ apologized.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice in the entire world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or several companies to group together its knowledge to answer to a bid for a complex project.
The project Eastmain presents a high level of complexity, taking the magnitude of the works into account.
The works have already started and will last up to 2012.
In all the case, the contract has been granted without the competence coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
Besides, the formula of the consortiums has stopped being the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As he published last week Le Devoir, the formula of the consortiums in the sector of the technical advice is being submitted to a research in the Government.
A fast look to the business register of Quebec allows identifying more than 200 consortiums, of which some seem permanent.
This way, the company Dessau works in association with most of its main competitors, as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Every combination, and there are tens of them, drives to only one legal person, that is, Dessau.
As for the consortium Énergie gérance, the Minister Normandeau has stood out that "the territory of the Bahía James answers to a dynamics of particular manpower and Hydro-Québec answers it specifically since the years 1970."
The big head of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie of the Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the management contract of the project has been granted directly.
"If you answer to a bid and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in contact with the actors of the sector and tell to them: we are going to negotiate an agreement satisfactory and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what imports is not the price, but the competence of the people," indicated Mr. Laporte.
The contract Énergie gérance granted to the consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50.000 dollars obtained by the quebequense Match.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the checking, Le Devoir has identified 109 contracts of technical advice granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or to its subsidiaries, particularly geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking its participation in Énergie gérance into account.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, they promote 449.783.344 dollars, once the contract of Énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars has been included.
Sylvain Simard has given that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau has let fall that the PQ is also linked to these companies, that the "finance," before needing it to rather be about its leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
The quebequense consumer hardly trusts the actors of the sustainable development, as well as the brands of trade exactly even in the ecological certificates to guide its choices.
According to the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is still worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe for where messages swarm that defend a more responsible consumption, but he regrets the lack of reliable information and it is considered its appointment that this even stops.
Even if it has increased the consumption of the products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the quebequenses seem to give very few loan to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental appointment of the companies or the publicity ecologists of them, reveals the tool of measurement elaborated through the Observatory of the consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers questions the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called just, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that take labels indicating that are "ecorresponsables," indicates the Barometer.
In the same way, only 14,6% of the quebequenses takes seriously the speeches of the politicians on this question.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of the consumption, sustained at present by nearly one third of the quebequenses consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the doubtful character of the information make 46% of the consumers discard this option.
It is about the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the price highest of these products.
Besides, a third of the quebequenses they say to mistrust also the supposed yields of the products or ecological services that it is tried for them to sell.
On the other hand, practically half of the consumers changed its habits into 2010 and, especially, she changed the brand of one or several products to respect its convictions.
61% has prioritized the purchases in the stores of its neighborhood and has preferred buying food products cultivated in its region, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and responsible (the index of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of a hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec adores occupying the post of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social conscience seems to be of doors (of its car) outside: in 2010, so alone 28% of the quebequenses indicated that it has used the public transportation or have shared car to defend its environmental beginnings.
Besides, 39,1% of the participants of this detailed enquiry of behavior, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and the displacements on foot.
A loan so that the State recovers eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to the one that have asked that it be jeopardized financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas eXcentris post the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborating, but only through a loan.
The Société of développement Angus and the Parallèle, that waited for a donation of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris again in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and to return it its real vocation cinemagoer, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to implicating itself in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec suggests a loan whose amount it would be, in fact, inferior to the initial expectations; this could constitute a feasible solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the view of specific public employees.
Quebec had already refused last spring a first plan of action and an application for 12,8 million, but the applications have been revised since then downward.
The president of the Société of développement you give entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the dossier of eXcentris, sent a proposal and a plan of action To the Minister St-Pierre.
He has sent him a last report ten days ago.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal of the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have of deadline up to the 31 of December to answer to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation of the State must completely be discarded.
Let's remember that the Association of owners of rooms of cinema and cinematographic complexes of Quebec was opposed to a direct inversion of the State to back the recovery of eXcentris up, arguing that the Ministry of Culture must not finance property projects, since he has not made it with other rooms of cinema.
Yes, on the other hand, different representatives of the sector claim a considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of it, has taken for ten years the burden of the cinema of author in its sites of the complex, after financing its own construction, what could justify a derogation on the part of the Board of the Treasure.
The lack of rooms for independent films is obvious in Montreal and eXcentris had known fidelizar to its clients.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, give impulse for its part to a campaign of financing in private, expecting to bring together 700.000 dollars to make the way towards the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, keeps projecting films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 of February, projecting the precious film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et you give dieux."
However, Christian Yaccarini has not been contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what it and its group of the falling proposals that they have received opine.
The veil of the Canada given a complex gets up...
The new American diplomatic cables spread by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States consider as the complex of the Canadians with regard to the Americans, but they reflect at the same time the feeling of superiority of these last ones towards Canada.
The American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electors do not think Canada-United States in the relations when they are going to vote and think that the visit of the president Obama has helped the preserving government to obtain that its budget was approved in 2009!
The four new communications among the American embassy of Ottawa and of Washington that has been done public yesterday, rather offer juicy details that contained really substantial.
A cable of the 22nd of September 2008, that is, during full federal election campaign, relates even which point the United States do not enter in the questions discussed by the political leaders.
This provoked great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders are seen conditioned on the Canadians by a practically inherent inferiority complex at the time of dealing the daily domestic questions, instead of leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988) ," writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador still has more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because both countries maintain some intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, it gives an opinion, the capacity of a candidate, of a match and, still more, of the head of a match to manage these essential relations it should be a key factor in which the electors should think at the time of voting."
Can be observed this feeling of importance also the cable, person in charge of businesses in Ottawa, sent on 22 of January 2009 for Terry Breese to prepare the president Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"Its journey will contribute towards guaranteeing the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will register for the first deficit time in the last decade due to a plan of recovery of between 30.000 and 40.000 million dollars," the gentleman writes Breese.
On no side is mention that the government had to defer the Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition replacing it nor that the opposition camps conditioned its survival to the quality of the plan of recovery suggested done.
Another communication in January 2008 signed by the alert ambassador Wilkins to Washington on the image more and more negative as they transmit the dramatic series spread in the CBC of United States.
The ambassador the broadcast of Border worries it, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references to Maher Arar are carried out, to the "Not-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for that the CIA carries out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable tells its French counterpart Bernard Kouchner that, during its first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked if Europe would be ready to receive some prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered that yes, but that it depended "on every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has delivered a document to the State Secretary in relation to Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to revising the dossier."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have warmed up in relation to the place WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser very near to Stephen Harper, declared in the radio of CBC that the one responsible for this massive escape should "be murdered."
In United States echo of Mike Huckabee is done.
A world plan to renew the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has suggested in Cancún a plan of renewal of the domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce the greenhouse gases (GEI) in a quantity that corresponds practically to a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is set in the specific ensemble of great projects which the UN expects to be adopted in Cancún to compensate the lack of binding appointments of reduction in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolize between the 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompactas light bulbs or, still better, for electroluminescentes light bulbs of diodes (OF THE or "LED" in English), many of the 1.800 million tons (Gt) of GEI emitted in the planet to illuminate the human beings would be prevented.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world broadcasts.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the broadcasts of the planetary automotive park.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the big issuing countries, as the United States, China, by Europe and others, included Canada, volunteers that had to decrease the global broadcasts were implicated with some plans of reduction of GEI of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this quantity should still be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increase of the temperatures in two centigrade degrees to prevent his being gotten out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of the fluocompactas light bulbs, the expense of energy comes down to 75% and with the new light bulbs LED, the energy consumption comes down still twice more.
The fluocompactas light bulbs last an average of between 6.000 and 10.000 hours.
The new light bulbs LED, as the ones that the manufacturer Philips has thrown this week (a company that, besides, has taken part in the study of the UN), have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less of energy than an incandescent light bulb, which allows us to do ourselves an idea about the saving that can be obtained with the plan of replacement that would apply itself to a hundred countries.
These new light bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very few heat.
Above, they do not contain anything of mercury.
Different specialists have expressed its reservations in relation to the fluocompactas light bulbs, since they contain mercury and that they must be eliminated as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except that the manufacturers place instructions.
However, it indicates the report, the main emission source of mercury in the planet they are not the fluocompactas light bulbs, but the thermal power stations of coal, which emit a great quantity of mercury to cause the electricity that is wasted with the incandescent light bulbs.
Only in United States, these headquarters emit 25.000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer for every country.
For example, Indonesia would save this way thousand millions of dollars to the year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent to 3,5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost to him 2.500 million.
Ivory Coast waits anxiously for the advertisement of the electoral results
The General Secretary of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential choices in Ivory Coast, since they have expired the fixed deadlines.
"The General Secretary highlights the need that the independent electoral commission completes its work and it announces the temporary results immediately," a spokesman of the head of the UN stands out.
"It asks to all the matches of Ivory Coast and to the institutions that prove its meaning of the responsibility and any initiative is abstained until the temporary results are announced."
In spite of the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left that it passes the deadline of Wednesday at midnight without being published the results, three days from the counting of Sunday.
About forty minutes before the ending of the deadline, the president of the CEI had told the television that the commission "kept working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the requests that the CEI proclaims finally the name of the winner of the second turn between the hump Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, the edict of Gbagbo has the annulment on the part of the constitutional Board of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the new Forces (FN) from the unsuccessful coup d'etat of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Ivory Coast, has stated that the maneuvers of intimidation of the electors carried out for the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded to the followers of the overhanging president of going to vote.
All the choice could remain nullified if the constitutional Board accepts the complaints presented by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a near political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north that denies any relation with the former rebels, has judged the delay of "unacceptable one" in the publication of the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but it has not gone far enough for him to claim the victory.
Its allies state that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that it has lost and that to present a complaint before the constitutional Board after having prevented that the electoral commission the broadcasting of the results, would be illegal.
The second one turned over from the presidential ones, on Sunday, had to have put the morello cherry to the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a country divided up into two since years ago.
The United Nations have warned on Wednesday the politicians of Ivory Coast that they could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first turn, the 31st of October, with 38% of the votes in front of 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly the support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first turn).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Organization of the Work (OIT), the unemployment rate in France has been maintained stable by 9,3% in continental territory (9,7% taking into account the departments of overseas), as they indicate the data corrected with the temporary seasonal variances (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains continental in 2.631.000 in France.
9,3% of the active population in continental territory and 9,7% with the DOM, has been confirmed by the data of the second quarter.
In a year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0,1 points.
In general, 3,4 million people in the metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, are or not available in the two weeks to work and search or I do not use.
The situation of the present youngsters in the job market has kept worsening, with a new increase of the unemployment rate up to the 24,2% in France continental (+0,9 points in three months, +0,5 points in a year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637.000 youngsters of between 15 and 24 years were unemployed in the sense of the OIT.
By its part, a slight increase of the stop among the people of advanced age has been registered, up to the 6,4% in France continental (+0,2 points in three months as well as in a year), that is, 482.000 people of more than 50 years, cipher that promotes to 6,6% with the DOM.
So alone has been registered a stability of the stop among the people of ages comprised between 25 and 49 years, with 8,3% in France continental (-0,1 points in three months, +0,1 points in a year) and 8,8% in all France.
The Insee leads from 2006 without publishing the rate of the monthly stop, after a controversy about its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the agency of statistics of the European Union, keeps making it and has announced on Tuesday a rate of 9,8% for France (included DOM) in October, after 9,9% in September.
Investigated and arrested Alexandre Guérini
Alexandre Guérini, of 53 years, manager of companies of treatment of wastes and brother of the president PS of the general Board of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, within the framework of a research on supposedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated by abuse of social goods, misappropriation of backgrounds and public goods, concealment, active corruption, peddling of political favors and possession of ammunition, as it indicates its lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will answer to all the questions that suggests it the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to intend it for a crowd of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," its lawyer, Florence Rault, had declared To the AFP before the appearance of its customer.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit a document to the judge through its lawyers, before its appearance, to explain himself.
On Wednesday they started to investigate at night and imprisoned likewise one of its near people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to its lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing that its customer has made has been to be in charge of the waste tips that he must manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or to the destination of the related backgrounds with its execution, it does not know at all about this, as the counselor says Simon.
Within the framework of this dossier, Daniel Pinna is being investigated likewise from Wednesday, ex chief operating officer of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of backgrounds and complicity, but have left it in probation and has prohibited to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My customer has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached it."
"The instructive magistrate has taken the explanations into account and it has left it in freedom," explained its lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The night of Tuesday to Wednesday they questioned another four people and left them the freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as it has indicated the attached prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, attached chief operating officer of the estate of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused by "peddling of political favors and passive corruption."
Two civil servants of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned by "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods for a person dedicated herself to the municipal service" and by "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds," respectively.
Finally, the colleague of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "concealment of the abuse of social goods."
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, imprisoned recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts that affected Córcega, appears.
The investigators suspect that its societies have service to whiten the asset of the big bandidismo.
The research is being carried out within the framework of several initiated judicial instructions against X in April 2009 after the reception of some anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the sector of the wastes.
A fountain near to the research indicates that the researches concentrate especially in the conditions of allocation and functioning of a waste tip in La Ciotat, who collects the residue of Aubagne, as well as of other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Matter Clotilde Reiss: the Eliseo has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the French investigative youngster stopped in Iran by "espionage," has had in suspense the public in France, has warned the diplomacy and has highlighted the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the attentive look of the diplomats of United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Eliseo has explained its strategy to the Americans up to the point of giving them boards to manage its own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
They show how the responsible Frenchmen tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youngster did not take place in exchange with the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and looked by the American justice for tráficos of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate to the media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had redeemed an essential function in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did not make anything.
A diplomatic telegram written out on the 12th of August 2009 in Paris takes the "Iran" bond: French comments on the mode of managing the cases of taking of hostages."
The adviser of the Eliseo for strategic matters, François Richier, d'Orsay accompanied of the director of the Quai for the north of Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend the Americans who make the following to repatriate its own citizens retained by force in Iran.
"Noise Haced," say, "release continuously" in the media the words "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
Everything to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask that you stop you, do it more frequently still."
Because, once the attempts at negotiation used up by discrete channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "expert in dilatory maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactics: the taking of hostages for the political blackmail."
It announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will be produced on the 16th of August, day in which he will take refuge in the embassy of France) will "require the fertilizer to the Iranians of a great quantity of money" (230.000 euros of reward).
Besides, it indicates that the Eliseo anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "goes to to increase."
The Iranians would be able "in a near future to arrest another of the nearly 1.800 French citizens that live" "in Iran," states.
The 28th of August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss goes out from prison after twelve days, but it remains blocked in Iran.
The following information is spread: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States request by illicit traffic of delicate electronic material towards Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as numerous observers, they doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, that near the Iranian clandestine nets of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release from prison of Majid Khakavand constitutes a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Releasing the Iranian in exchange for the Frenchwoman?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on the 4th of September, François Richier guarantees that it was not like this.
The Eliseo, states, not alone "has been surprised enormously for the decision of the judge," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the period, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can not nullify the decision" judicial, comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to prove that Majid Kakavand continues under the "close" surveillance of the French information services.
The adviser of the Eliseo marks a telephone number, he hangs and, afterwards, he informs the American diplomat about the Iranian "being at present in some buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Eliseo does not skimp in efforts, uses communiques and "escapes" organized in the media to do to believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad redeems an "important" paper and "influential" of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and prove that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several articles of press transmit the French official version.
A telegram dated the 25th of August 2009 mentions "the media blitz of the French civil servants."
To what such a "gratitude" towards Mr. Assad is owed, is asked the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of its declarations full of praises, the French civil servants recognize in private that so alone have a vague idea about what the Syrians have made really."
Next, the document deals with the reasons that they have taken to the Eliseo to make this fiction.
The great effort of communication "it aims to validate the policy of Sarkozy of opening towards Syria," gives an opinion.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the view of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been labeled of premature and been unworthy of it."
When exaggerating the Syrian paper," Paris tries "to show Syria the praises that it can harvest if it has a constructive paper in the region."
The goal also consists in "sowing the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it from reliable sources.
On the 11th of August, François Richier entrusts to him: "of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we have thanked it to him."
"At least, this should provoke confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss goes back to France on the 16th of May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Eliseo.
In a communique, he is grateful for their having had an "active paper in favor of the release of our compatriot" to the presidents of Brazil, to Senegal and to Syrian.
From midnight, the Korean youngsters can not play in line
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "of Cinderella" that will prevent the adolescents from taking part in games in line after the midnight blocking its access, as they have indicated responsible governmental.
In December a bill to the Parliament will be submitted to ask the companies of games in line to block the access to these games after midnight to the youngsters of less than 16 years, as they have indicated representatives of the Ministries of Culture and of Family.
"Many children play all the night and, afterwards, it is them difficult to study at school and to take a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect its health and its law to the dream," declared the AFP Jo Rin, responsible governmental person in charge of the bill.
The games in line will be again available at six in the morning.
The companies will have a year to be prepared for the application of the law, precise.
By the government asking the companies that limit for the daily access time to these games is suggested likewise when the fathers of the youngsters like this request it, added the responsible one.
Besides, he is going to put availably of the one who requests it free computer programs that allow limiting the time of connection to Internet.
South Korea is one of the more connected countries and the newspapers give news regularly on different facts linked to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is likewise the indisputable champion of the world competitions of games in line.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where it faced another 58 countries.
World championship 2018-2022: the FIFA designates the organising countries
In the middle of the storm provoked by the suspicions about corruption, the executive committee of the FIFA designates, a clearly political choice where the fights of influence and the lobbying can get to have priority over the technical criteria, Thursday to the organising countries of the Glasses of the world of 2018 and 2022.
A thing is clear, the edition of 2018 of the competition of the FIFA will be celebrated in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a debut in the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its introduction in the United States or in the Distant Orient (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, the prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) vouches for the economic and political interests that are in game in a World Championship.
The transactions among frames, therefore, it is possible that they last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of the FIFA, the candidacies English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that its competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much peso for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that drove to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Owners Adamu), could have ruined like this the opportunities of its country, cradle of the soccer, that only received the World Championship once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday when spreading a documentary that has put in evidence to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient the FIFA to dislike it and to embarrass the responsible Englishmen, who have thrown themselves to an intense lobbying in the last weeks with David Cameron in front.
The Head of Government expects to reedit the knock given with success by its predecessor, Tony Blair, which the organization of the JJ.OO. had obtained in 2005 for London 2012.
This intense activity, it will be sufficient to recover the brightness of England in front of the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duet has numerous strengths also thanks to its stadiums, any longer ready, its experience (World Championship of the 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Glass of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture.
However, the gloomy economic outlook and financing companies of both countries could undermine its ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the Englishmen and the doubts on the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing that obtain is to give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of peso in spite of the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the First Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to be displaced to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the poll," in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
They "are taking to glitter its dirty rags, trying to jeopardize them," stated Putin.
For 2022, the United States, that they have the experience of 1994, seem the most logical favourites.
First economic world power and headquarters of the main sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to take advantage to her to Japan and to South Korea, which have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship joint in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the World Championship 2026 to China, fervently wanted by the FIFA, which would provoke that Asia stayed without possibilities for 2022.
Beside Qatar, which has presented its project basing itself on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also be seen damaged by the weakness of the laws of TV paid (according to the hourly difference) by the European countries, the backbone of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the proof
Of Gaulle he had really doubted.
Mitterrand had given that it doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have even the smallest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
A mandate in the Eliseo it takes another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the proofs of that do not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it always has to be pretended that it is doubted.
Towards a side and towards the other one.
In 2006, even if they did not think it, the friends of Jacques Chirac stated that he did not discard a third mandate.
On the 15th of November, in serious pitch, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would take its decision "in some moment in fall of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the representatives of the UMP, on Tuesday at night in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked a certain commotion.
Is it about the official announcement of its candidacy?
By no means.
The president who was so alone indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of mandates of five years to two.
Simply it transmitted the facts, not an advertisement.
It is not the first time that it talks about the presidential ones, with a jocose pitch, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still pass seven years and half with me," had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "You do not think that I do not suggest myself what will come afterwards."
Its assertions of the day before yesterday do not bring him to the candidacy, nor either less more.
They spark off comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has raised what leads Nicolas Sarkozy to open the heart to the palestra.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that its candidacy in 2012 is evident is what takes the battle to many people of the PS to claim that it organizes itself before what is planned.
On the other hand, the bad surveys.
For the first time, the electors of right prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% in front of 44%, according to BVA-L 'BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is not any discussion on the subject," the environment of the First Minister has reacted in an immediate way and prudently.
"If it thinks that it can lose, it will not be candidate," opines Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always think that it can gain," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned itself in the face of the evidence.
Euro: the BCE is seen obliged to maintaining its acquisitions of Letters of the State
The last meeting of the Board of governors of the European Central Bank (BCE) of the year should allow needing the modalities of exit of the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a great number of not conventional operations of currency policy that they should finish at the end of year.
Because of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, being so urgent if he does not want to risk worsening a more situation than complicated today in the European markets of duties will undoubtedly not be able to be allowed by the institute of broadcast of Frankfurt.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French financial Minister, Christine Lagarde, has backed up the active paper had by the BCE in favor of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the European States.
It has not meant if he considered that the central bank should make more, increasing for example its program of purchase of state duties.
"I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues...."
The vespers, in Brussels, during its audience before the Commission of Economic and Monetary Matters of the European Parliament, the president of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent as for its intentions, indicating only that the program of purchase of Letters of the State in the secondary market "continued" and that "we" will already see "what we decide" during the meeting of Thursday.
The only thing that remains clear is that the BCE is going to maintain its main invariable type by 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of duties of the Treasure on the part of the BCE has doubled the week passed until it reaches nearly 1.350 million euros.
Besides, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, it would yesterday have bought again Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased bonds for an amount of 67.000 million euros since May 2010.
Among the operators of the market, the most minimum thing of which the purchases (consult the page 29) will continue is not doubted.
The economists do not foresee either no changes significant of direction.
Although the operations of loans at more than three months already have disappeared from the arsenal of the BCE, this still carries out unlimited allocations of liquidity to beneficial conditions and with durations that they vary between a week and three months.
The economists expect this device today to go on during some months.
"I do not imagine that it is going to modify considerably its program."
"If not, the risk to provoke would move new short-term tensions," opines Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more probable that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 is produced," anticipates for its side Norbert Bräms, economist in Salt.
Oppenheim.
In relation to the interventions in the market of the national debt, "the BCE should maintain a volume of purchase of these duties so that the market remains stable," it adds Norbert Bräms.
Taking into account the importance of the exhibitions of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the area of the euro, the institute of broadcast does not have more option its presence to maintain in the market.
"It must compensate to any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise of the yields paid by the most fragile States," an important manager of duties gave an opinion yesterday.
Because, if the types of interest set for the clouds, the States will still have more problems to reduce its indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi weathers the storm
That Italy has started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb of the types of the duties at 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
On the exit of a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation of "indecipherable" and that it was waited an "unpredictable" weekend, declarations denied later by the interested one.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term types they had reached the record cipher of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of coverage against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had gone off up to the 263 points, provoking a certain commotion in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was superior to 400 basic points.
But its right arm, Gianni Letta, appeared "deeply worried" about "the turbulences in the markets" and about a possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economics of the area of the euro, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is" Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson Institute, "as Portugal, explains.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the admissions associated to it, which provokes that the State moves the risk not to be able to face its needs for financing.
The last forecasts of Brussels have meant a pitcher of cold water for the government.
It is calculated that the Italian growth will reach 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012, whereas the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on some ciphers of 1,3% and 2%, respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4,3% of the PIB the year that comes (in front of the 3,9% foreseen by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Of there the rumor that new budgetary arrangements can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7.000 million euros.
"If necessary, new measures of austerity will have to be adopted," the Commissioner of Economic Matters, Olli Rehn, gives an opinion.
For the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The bases of its economics are in order and its accounts in good state, as we have been saying since some time ago," insures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator in the International Monetary Background responsible for Italy in the FMI.
"There is not any immediate problem, not even to short not even in the long term, because in spite of its considerable debt (119,2% of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts of stabilization requested from Italy are smaller than the required ones to other countries, it comments on Pier Carlo Padoan, head economist of the OCDE.
The problem of the political instability remains.
On the 14th of December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Camera of Representatives, after which the choices could anticipate at the end of March.
In such a case, it would open a period little favorable to the decision making in the event of a severe crisis.
The Europeans reflect on the reinforcement of the mechanisms of fight against the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think that we have already proved on Sunday, at night and for the day, that the Europeans are clearly supportive, decided, embarrassing with the defense of its coin and of its monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relaxation registered yesterday in the types of the duties to the European States has given impulse to the governments and the BCE.
However, we can not talk about a beginning of normalization yet.
The agency of qualification Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the qualification of the debt of Portugal, the white more frequent at present of the speculations.
"As in May, it misses really political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP opine Paribas.
Especially because "the political rhythm is much slower than the rhythm of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers that hides, the European countries intensify the debates to reinforce the mechanisms of exit of the crisis already existing.
The informal consultations among the Ministers of Finances who see themselves more directly affected and, in general, with its counterparts of the G-20 go through good path.
And this taking also the meetings of the Eurogroup and of the Ecofin into account at the beginning of the week that comes.
The BCE meets today.
In the agenda, the type of not conventional measures of support to the countries of the area of the euro in the collimator of markets (it consults more above).
As for the European Background of Financial Stability (FEEF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has initiated on Tuesday in Singapore a tour through Asia to inform the investors of the Distant Orient about the novelties of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits does not consist in raising backgrounds, it undoubtedly prepares the ground.
It is foreseen that the first broadcasts of bonds of the FEEF are carried out next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative has entrusted the agency Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase of the backgrounds mobilized through an additional direct appointment of the FMI.
As for the countries that are found in first line, Portugal and Spain, these itself prepare to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the job market.
These reforms are added to the measures of austerity with a nearer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to advance through a different path that Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to prevent at any price to request international aid before before of applying its own budgetary corrections and of deciding the structural reforms that they consider essential to increase the confidence in a long-lasting way.
Finally, the available options are suggested by the capitalist partners of the European backgrounds to speed the normalization process of the markets of public duties up.
On the way for Paris, on 24 of November, Axel Weber was the first in launching the idea that, if the 750.000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Background were not sufficient, the Union would not doubt to take the wallet again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of first line in the market of the European national debt, consider that an amount of about 100.000 million additional euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for that: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, endowed at present with 60.000 million euros.
A board that, undoubtedly, the European capitals could examine in a detailed way.
Especially if they worsen the conditions of market.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
The snowstorms keep provoking difficulties of circulation, especially in the secondary net in Brittany, and can affect different economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snowstorms and of formation of ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, by Deux-Sèvres and Vienne Dordogne have been added to the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at the half a day and two, and Gironde, were joined to the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy fallen snowstorms affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in Isla de Francia.
Some layers of snow of between 2 and 5 cm are waited, punctually of between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and of between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Normandy regions of Decrease, Isla de Francia and Lemosín.
The snowstorms are heavy enough as to provoke difficulties of circulation and to affect some economic activities, it warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, the access to several departmental roads to the heavy vehicles of more than 7,5 tons has been forbidden, once the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac have been included.
According to the policemen, the circulation in the secondary net of Brittany is complicated, by what they recommend that does not drive except if need be and has been forbidden the circulation of specific vehicles TER during the day.
During Thursday, the school transport has been forbidden in Craftiness.
Any specific measure had not been foreseen on Wednesday at night to limit the circulation of the heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "tells to all the drivers to their driving with the biggest prudence in the roads and to their adapting its conduction to the situation."
The Headquarters of the civil aviation (DGAC) asked the air companies to nullify on Thursday 25% of its flights in the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because of the planned snowstorms.
The DGAC recommends the air passengers to be contacted its airline.
In Big Brittany, the airport of Gatwick, in the south of London, and that of Edinburgh, in Scotland, they are closed until Thursday in the morning.
Meter of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport in the Isla de Francia has reached its decisive point, thousands of millions are rained.
At least, in the debate.
Particularly, we talk about the 23.000 million for the meter of the Grand Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of backgrounds of 4.000 million euros.
In the theoretical plan, this addition will be the one that will allow later the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, we at last have the first accounts.
The rectifying financial law of 2010, examined in the financial commission of the National Assembly this morning, contains the planned devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase of the tax on the offices in the Isla de Francia.
The first, as we read in the article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
Besides, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is of 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that there is already "to modernize it, to increase its product and to station this increase in the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would it be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
In the text ciphers do not occur.
But it is far from 4.000 million.
"It "is needed the fiscal resources to be added at the 4.000 million euros of the allocation of backgrounds that the State will mobilize and that Grand Paris will be granted to the Société du as it advances the project," we can read in the exposition of reasons.
This system does not surprise the SGP for him.
"From the moment in which admissions (the two taxes, ndlr) are created, we can cover the studies for three years and afterwards to receive the 4.000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be registered in the budget and it will be used according to the needs."
The SGP calculates that empecerá to receive the 4.000 million in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This device, in which the 4.000 million promised do not appear in the loan, can provoke a slightly crazy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on the 7th of December.
Vengeful hackers and diligent spies
The matter WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a visible scandal, a scandal that so alone seems scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that rules the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at an international scale and foresees a future dominated by the regression.
But we go crossing to crossing.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every dossier created by a secret service (independently of the nation that it belongs to) is formed exclusively by press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi so alone reflect what has been written since months in any newspaper (except those that belong to Berlusconi) and the profile ago sinisterly ridiculizador of Khadafi has been giving a lot of time ideas to the artists of cabaret to create its sketches.
The norm according to which the secret dossiers so alone must be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not alone in this century.
If it visits a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, it will see that every work repeats (on Grail, the mystery of Rennes-him-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not owed only to the authors of occultist texts not wanting to do new researches (or do not know how where to look for novelties on what is non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occultism that is not so alone trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret dossiers.
The informer is lazy, the same as the head of the secret services is lazy (or has little longing) (whether it could not be, I what I know, editor of the Libération), that only it considers true what can recognize.
The secret top information on Berlusconi that sent the American embassy of Rome to the Department of State was the same one that published the Newsweek the previous week.
Then, why have the revelations of these dossiers caused such a commotion?
On the one hand, so alone say the that every person cultivated already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least from the Second World War and since the Heads of States can be called by telephone or catch the airplane to be brought together to dine, they have lost its diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercises of representation, have transformed into centers of espionage.
Any spectator that sees films of research knows it perfectly, so alone we show off that we do not know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact that it repeats it publicly infringes the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of the American diplomacy.
In the second place, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world affects the prestige of the Department of State considerably.
Therefore, the scandal affects the casualties as well as the "hangmen."
But let's enter the real nature of what he has passed.
Formerly, in the period of Orwell, it could be conceived to every power as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of its subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has come true since, every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction carried out, visited hotel, being able to control taken highway, the citizen became a complete casualty of the eye of the power this way.
But when it is proved, as it happens now, that not even at least the crypts of the secrets of the power can not escape to the control of a hacker, the relation of control stops being one-way and turns circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the vengeful one of the citizens) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power be held that can not even keep its own secrets any longer?
It is true, as he already said Georg Simmel, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret never will be able to be revealed); it is also true that every knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public area; but to reveal, as it has done WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away every power from it.
WikiLeaks has not done it any damage To Sarkozy or To Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and to Obama.
Which will be the consequences of this wound caused at such a powerful power?
It works out evident that, in the future, the States will not be able to put any tips any longer in the net, since it would be as publishing it in a poster in full street.
But also evident result that, with the current technologies, it can not be expected to maintain confidential conversations by telephone.
Nothing easier result to discover if and when a Head of State has been displaced by airplane and one of the counterparts has been contacted.
How will they be able to keep in the future private and confidential relations?
I know perfectly that, for the moment, my forecast is a thing of science fiction and, therefore, novelesque, but I imagine to governmental agents that they move discretely in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, taking messages that they have learned by heart or, at the most, hiding some data written in the heels of its shoes.
That information is preserved then, in only one copy, in locked drawers: after all, the attempt at espionage of the Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that the technology at present advances as a crab backward, that is.
A century after the telegraph without cables has revolutionized the communications, Internet has created a telegraph with cables (telephone) again.
The videotapes (analogical) had allowed to the investigators of the cinema to study a crossing film to crossing, advancing and moving back, discovering all the secrets of the assembling, whereas now the CD (digital) only they allow to advance or to move back of chapter in chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go of Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by airplane, with the displacements that it entails, we need three hours and average.
Therefore, it is not at all out of the normal one that the policy and the techniques of communication take again to us to the carriages.
A last comment.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what was plotted in secret in the embassies.
At present, those that ask for confidential information to the press are the embassies.
Climate: the botches of France in its promises of financing
A year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is an hour of examining if the promises of financing quickly unblocked (fast start called or precocious) carried out by the developed countries have been respected.
And the French botches have been revealed.
In the Agreement of Copenhagen, the developed countries committed themselves to providing 30.000 million dollars among 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to providing 7.200 million euros in three years and France 1.260 millions of euros (that is, 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best cards on the table to convince its members that its appointment with the financings fast start is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The noticeable result transparency operation and was noticed for what really it is valid: the developing countries and the civil society would want for all the developed countries to make what was same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that she has released 2010 2.200 million euros, which situates it in the good path towards the fulfillment of its appointment of 7.200 million in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in a detailed way, the things are more complicated.
According to the Agreement of Copenhagen, the money must be "new and additional" to guarantee that a complementary effort is carried out, without damaging the official help to the development.
Unfortunately, people have not arrived to an agreement on what it means "new and additional."
When the European Commission suggested a harmonization, some Member States, included France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, every cual chooses the reference that it needs more.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 for reference: the international financing keeps and 150 million are added in three years in concept of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references as for the year or at the level of the official help to the development.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all the new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, the expenses of the years previous even to the total level of the official help to the development are referred to.
Specifically, the total amount of the help of France to the developing countries can remain stable (or even to decrease), while it pretends that it respects its appointment on the subject of "new and additional" backgrounds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once more, there is not any norm and every cual chooses the method of calculation.
Some, as France, consider that every borrowed euro is equivalent at a donated euro.
Evidently, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for specific inversions that are profitable (frequently, related projects with the reduction of broadcasts that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is going to recover as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At the most, only the cost of the loan should be computed for its appointments for the country that grants the loan (that is, the equivalent to an interest rate).
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: he "respects" its appointment of 420 million euros doing 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8,5% of donations (36,1 million euros); consult the document of the EU to see it for its own eyes.
It is about the only country of the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, whereas Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect its appointments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to comply its appointment, France so alone contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its financing fast start, France carries out a double abuse: for a part, in relation to the actions in the time and, for another, in relation to the real financial effort.
Using up so alone 36,1 million euros, manages to give the impression that it uses up 420 million "new and additional," as it had been promising.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finances (because it seems that it is Bercy the one who has been occupied of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, so much in the EU (why were going to keep donating the other Member States when they can simply lend?) as in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter of the precocious financing is a trifle, relatively short-term, in relation to the ensemble of the negotiations on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand of more in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
Let's expect it not to be like this.
It is what went, it is essential to learn of this first year of precocious financings.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its appointments and in the same way as the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could make the debates advance on the bets in game in relation to the long-term financing (another essential chapter that is being discussed at present): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or of the method to compute the loans.
France could change its posture to turn as progressive in relation to this question as it is with others.
Therefore, we have the expectation of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, which will reach Cancún next week.
A surprise advertisement on the fast start of France and on its vision of the "additional character" and of the use of the loans would contribute towards improving the necessary international confidence level to advance in the negotiations.
Warning on the pesticides ingested by the children
A child of 10 years ingests on a day 81 different chemical substances, as it indicates a study published on Wednesday for the association Générations Futures (the old movement for the laws and the respect of the future generations).
The association, that it warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of exhibitions analyzed, but they are illustrative of the dealt issue," acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years usually consumes in four foods and a snack at the day.
These foods taken as model, who the official recommendations (five parts of fruits and fresh vegetables, three of dairy products and 1,5 liters of water at the day) respect, as well as the candies, were examined in the laboratories in search of, pesticidal chemical substances, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic insurances, as well as 37 substances susceptible of acting as endocrine disturbers (PE), according to the studies of different institutions as the international Center of research on the cancer.
"Although, practically in the whole of the cases, the statutory ceilings are not surpassed for each of the chemical substances in an individual way, our study shows clearly that the exhibition of the consumers to pollutants possibly carcinogenic and/or worrisome result PE," indicates the association.
For the breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk they contain by themselves more than one tens of possible carcinogenic wastes and three ones considered as carcinogenic insurances, as well as nearly one twenty of wastes that can damage the hormonal system alone.
The apple, imported from Brazil, foreseen as snack for the school, contains traces of six chemical substances, a prohibited fungicide included in France.
The same applies to the green beans of Kenya, included in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful prohibited insecticide in the EU.
Besides, the hamburger steak, the tuna in can and even the loaf or the gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the faucet, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the slice of salmon was the most "nutritional" with 34 detected chemical wastes and even the analysis of the dish of plastic used to warm up the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "cocktails of pollutants" generate for the consumer "it is probably underestimated," says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its part, has suggested "in the face of the gravity of the situation" applying a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase of the illnesses associated to the civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency of Food Safety (AESA) indicated the presence of wastes of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and the vegetable consumed in Europe, of which 76 in the cereals.
