The matter NSA underlines the total absence of debates on the piece of information
How the contradictory attitude to explain of the French government, that of a quotation offends itself in public while summoning the ambassador of the United States October 21, and other forbids the flying over of the territory by the bolivian presidential airplane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence to his edge of Edward Snowden?
According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Holland telephones Barack Obama or when the minister of the foreign affairs Laurent Fabius summons the ambassador of the United States, they react to a true discovery, that is the one of the extent of the American supervision on the body of the communications in France.
Not is it surprising to read in the columns of the World to some weeks of interval on one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listen Quay of Orsay by the NSA?
Not there would be as a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic gait is not a moral positionnement, but the research of the interest and relevance of information that allow every citizen to forge itself an opinion.
When raised WikiLeaks the sail on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political or other issues the entire world, we consider in fact that, to the look of the American power, that constitutes an important lighting.
When we describe the American systems of interception in opposition to the French diplomacy to the United States, this is not in any case to outrage us of this practice, is to describe the world such as it is.
Did France benefit from information furnished by the concerning NSA of the terrorist operations aiming our interests?
Can one to deprive oneself American collaboration?
Set it up since wholesale ten years of technological tools of interception very powerful by the United States, but also by France, officially was justified by the fight against the terrorism.
Besides, in this domain, France and the United States notably set up of the procedures of cooperation and of exchanges of almost daily information and that are described party and of other as essential.
By way of example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal zones to Miranshah was signaled to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit entire pads of given ones on the region of the Sahel to the American services, and, in compensation - one the already quickly said -, the Americans can give the news to the French on of other regions of the world.
Therefore the bottom question behind this matter NSA is not so the capacity or the right of the countries to endow itself with interception tools, that the question of the total absence of debates previous, notably within the Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be it them, and, in the last analysis, the question of the attained to liberties.
What do risk actually the United States? a degradation of their picture?
One has beautiful to denounce them, I do not see any which manner they will be able to be punished.
The risk run by the Americans can be doubles.
The first one, it is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes to the highest summit of their State, were overseen.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States stretched themselves.
Another effect can be him more economical: more and more of European or South American businesses grumble, to the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American contractors subjected to the American laws, and therefore to the mastery of the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of engaged revelations by media of the entire world, that contributes to set in motion a debate on the practices of supervision of the services of piece of information even then practically nonexistent, could push the legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the strengths that they gave to their piece of information services.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqui Prime Minister, in the middle of the flare-up of violence
The American president had to receive 1st Friday November 2013 the Iraqui Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, in quest of assistance of the United States to fight against the strongest wave of violence for five years.

Men are cut down in the middle of the street or same at their place, and the security forces are equally the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the minority sunnite, in power under Saddam Hussein, that complains about to be marginalized politically and to be the target of unfair arrests, favored this violence flare-up.
Friday, of new violence killed four people in the north of the Iraq, to the day following the at least death 26 people in an attempt series, of which the trapped explosion of five cars to the north of Baghdad.
A good party of the violence was ascribed to the Islamic State in Iraq and to the Lifting (EIIL), an affiliated group to Al qaida (extremist sunnites), equally implied in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "World War" against Al qaida.
The violence are at the center of the discussions to the United States of the Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki that will be received Friday by the president Barack Obama, two years after their preceding encounter, December 12 2011.
To the era, the American president, elected on the promise to put an end to the military engagement in this country, had erected a picture optimist of the position.
Since his arrival Wednesday to Washington, Nouri Al Maliki multiplied the meet with the executive, and the elected officials of the Congress.
Thursday, it pled for that the international community takes a "third World War" against Al qaida.
The increased principle of an assistance to the Iraq in security matters is supported by of influential republican senators and democrats.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him the partial responsibility of the return of the violence by his "sectarian political and authoritarian".
They also demanded Barack Obama as it does to understand to Nouri Al Maliki as "influence pernicieuse of the Iran within the Iraqui government constitutes a serious problem in our bilateral relation".

The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure to smoke
Scientists developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure that one takes to smoke a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect to life of the mice of the dependance to the nicotine.
Of other tests are necessary before beginning the essays on the human being, but the Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York declared that the first signs were encouraging.
"We hope really that this kind of vaccinal strategy will be able to help millions of smokers that tried to stop, exhausting all the today available methods on the market, but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to overcome these different approaches", declared the Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that was modified to transport necessary genetic the news to conceive anti-nicotine antibodies.
The vile virus in a selective way the cells of the liver, that begins then to produce an uniform flow of antibody.
The antibodies stalk all the molecules of nicotine present in the sanguine system and the neutralize before they attain the brain, which prevents the smoker to have his dose of nicotine.
At the time of the tests, the vaccinated mice to that one gave next nicotine followed their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were appeased", declared the researchers, signs that the nicotine had attained their brain.
The experiences are described in the magazine Science Translational Medicine.
The preceding vaccines against tobacco proved themselves inefficient for they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated if frequently for that the antibody levels remain students that they were too costly and little practice.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be well inferior for it transforms the cells of the liver some machine to antibody.
The Professor Crystal declared that if the future vaccine to human usage was completely sure, one could manage it to the children before they are attempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to the nicotine.
But it is more probable than it is used by the smokers that want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they recommence to smoke, they will not take any pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will be able to help them to lose their bad habit", it added.
British scientists declared that the results were interesting but signaled that of the research well more deepened were necessary.

Google, Samsung and Huawei are the object of judicial pursuits concerning the patents Nortel
The group that possesses thousands of former patents Nortel started an avalanche of judicial pursuits regarding patents Thursdays in opposition to manufacturers of portable telephones, notably Google, the corporation that it groomed to the post at the time of the sale to the bids of the patents that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that obtained the patents Nortel for 4.5 Md$, filed a complaint in opposition to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other corporations for patent violation in front of the crown Court of the United States to the Texas.
Rockstar is held jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused to have violated seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow posting an advertising related to terms of research on Internet, indicated the conclusions of the process, which is the heart of trade of Google.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make telephones that work under the operating system Android of Google, that book a ferocious competition to the movable products Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an offer initial of 900 M$ for the patents of Nortel.
Google increased his offer to several returns, for finally to propose 4.4 Md$.
After losing the patents Nortel facing Rockstar, Google obtained afterward Motorola Mobility for an amount of 12.5 Md$, a market in left based on the library of patents of Motorola.
"Although having failed in his attempt to obtain the patents in cause during the bids, Google violated and continues to violate lesdits patents", indicated the conclusions of the process.

Born Tripodi to be influenced by Obeid
The Labor former minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi will be the object of an investigation of the regulating anti-corruption one State.
The former minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi denied to have modified politics of leases commercial to the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, that had hidden interests in three situated goods in the zone controlled by the government.
Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) widened his investigation for knowledge if Mr. Obeid had done pressure on several ministers of the State to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid possess two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without that it did not have call of offers.
She investigates henceforth on the allegations according to which ones Mr. Tripodi was during the course of the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these property, after the testimony of the assistant general former secretary of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of started discussions in 2005, the government did pressure for that the leases be the object of an offer call.
The tenants were against and wanted equally longer lengths.
In 2009, the leases concerning the businesses of Circular Quay, that retrieved to the Obeid about 2.5 M$ per year, were renewed without that it does not have call of offers.
Mr. Tripodi, that was minister of the Harbors of February 2006 to November 2009, was at the start in favor of the offer calls.
But it denied to have changed his political one to the request of Mr. Obeid that, recognized Mr. Tripodi, claimed a change of the political governmental one regarding leases.
The telephone conversation rescript presented to the ICAC showed past calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a top ranking official that had arrived to the ministry of the Harbors after working under the orders of M Obeid to the ministry of the Fishings.
"The debated subject during these telephone conversations was the elaboration of the political one relating to the commercial leases?", asked the assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"Not", replied Mr. Tripodi.
I do not remind me any what discussed us but in any case, this was not any that.

FAA: The aerial passengers henceforth can use gadgets on board of the airplanes (but not to pass a call with their portable telephone)
The passengers of the airline companies will be able to use their electronic devices of door to door selling to read, to work, to play at games, to look at films and to listen music – but not to speak on their portable telephone – by virtue of the new directives very awaited published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But the passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The rapidity with which the change will be set up will vary of an airline company to the other, declared the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta at the time of a press conference.
The airline companies will have to prove to the FAA that their airplanes respect the new directives and that they updated the manuals of formation of the members of crew and the rules concerning the tidying up of the devices to be in accordance.
The FAA declared that she already had received plans of certain aiming airline companies to widen the usage of the electronic devices on their airplanes.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies that already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve a widened usage of the electronic devices very soon", indicated the FAA in a declaration.
Currently, the passengers must extinguish their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the airplane are closed.
They are not supposed to rekindle them before the airplane attains an altitude of 10 000 feet and that the order gives his green light.
The passengers are supposed to extinguish their devices at the time of the descent of the airplane before landing and not to rekindle them until the airplane put itself.
By virtue of the new directives, the airline companies of which correctly had them are protected from electronic interferences will be able to authorize the passengers to use their devices during the take-offs, landings and the rumble to the ground, declared the FAA.
Most of the new airplanes of line and others had that were modified so that the passengers can use the wi-fi to higher altitudes, should satisfy the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Awaiting, said itself happy of these changes.
"Once the political new one implement in any security – and we will work in narrow collaboration with the carriers for that – it will be profitable to everyone", explained Glading in a declaration.
We frankly tired to feel as of the "overseeing of room" when it is a matter of this question.
But it always will be forbidden to connect itself to Internet to surf, to exchange emails and SMS or to download data underneath 10 000 feet, declared the agency.
The passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in method airplane.
Therefore not yet of Words With Friends, the online game trains Scrabble to which one played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when it was expelled to big noise of an airplane of American Airlines after refusing extinguishing his device while the device was parked to the door.
And the heavier devices as the laptops always will have to be arranged for they could injure someone if they flew through the telephone booth.
The portable telephones on board will continue to be equally forbidden.
The statutory strength concerning the portable telephones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA can get up the ban on certain electronic devices during the take-off and landing
The last months, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national expert in security of the transportations on CBS New, declared that the portable telephones always were considered as presenting a risk.
"The portable telephones truly are a problem, not only because they eventually could create interferences with the navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could perturb the antennas relay of mobile communication if they are used on board", declared Rosenker.
An industrial consultative committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended the last months that the government authorizes a wider usage of the personal electronic devices.
The weighing pressure on the FAA reinforced itself during the last years to soften the restrictions concerning their usage.
Detractors such as the Clear senator McCaskill, d-mo., support that it does not exist any reason of valid security for these bans.
The restrictions are equally more and more difficult to apply for the usage of the devices became omnipresent.
Certain studies indicate that at least a third of the passengers forget to extinguish their devices, or do it deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the usage of the electronic devices in 1996 after the reports on the interference presence with the instruments of navigation and of communication when the passengers transported radios FM, the gadget high-tech of then.
The new airplanes of line depend a lot more of the electric systems than the preceding generations of airplanes, but they are equally conceived to withstand electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
The airline companies allow their passengers to use the wi-fi to the cruise altitudes for a number of years.
Had modified them to welcome systems wi-fi withstand equally better to interferences.
The vast majority of the airplanes of line should allow a wider usage of the electronic devices by virtue of the new directives, declared Huerta.
The electronic devices of today emit usually transmissions radio of power well weaker than the preceding generations of devices.
The readers of electronic books, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when one turns a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those that do pressure for a softening of the restrictions concerning the usage of the devices electronic by the passengers.
In 2011, the leaders of the corporation loaded an airplane of line of readers of electronic books Kindle and did it to fly to see if there were problems, but it not in had anything.
That inspired to the members of the consultative committee of the FAA of the ambivalent feelings as for the knowledge question if the usage of the devices presents or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers declared that it thought that interferences originating devices were real, even if the risk was slight.
Of other members of the committee declared that it exists only anecdotic reports emanating pilots that indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of an airplane, and that most of between them are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA authorizes the pilots to ask the passengers to extinguish their devices during the landings to the instruments in conditions of weak visibility.
A group of the industry of the trip congratulated itself for the changes, the calling arrangements a lot of common sense for equipped travelers of technologies.
"We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant fleeting experience is not incompatible with the security", declared Roger Dow, President and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
The rules relating to the usage of electronic devices on board remain for the moment in force in Australia
The Australian aerial passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and their smartphones during the take-off and the landing despite the gesture of the United States aiming to soften the regulation relating to the electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration American left the open door to the American carriers for a change of their procedures so that the passengers can read electronic books, look at videos or play at games on their devices during the flight phases criticize provided that they are in method "airplane".
The passengers already can do it during the biggest party of the flight, but many people find painful of not to be able to attain their electronic books during the take-off and landing.
The Australian carriers examine the decision that obliges the American carriers to carry out an important work regarding to respect the requirements, but indicated that they do not have the intention for the time being to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority equally declared that she examined the announcement but underlined that the restrictions concerning the usage of the electronic devices during the phases of critical flight always were in force in Australia.
"PUT it does not dispose any specific regulations governing the usage of the electronic devices in airplane", she declared.
The question is the object of a regulation that obliges the exploiting aircraft to guarantee the maintenance of the security in permanence and the passengers to respect record them security given by the crew members.
Virgin, that already spoke with PUT it of his intention to spread the usage of his system of recreation on board using the technology wi-fi, was opened to a change, but declared that she would follow the regulating one.
"We favorably would welcome a revision of PUT it that would allow the usage of the electronic devices for we think really that that would improve the experience customer now that we dispose (system of recreation on board using the technology wi-fi) on our airplanes", indicated a spokesperson.
Qantas declared that she respected for the moment the current rules.
"In accordance with our political current one, the electronic devices cannot be used during the take-off and landing, and we do not have the intention for the time being to change that", she declared.
The decision of the FAA applies to the American airline companies.
Nevertheless, we always interested by the statutory evolutions that could profit to the passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons of this one.
For the American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary of an airline company to the other and will depend on the age of floats them.
The carriers will have to show that their airplanes can tolerate interferences radio originating of electronic devices, just like to review the manuals, formation equipment, the program of transportation of hand luggage and record them furnished to the passengers.
"As soon as an airline company verified the tolerance of his floats, she can authorize the passengers to use electronic light portable devices, as tablets, readers of electronic books and smartphones to all the altitudes", declared the FAA.
In the rare cases of weak visibility, the required crew to the passengers to extinguish their devices during landing.
The group equally recommended that the heavier devices are arranged in any security under the seats or in the superior compartments during the take-off and landing.
The CDC publishes counsels on the allergies with the child bound for the schools
Wednesday, the American Center of checks and of prevention of the diseases published a directive series indicating how to manage food allergies of the children to the school.
It is a matter of the first series of guiding lines that the American government publishes, since the number of children in suffering school age of food allergies strongly climbed.
A child on 20 to the United States suffers today of a food allergy.
The CDC discovered that the prévalence of food allergies with the child had increased of 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains the news intend for the schools on the manner to sensitize the professorial body and the personnel to food allergies with the child, and on the manner to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It recommends equally to the schools to have a stock of épinéphrine – the car injector of brand EpiPen the most often being used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially mortal anaphylaxie.
The legislative assemblies of the States recently updated the regulations to allow the schools to have more easily épinéphrine in stock.
The report understands equally a list of the typical symptoms communicated by the children that have an allergic reaction.
The children can say, "I HAVE the impression that something pricks me the language", "I HAVE the impression to have a hair on the language" or "I HAVE picotements on the language".
A lot of oppositions to the medical assistance to die to the Congress of the palliative cares
The Canadian Congress of palliative cares, that unfolds itself this week to Ottawa, arises some days after the vote in favor of the principle of the project of law on the medical assistance to die to the Quebec.
This is the occasion for several associations of palliative cares to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective cares to appease their sufferings, what's more to be able to remain at the house, very little of them would want to put an end to their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Association of the palliative cares, Maryse Bouvette.
If one put the accent on the palliative cares to Canada, the approach euthanasia would become slight.
The president of the Network of the palliative cares of the Quebec rejects also the project of law on the medical assistance to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences on the next generations.
"Which is the direction of life", she deplores.
The majority of the houses of palliative cares will refuse to help the patients to die, according to the vice president of the Alliance of the houses of palliative cares, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, also director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie to Gatineau, considers that the service would be in any case useless.
One never asks us: "I want to die, give me an injection".
The director of the Association of the palliative cares of the Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the project of law of the Quebec bewilders the population on the subject of the vocation of the palliative cares.
It does not believe that the Ontario keep in step.
Of his side, delegated it liberal Gatineau, Stéphanie Valley, asserts that the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the law project is adopted.
Halloween 2013: Some amount
When I was small, Halloween was magic.
My sister and me were authorized to eat candies, to be going to put to bed us late and to disguise us to go in the neighborhood.
Today, I became stingier.
These two last years, I did not distribute a single candy and I will do it certainly not more this year.
But the stats show that I am the mangy ewe when one talks about Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 Md$ in candies, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I await with impatience to every party of Halloween are the tendencies.
The disguises should represent 1.2 Md$ on the 6.9 spent billions, according to the NRF.
This year, the objects sexy unconscious do fury.
The women no longer have need to be professional sexy; they can equally be foods sexy as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
With regards to the men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the televised series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the space of Punk Daft will figure among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the disguises the done more look for are the zombies, Batman, the pirates and the witches.
I suppose that there is not of poorly to remain traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my big astonishment, they were not the only ones.

The Americans will spend 1.9 Md$ in candies this year, according to the office Nielsen.
That represents about 272 millions of kg of bars Hershey, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and block Clark.
It is a great new one for the 41 millions of children who go hunting to the candies in their neighborhood, according to the American department of the Commerce.

The candies corn are the only thing that one does not want to eat; and nevertheless almost 16 millions of kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.

According to this wishing witness to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" to Jomba before climbing to the forehead for a "raking operation".
One heard very clearly behind him of cracklings nourish light weapons.
Of Bunagana, political fief and last strong place of fallen rebellion Wednesday, a journalist of the AFP could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source to the Mission of the united Nations for the stabilization of the RDC, the fight entered "in a final phase", the FARDC having "encircled the positions of the M23 residual to evict them".
Since the return, Friday, clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco participates not directly to the fight, but she furnishes to the governmental troops a determining support regarding piece of information, of observation and of planning.
In afternoon end, several tens of soldiers, well supplied in munitions, climbed heading for the front line.
They were armed kalachnikov and of lance roquettes.
A little earlier, on the taking road to Bunagana, posts border with the Uganda, helped military officers of civil ones loaded a lance roquettes multiple climbed on a truck brand nine of the FARDC, having to assure the relief of another vehicle pounding the positions of the M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called Wednesday evening a new time the rebels to "to demobilize itself voluntarily" under penalty of to be disarmed "by the force", but left open the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and the M23 discuss since December without result for the moment.
On the spot, the leaders politics of the M23 hope to succeed in an agreement.
"We finished the talks, it no longer remains than to the mediation ougandaise to organize the signature", asserted Roger Lumbala, vice president of the delegation of the M23, without this information can being confirmed immediately governmental side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, essentially tutsi, integrated in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa uniformly accuse the Uganda and the Rwanda to support the M23, which refute Kigali and Kampala.
The North kivu is the one of the regions the more populated densément of the RDC, and his basement is crammed mining coveted resources.
To Bunagana, side ougandais of the border, where had taken refuge themselves about 5000 people between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the return movement towards the RDC that had set in motion to in the morning inverted itself to the midday.

The worry linked to the security to the Mozambique grows at the same time that of the conflicts burst enters powerful personalities
To the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, founding president of the Mozambique, in the process of regarding them, thousands of people mustered themselves in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans at the time of a rare public demonstration.
"We want that peace returns; we want stability", declared Vanessa of Sousa, general director of a corporation of investment.
Worried for the future of his country, she exchanged its work clothing against a you shirt carrying the mention "we want the security" in Portuguese before rejoining the stored up crowd on the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there were practically everyday reports mentioning conflicts between the governmental forces and the Renamo, the worse clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was formerly a movement rebels famous, supported at the start by the governed Rhodésie by white then the government of apartheid of South Africa in the framework of the efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After an agreement of signed peace in 1992, she became an opposition party.
The analysts think that the country should not fall again in a conflict open, but the recent events shook the foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the rapidly expanding economy since the discovery of huge reserves of gas offshore and of deposits of coal in the northwest could attract more than 50 Md$ of investments during the next years originating corporations as Rio Tinto, Is worth Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the in power party and the principal political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject themselves mutually the responsibility of tensions.
The Renamo declares that the government is at the origin of the recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when the governmental forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempt to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government returns the responsible Renamo to have released the conflicts, and the accused to attack soldiers.
The president Armando Guebuza tried minimize the worries concerning the instability.
Mr. Guebuza declared Wednesday to the AFP, the agency of French press, that Mr. Dhlakama considered itself as a "losing" that wanted to use "all the forces that it remained him to attempt to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government".
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist to say that they wish both of them to avoid the war.
But the worry grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that the Renamo abandoned the agreement of peace of 1992.
It declared to the FT that it wanted to say that the agreement was not respected anymore by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume the negotiations, but with most serious biggest", indicated Mr. Mazanga.
The preceding discussions between the parties did not succeed appeasing tensions supplied by a conflict series this year.
"It is two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that do not stop disputing itself", explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer of the open university and specialist of the Mozambique.
None of them knows well to negotiate and anything of them is ready to do the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, that is in favor of electoral reformations, already had said that she would boycott the municipal elections in front of to take place in November.
The presidential elections and legislatures are foreseen next year.
Certain commentators interpreted his usage of the force as the sick attempt of a movement to obtain from the concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The party of the votes collected by the Renamo does not stop lowering since 1992, while a new party, the democratic Movement of the Mozambique (MDM) that was created by a former member of the Renamo, should obtain a bigger number of votes to the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – that should withdraw itself at the end of his second mandate next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country.
"It does not want any a democracy multipartite, it does not want any transparent elections, it does not want peace for it does not want to leave the presidency", declared Mr. Mazanga.
One knows not exactly which is the capacity of the Renamo, but she took attacks flashes disruptive on the commissionerships of police and the vehicles on an axis autoroutier north south major.
Most of clashes took place in the province of Sofala, that is situated to several hundreds of kilometers to the north of Maputo, but where is located Beira, the harbor from which the mining corporations, notably Rio Tinto and Is worth, export coal.
In June, Rio not was anymore able to use the iron way during about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the rail line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when one asked him if the Renamo would reiterate this threat.
The Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that the things go not well to the Mozambique", indicated Mr. Mazanga.
The instability reinforced the frustrations that gives rise to the government, declares Fernando Filed, director of Mediacoop, a corporation of independent media, many people equally being preoccupied by the corruption, the slowness of the development and the recent wave of abductions.
"The people think that the people in charge of the future of the country are the government and the president, and that this is at the latter to find solutions to the problems", it explained.
Omar Sultuane, a showing one, said that the people wanted only stability.
"No one is concerned with the Renamo or of the Frelimo, they want just to rediscover peace, they want have a free access to the roads", it added.

Coulson used telephone pirating to verify a pipe
The former editor in boss of New of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone pirating, the supervision and the confrontation" to attempt to confirm a pipe can on a liaison implying the minister of the then incumbent Interior, Charles Clarke.
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared in front of the court of the Old Bailey that New of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 according to which Clarke had a relation with Hannah Pawlby, his "pretty counsel special".
It was signaled to the course that the newspaper loaded Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate the vocal can of Pawlby and of "to plant in permanence in front of his door", but Coulson equally called it and left him vocal messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, that is henceforth the editor in boss of NotW, is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house of the people while hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to like to present the history to the people to see what they say some", declared Mr. Edis.
It declared that NotW used three means to investigate on the subjects: telephone pirating, the supervision and the confrontation.
The editor in boss personally is implied in the third one.
It is evident that it is during the course of the second one, the supervision, it do not can in being otherwise.
But that in is it first one?
Does it have knowledge of telephone pirating?
It asserts the opposite, but we say "of course that if".
The rumors on an implying liaison Clarke were resumed in first by the office of the compilation of NotW when a source, testing a sexual attirance towards Miss Pawlby, declared that one had said him: "Does not lose your time with her, she is with Charles."
A band, on which were recorded vocal messages pirated on his telephone to at least three returns, was seized to the residence of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators equally found seizures on the computer of the private detective that concerned Miss Pawlby and his orderly sisters in a file "Projects".
During the period where the detective investigated on her, the grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls where one asked them the news on her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the old one to put back in boss Neville Thurlbeck and the old one to put back James Weatherup supervised the supervision of the least facts and gestures of Miss Pawlby.
In a vocal message that it left him June 18 2005, Coulson said: "I have a history that we foresee to publish tomorrow of which I would like really to speak with Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the implication of Coulson in the history followed the same outline that with of other important men, such as the former minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett on the subject of a liaison with a married woman while frequented herself the co-défenderesse Rebekah Brooks, that was equally gotten married to this era.
Coulson and Brooks deny to have plotted with of others to pirate telephones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to have carried out telephone pirating.
Plan of salvage of 325 M$ intend for the system of health of the Tasmanie
The federal government maintains that the plan of salvage of 325 M$ intend for the system of unsteady health is matching strict conditions aiming to guarantee that the government of the State will not waste the funds.
The federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth takes currently of the "urgent measures" to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the insular state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The financing, foreseen on 4 years, was decided after the consultations of the government with the independent representative of Tasmanie, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government proposed a plan of salvage of urgency that, according to us, will regulate unique difficulties to which ones the State is confronted", declared Mrs Plibersek today.
The plan of 325 M$ understands a country of 31 M$ for the not urgent surgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, notably in the domain of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to recover the delay.
Funds are equally foreseen for the clinics without appointment to Hobart and Launceston, of better external cares, the formation of the medical frameworks, devoted services to mental health and the deployment of systems of electronic medical files in the local hospitals.
"These investments reply to the idea according to which, according to the clinicians of first line, it is a matter of the better means to care for the system of health of Tasmanie", declared Mrs Plibersek.
The minister asserted that the government of Tasmanie would be confronted to a strict system of preparation of the reports and of surrender of accounts.
The state will have to maintain the current levels of financing in order to receive money of the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A composed commission of three people will be constituted to guarantee that the State furnishes the services of the manner more effective and possible efficient.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the 325 M$ will not count for big thing "unless they are followed by an allowing true reformation to consolidate the system of public health of Tasmanie".
It nevertheless congratulated the government to have replied to the request of urgent assistance that it presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the plan of federal assistance will big contribute to withdraw the system of public health of Tasmanie of the black list", declared Mr. Wilkie.
According to the government of the State, these non urgent additional procedures will invert largely the recent cuttings.
But the Spokesperson of the opposition regarding health Peter Dutton thinks that the today announcement is an "a fortune solution".
"The reason we are here is that the Labor government of the State withdrew 430 M$ of his system of health", it declared on ABC TV.
One not can have a government of the State that pulls out almost a half billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 M$, and claim that this is an auspicious day.
Mr. Dutton returned visits to Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar of the plan of salvage will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
It walks in mud, the jungle and crosses rivers to offer a free medical assistance
The Dr Georges Bwelle exempts from the free health care in the towns of Cameroon
Dr Bwelle and his past teams almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There is not a lot of doctors in this country of western Africa, scarcely 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your movable device
The Dr Georges Bwelle is the one of the 10 Heroes CNN of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or the one of the 10 other heroes, to elect it "Hero CNN of the year".
This receive person 250 000 $ to follow his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to alternate the periods of conscience and of unconciousness and go in hospitals that were not equipped for him to provide assistance.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 close to Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, it had only an arm broken, but it contracted an infection that propagated itself until his brain, creating a hématome of which it was going to carry the séquelles remaining it of his life.
"There was not neurosurgeons to Cameroon", declared Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead of that, Dr Bwelle passed years to accompany his father in clinics and jam-packed hospitals, for that it obtains any treatment of which it could profit.
"This is not easy", adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house to 5 o'clock, you to kick to the hospital to be the first one, and you are not the first one.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they await too a long time.
The position not a lot changed since the death of the father of the Dr Bwelle in 2002.
To Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By way of comparison, the ratio to the United States is of 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonian one could not pay the consultation.
Two people on five in the country live underneath the poverty threshold, and almost three quarters of the expenditures of health of the country are realized in the private sector.
"The only problem that they have, this is poverty", explained the Dr Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot take advantage of life.
After seeing his father and as much of its compatriots suffering, the Dr Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of the things.
The Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteer ones practiced more than 700 surgical acts free during last year.
It became doctor himself, working as vascular surgeon to the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And it created a humanitarian association to non lucrative goal, ASCOVIME, that goes in the rural zones during the weekends to exempt from the free health care.
Since 2008, him and his group of volunteer ones helped close to 32 000 people.
Almost all the Fridays, with about thirty people, they pile up in small vans after setting up medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult lands to go in the towns that have the more need of assistance.
Luck follows them not always.
They have many times must to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received in hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and their offer the better available lodgings.
In these towns, the free health care are a good reason to do the party, and the Dr Bwelle – with his big one to smile and his overflowing energy – is happier to join itself to festivities.
The next day morning, the team begins receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people to every visit", declared Mr. Bwelle.
They live sometimes to 60 km of the town, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care are lavished.
Many people receive a treatment against the malaria, the tuberculosis, the malnutrition, the diabetes, the parasites and the sexually transmittable diseases.
Of others can receive kickstands, a pair of collected glasses or a certificate of free birth – necessary document to go to the school, but many poor families not all simply step can allow themselves to buy it.
Evenings, the team practices simple surgical acts under local anesthésie.
The operations are usually practiced in a school, a city hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes in the awakening room to leave his place to the following person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generating set, the room of operation and the sterilization of equipment, the Dr Bwelle and its volunteer ones work until the first hours on Sunday morning.
This is an exhausting rhythm, but the musicians of the towns help usually the team to remain motivated.
"They hit on drums the very night to hold us awake so that we could continue to work", explained Mr. Bwelle.
On Sundays, the team returns in city, tired but proud of the work that she accomplished.
The group, composed from Cameroonian doctors and of students in medicine, practiced 700 surgical acts free during last year, and it knows that their presence can do the very difference for those to that they provide assistance.
A man explained that the free operation that it had undergone to care for a hernia would allow him to work again.
"That will change my future and the one of my family", declared the man.
What's more to make this hospital live traveling and to work as surgeon to the hospital, the Dr Bwelle works also the night in medical offices private around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, it explains, that finances to 60% sounds association; the remainder is covered by private gifts.
"I know not when it sleeps", declared Katie O'Malley, a student in medicine in second year of the university Drexel to Philadelphia and volunteer within the group of the Dr Bwelle.
It always is to the hospital or in the process of trying to find money for his association in order to be able to take these countries.
For the students in medicine and them students nurses as Katie O'Malley, that come from the United States and of Europe to rejoin Mr. Bwelle in its missions, it is an apprenticeship occasion in the field that they have not at their place.
"One was able to participate in operations to help to mop up the blood or to let the instruments pass to the Dr Bwelle", explained Miss O'Malley.
This is not something that you have the occasion to do in America when you are studying in medicine in second year.
The volunteer students pay usually travels them to the Cameroon, and arrive often with medical collected equipment.
But once to Yaoundé, their pension, their transportation and the teaching are taken charge of by the doctor Bwelle.
"This is a hero, there is not doubt", declared Katie O'Malley.
It gives his life for this association, and his craving to help the Cameroonian people is not close to to extinguish itself.
For Dr Bwelle, the load of comparatively constant work is not a difficulty.
Help the others to live happy while holding the promise that it did to his father is something that brings him an immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work", added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope that it sees what I do.
Let the people laugh and relieve the pain are the reasons that urge me to do that.

The two France of Rock Nora
Perplexed, the university a long time pained to define and to situate Rock Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and the course rooms?
Doubtless, but while underlining his weak one for the shortcuts, Sciences po, the High Etudes.
Referee of the works of others in his office of the street gaston-gallimard?
In fact, but in ignorant the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Did heir of the armchair that occupy Fontenelle to the French Academy?
Of course again, but while knowing that a such consecrates would not know to replace the true holy oil, the one of the thesis, of which it happened.
They gladly recognized in him a big éveilleur, coordinator and federal of their works, but while pointing out that it showed himself not very inclined to in to produce itself.
To this uncertain picture the monument of the "memory Places", to which one it attached his name, also contributed.
The mean languages there were able to see a gigantic market to the fleas, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a lively blow of eye and ballasted with erudition, but incurable amateur.
The two works published by Nora here soon two years already established that the one that passed in order not to to write had a lot and well written.
The book that here him should return definitively justice.
One there rediscovers nevertheless, once more, the temptation of ubiquity, wandering intellectual, jubilation begun jumping as on foot joined of a subject to the other.
But one understands quickly that the varied objects mustered in this book to the so beautiful title bring back the bric-a-brac trader to a single one and even passion: the one to discover the constituent knot of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is an era preoccupation.
Here little, we collectively were invited to some to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of then, the French identity was a timeless gasoline.
It was necessary only to deploy the accidents, and the matter, jacobinisme obliges, was confided in the prefects and to the under prefects, interpret authorized.
The one that stalks Rock Nora is any other.
It does not put himself in heir of an eternal francité, it refuses himself to the definition.
Worried analyst of a familiar strangeness, it wanders in a symbol forest, stopped to every step by an object in form of rébus, tormented irritating questions.
Of which this one, that is born of the business itself: why, in a so country durably installed in its borders, so formerly robust and solidly built, hears one these dramatic calls to unity?
They are not so urgent, suggests Rock Nora, that to avert the born disturbance of the discords of the French history.
Frank and Gallic, Armagnacs and Burgundian, Catholic and Protestant: the division forces, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic one is evidently the one that splits in two the national history.
As of earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, the a monarchic, the revolutionary other.
The second wanted the death of the first one, but without succeeding in deny it; concerned on the contrary of some to rediscover the sacralité and so much eagerer of unity and of indivisibility than she had cut the head to the one that some was the evident one and powerful incarnation.
And, of there, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and upright, secularity and Catholicism, adoration and hate of the revolution.
To let this oddity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so well that the American escapade of Rock Nora well being the heart of his book.
For America and France have the one and the other done a revolution, composed a declaration of the rights, wanted to be founded a corporation nine.
But the American cousinage does only more better to underline what we is clean.
Over there, men that had left their Former System in England and no longer had at about it to be concerned.
Here, men clutter with a native Former System, and so much more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and the preserved one.
There founding always honored fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors of which one pains to do the models, and that are themselves killed each other remainder.
There an institutional consistency, and here a waterfall of constitutions, as as much of errors to recover and of essays to resume.
The France that leaves, the France that comes
It there nevertheless had an era where the French believed to be able to sew up the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the figure two.
To this IIIe Republic, central moment and creator, Rock Nora showed a lot of interests and even of kindness: greeting those that then employed itself to repair the revolutionary break, while teaching to the pupils all that in the former France prepared obscurely modern France and while their proposing a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity had only a time.
The here again some debates, jostled by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the climbed protest minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book offers therefore at once the fascinating portrait of the France that leaves and the cautious sketch of the France that comes.
With, in premium, the portrait of the historian, that should reserve some surprises.
One there discovers that the vagrant was a homebody.
The man of the multiple curiosities turned, lightly obsessional, around a same idea.
The edge prowler was anxious the center of the center.
And the one that had deposited, here more of a half century, a subject on the nation idea, but had subtracted itself to the initiatory exercise of the thesis, we confide, cum grano soil, that it will have finished by to do it.
Of course under a less stiff form, done more burst and more subtle.
But let's not cheat there, all so constraining one.
For well more than the taxed face of the university program, said this thesis the internal necessity of a life.
How biometry will invade our lives
Finished the passwords to type to attain his smartphone or to pay its purchases?
The American, French or Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will have recognized by the biometric sensors of the telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, assistant general director of Morpho, estimates even that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometry will allow assuring itself realizing identity of a person of the transactions in a universe also transverse and transnational as Internet.
The dedicated organizations to the protection of private life confirm this fad for biometry, but itself in worry.
Nothing that in 2011 and in France, the national Commission of data processing and liberties authorized 774 systems of recognition of the impressions, form of the hand or network streaks hand in businesses, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone soon will be able to be identified, anywhere and does not import when", moves itself Justin Brookman, person in charge of private life of the consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), to Washington.
The such a optimism reasons, with the one, and pessimisme, with the others?
Biometry will lean on of new techniques, that will allow returning again services to the citizens and to the consumers.
Today, in France, the biometric data the done more use are the fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the network streaks palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques possesses its constraints.
"For example, certain people that work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their impressions are illegible", notes Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain with Thales Communications & Security.
And the anthology as well as the verification of the network streaks and outline of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture the people.
This is at once a security - one not can obtain these data to their unawareness - and an inconvenience: the procedure sometimes must be repeated and takes therefore time.
Consequence, research are taken since about twenty years on of others approach, as the recognition of the face or iris (the colored party of the eye).
Thanks to the increase of the precision of the sensors and capacity of calculation of the necessary computers to the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
The precision of the facial recognition was multiplied by ten during the five last years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the laboratories of R&D of Accenture in Europe.
With our assistance, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed posts borders automatic using the facial recognition.
It is henceforth possible to identify a face or an iris in movement.
"Today, we take research on the recognition of voice or manner to walk using sonorous sensors, but it is necessary a silent environment", indicates Sridhar Iyengar, director of the research on the security to the Intel Labs.
Unique marker and infalsifiable, the DNA gives rise to equally hopes and worries.
"In the current state of the knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie vulliet-tavernier, director of the studies, innovation and forecast to the CNIL.
But the analysis of the DNA is again very long and very costly.
NEC proposes to the judicial police force a costing suitcase 90,000 Euros to analyze samples of DNA on the place of a crime and in an hour.
The usages of biometry divide up themselves in two groups: the identification (to recognize a person among of others) and the authentication (to assure itself that the person is the one that she claims to be).
The identification concerned so far the delivery of papers of identity: it is necessary to confront the biometric elements (impressions, photo, iris) with the news that the State possesses on all the already put ones on file citizens.
That allows assuring itself that one no one stretched not to usurp the identity of someone of other.
This comparison principle can have other applications.
NEC proposes thus the recognition of VIP to the entry of a hotel or of a store.
"We recover the pictures of the movie cameras of supervision and the compare to the photos of the fame that freely circulate on Internet", explains Dany Nassif, loaded, with NEC France, commercial development for the solutions of biometric identification.
Other usage: to take in photo a quidam that does the tail in a store, follow his progression thanks to the facial recognition and calculate the expectation time.
The authentication concerned at the start the physical accesses (borders, local protected, canteens. ..) or logical (opening of a computer).
Itself there added, more recently, the presence check.
"A biometric timekeeper avoids the phenomenon of the buddy that not at all for another", justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, more and more, the authentication will concern also the transactions, in particular the one realized from connected devices to Internet.
To Japan, it already is possible to withdraw money to certain distributors while introducing his card and while putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit with the secret code.
A similar technique is tested to Villeneuve-d'Ascq and to Angoulême by the corporation Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of the big distribution: at to pay in store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger in a reader that scanne the veins.
Experimentation is foreseen to last six months.
If she is conclusive, the biometric readers soon could arrive with the French merchants.
Tracks to reassure the users
It exists three manners to return enticing biometry to the eyes of the general public.
The first one is to explain that she can do to save time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a customer remains in cash register thirty seconds of less, it is noticeable", explains the director of a hypermarket.
The second one is to offer personalized services: in some years, a vocal waiter will be able to recognize your voice and you to propose options on measure.
And, at last, reassure while putting forward the taken precautions to protect the data bases.
"The fingerprints are stocked on a first waiter; the identities of the people are in a second bases: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stocked in a highly reassured case, that blocks itself if one stretched to move it", enumerates Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, for lack of deepened studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches convince really the users.
The specialists of the protection of private life, them, continue to worry.
"The progress of the facial recognition, the multiplication of the movie cameras of supervision and the huge quantity of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, do me to fear the worse one: a generalized supervision", predicts Andrew Patrick, Commissionership to the protection of private life to Canada.
Frontier Airlines envisions to let the hand luggage pay
Frontier Airlines envisions to do to pay until 100 $ to the passengers that transport hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines envisions to begin doing to pay until 100 $ for a hand luggage and 2 $ for a coffee or a soda, although in his announcement Wednesday, she indicated that the passengers could take the non open canette with them to the descent of the airplane.
The new expenses of hand luggage concern the orderly bags in the superior compartment, therefore the small installed bags under the seat will always be free.
Frontier declared that she would do to pay 25 $ if the expenses were paid in advance and 100 $ if the travelers paid only once to the boarding door.
The spokesperson of Frontier, Kate O'Malley indicated that the 100 $ were foreseen to incite the travelers to pay the expenses in advance.
"We do not want to let this price pay", she explained.
The airline companies began let the first one pay and second recorded luggage in 2008.
The passengers that tried to avoid these expenses put as much things as they could in the orderly hand luggage in the superior compartments, thus it did not have often more place in these compartments.
These expenses are a means to assure itself that the passengers transport less than things on board.
O'Malley declared that these new expenses will serve not really to collect money.
It is a matter to do to understand to the customers of Frontier more faithful than it becomes more and more difficult to find place in the superior compartments.
The passengers that buy their ticket on the site of the airline company will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger done the tail to a door of boarding Frontier could transport a bag free, while the following person in the tail could must pay 100 $ for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the site and the procedures of recording of Frontier are changing to guarantee that the known passengers the existence of these expenses before arriving to the door.
The expenses of hand luggage of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date was set up.
The passengers grumble often about the expenses of luggage and fresh other, but the airline companies love them.
They consider that the costs of handling of the luggage are important and that the passengers that want this service should pay it.
Good number of people to Wall Street consider the addition of expense of luggage as a sign that proves that the airline companies do to pay rather dear to cover the cost of the aerial trip after the loss years.
Nevertheless good number of them did not touch on the luggage expenses.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first expenses of hand luggage three years ago, and the company low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.
The other only imposing company of such fresh is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, declared the consultant one with airline companies Jay Sorensen, that follows by near the expenses in supplement.
It estimated, in a report of December 2011, that the expenses of hand luggage of Spirit retrieved 50 M$ per year.
Sorensen, a former framework of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what it was going to find to the boarding door the moment the passengers would discover the expenses of unusual hand luggage taxed by the company.
"I had never seen a procedure of boarding so fluid of all my professional career", it declared.
I expected to see gratings of teeth and a scuffle to burst to the door.
The airplane was full, it added, "the passengers brought up on board at the speed of light".
Frontier done equally as Spirit and applies expenses of 2 $ for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that the passengers that take a soda or a fruit juice can take the non open canette with them, and those that take coffee can be served again free.
She will always distribute water free.
US Airways briefly attempted to do to pay for the drinks in 2008 but went back seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other big airline company had followed.
The decision of Frontier to let expenses of hand luggage pay when the passengers buy not directly their ticket with the airline company constitutes his last effort to incite the customers to go on his site.
The airline companies pay to the salesmen of online trips as Orbitz 10 $ to 25 $ for every sold ticket.
That incited all the airline companies to encourage the passengers to buy directly with them instead of to address to itself an agency of online trip.
Nevertheless, Frontier went further in this domain.
In September, she began to offer only the half of miles of fidelity to the customers that bought their ticket through an agency of online trip.
Wednesday, she reduced the premiums of miles of 25% on a trip.
Thus, a trip Frontier de1 000 miles bought with an agency of online trip would allow winning 250 miles.
She allows equally to the passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly their ticket on the site of Frontier.
Frontier has a faithful clientele in his origin city, Denver, but his activity backs up and she loses money.
The recipes fell of 9% and his flight capacity diminished of almost 13% during the first quarter, according to the financial published results Wednesday by his corporation mother, Republic Airways holding Companies Inc.
Republic attempted to rectify the finances of Frontier while selling the airline company.
Scientists have just put in light the manner of which the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood.
Of preceding studies had revealed that the happy dogs stirred more their tail towards the right (from the standpoint dog), while the nervous dogs stirred it more towards the left.
But henceforth the said scientists that the dogs can detect these subtle differences and there to reply.
The Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientifique of the university of Thirty, declared: "Everyone knows that, with the man, the left side and the straight side of the brain are implied in a different way in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions".
Here, we tried to see what it was some with of other types.
It added that just like with the man, with the dogs the straight side of the brain was responsible of the movement towards the left and vice poured, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
For in to know more on the manner of which the dogs react to the disorderly movements of tail of other dogs, the researchers followed by the animals in the process of looking at films where figured other dogs.
They measured the cardiac frequency of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will be necessary surely not a long time before we understood why their tail goes sometimes on one hand and sometimes other.
The Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs of the films where figured other dogs – is a naturalist version is an outline to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able trafiquer the movement of the tail and to present it as avenue to the left or to right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression to stir the tail towards the right (from the standpoint dog that stirs the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail to principally deviate towards the left (once more from the standpoint dog that stirs the tail), their cardiac frequency is itself accelerated and they seemed anxious.
The Professor Vallortigara said that it did not think that the dogs communicated deliberately between them thanks to these movements.
It thinks rather than the dogs know by experience the movements of which they should or do not worry.
It added: "If you meet at several returns of other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail towards a side is associated with a friendlier attitude and than the straight side induces a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
The researchers indicate that the results could allow the owners, to the veterinarians and to the more better to apprehend trainers the emotions of their animals.
The expert in canine behavior John Bradshaw, invited professor to the School of the veterinary sciences of the university of Bristol, specified that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right with the canine type.
Last year, a team of the university of Lincoln discovered that the dogs turned the head towards the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and towards the right when it was a matter of a joyous dog.
And in another scientific study realized by the university of Victoria to Canada, it declared: "The dogs went more easily towards a dog robot when his tail stirred towards the left rather than towards the right, instead of becoming anxious – the inverse one of what figures in the Italian study."
It indicated that the differences could come on account of the fact that the dogs having participated in the different studies considered not completely the animals of the films or the dogs robots as dogs.
A study on the manner of which the dogs react facing of true dogs could be useful, it explained.
"Although many elements, raised with different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used to different ends, good number of details again must be specified – and the dogs do not do exception", it declared.
Nevertheless, being given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will be necessary surely not a long time before we understood why their tail budges sometimes on one hand and sometimes other.
Launch of a shop of incidental ones for Google Tolls
An online shop, proposing incidental multiples dedicated to Google Tolls, has just been put at the disposal of the thousands of developers possessing a prototype of the connected signed glasses Google.
They can thus obtain a receiver, a magazine or well again a holster of tidying up.
This shop, strictly reserved to the developers already disposing Google Tolls, proposes some incidental such as a magazine and his cable USB, for 50$.
For the same price, it is so possible to obtain a slip-cover of made protection in microphone fibers or a receiver little finger.
Although Google works currently on a model of Google Tolls equipped glasses of correction, no date back to marketing on a large scale again was not confirmed.
Live together in French, the challenge of the school commission marguerite-bourgeoys
To the school commission marguerite-bourgeoys, 62% of the students have another mother tongue that the French.
It is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with the parents, students, professors and members of the personnel of the education, to reflect to the means of more better to integrate the students that live to horse between several cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled his vision of the "To Live together in French".
The organism Vision variety takes a walk since a year in the schools to help the students of all origins to discover common indicators that do not limit themselves to the French language.
The neighborhood discovery, our architecture, our places are indicators.
Big names of writers, of artists, that they are stump or that they came besides.
Who are our master-builders?
"Therefore, one creates projects so that they identify themselves to all that", explains the president of Vision variety, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is the Quebec culture, the membership feeling, the support to the personnel in the transformations that one lives, within the studying clientele", it enumerates.
The school commission marguerite-bourgeoys created a research center that will give tools to the professors that, them also sometimes, come besides.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, some will be the scientific director.
The preparation for to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies, this is that the true need", she summarizes.
The research will concern the inclusion under all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
Obama puts an end to the listen aiming the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama gave order to the national Agency of security (NSA) to put an end to the listen that she practiced on the international monetary Funds and the World Bank in the framework of its activities of piece of information, indicates an American person in charge, Thursday.
This decision is part of the attempt of the white House to resume the hand in the matter of the listen NSA after the revelations done by the former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
It is the first time that is mentioned the supervision of the IMF and World Bank by the piece of information agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned on the subject, a person in charge of the American administration replied: "The United States do not take any electronic supervision aiming the seats of the World Bank and IMF to Washington".
Expressing itself under the seal of the anonymity, this person in charge did not specify if such a supervision had been set up by the passed.
An official other has, him, indicated that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices during the past weeks.
This instruction was given almost to the same moment that the one putting an end to the listen general neighborhood of the UN to New York.
In this context, the senatorial Commission of the piece of information approved Thursday a reinforcement of the checks on the governmental programs of supervision but authorized their pursuit.
The commission established new restrictions on the data that the piece of information agencies are authorized to collect and imposed a limit of five years for the conservation of these information.
The European stock Markets in decrease to the mi-séance, safe London
With the exception of London, the principal European stock Markets evolve in lowers Friday to mi-séance, sealed by certain new of disappointing corporations, while Wall Street is awaited in increase.
Besides, the investors remain prudent for they consider that the American federal Reserve could undo his politics of softening quantitative earlier that foreseen.
On the other hand, after the announcement of an inflation to 0.7% for the body of the Euro zone, the idea sheds itself among the actors of the market that the European central Bank (CEB) could soften his monetary policy.
The future ones of Wall Street leave to presage an opening of the American actions in increase, after two consecutive meetings of fold.
To the values, Renault (-4,63%) records the strongest fold of the CAC 40, sealed by the warning on result of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the most bad performance of l'EuroFirst300, after to have equally published results in decrease this morning and announced the creation internally of a structure of défaisance ("bad bank") grouping together 38 billions pounds of active ones the done more risk.
Of his side, Vodafone (+2,45%) maintains itself in head of the increases of l'EuroFirst300 in reaction to an information of wanting press that AT&T studies an eventual OPA.
On the market of the change, the speculations on the evolution of the monetary policy of the CEB go good train, as some testifies John Hardy, strategist with Saxo Bank.
The unique mandate of the CEB always concerned the inflation, therefore Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the time of the next week meeting.
We anticipate a potential fort of lowers Euro.
In this context, the Euro follows his fold against the American change and touched in meeting a more bottom of two weeks to 1.3517 dollars.
These same conjectures support to the inverse one walked it bond of the Euro zone.
This judgement means that a text of adopted law in July in this State and putting back widely in cause the right to the abortion will be able to enter in force.
Classical song for adolescent
Every time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had known a lot of successes during the preceding season.
Through five imagined and interpreted skits by artists of the region, labels consisting of a strong dose of humor, one allows adolescent to tame the classical song.
Besides this spectacle, the Corporation of lyric art of the Kingdom will return with its lyric Destinations, a formula that does henceforth room fills to the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place at the summer 2014, which gives the luck to artists of the region to show of what they are capable.
To these activities added the lyric Apéritif, the concert profit held in last August, with the competition of the soprano coloratura Mary ève Munger.
It was a matter of an activity profit, alongside the artistic dimension, and she helped the non-profit organism to produce a financial report that is so soft to the ears as an air of The bat.
Without delivering precise figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage encounter of held press yesterday, to Chicoutimi, to show itself reassuring.
Despite the pigeon fancying that is the batch of cultural so many institutions, the future draws well, even in the long term.
We have solider supports and constant.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last to THE 50E anniversary of the operetta, a step that we will cross in seven years", commented on the administrator.
"I would say even beyond", added the general director, Hélène Gaudreault, in smiling.
The Congolese army pourchasse the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its unities went pourchasser the rebels of the M23 even in their situated bases in the forests and the mountains of the North kivu bordering the Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of to be beaten after hunting localities of the northeast of the democratic Republic of Congo (RDC) that it checked since the beginning, 20 months ago, insurrection.
"We will follow the M23 and to corner it wherever it hides himself because it is a matter of criminals", declared to Reuters the colonel Olive Tree Hamuli, spokesperson of the FARDC.
We must not leave them to reorganize themselves because they torment the Congolese people since too a long time.
The time had just to bring back peace.
People in charge of the M23 explained to have evacuated the localities under the diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, person in charge politics of rebellion, asserted on RFI that these military backs not would modify at all its claims to the peace talks.
The latter, according to the mediators ougandais, resumed Wednesday to Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are signaled in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality to the hands of the rebel ones to have fallen this week, as well as to the surroundings of Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 saw the light of day in 2012.
To their apogee in November, the rebel ones occupied Goma, administrative center of the province of the North kivu, taking advantage escape of the governmental garrison and passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma brought the Mission of the united Nations in RDC, the most important one to the world in terms of effective ones, to reinforce his mandate and to form a quick brigade of composed intervention of south african soldiers, malawites and tanzaniens.
Of his side, the staff of the FARDC was modified and the army is passed to the offensive against the M23, doing to change the course of the war.
The rhythm of progression of the governmental troops is today unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to touch on his end", predicts an expert of the Congolese matters, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - this would be the first time that the government of Kinshasa succeeds beating a major insurrection.
And this would be also the first time since 1996 as no armed group allied to the Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
Experts of the united Nations accuse the Rwanda, that the been born fiercely, to support militarily the M23, constituted at the start of Congolese mutinous former military officers.
The boss of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the president rwandais Paul Kagame to show withholding, announced a spokesperson of the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had evoked the possibility of military reprisals following the fallen shells in territory rwandais.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of the soldiers of the FARDC.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it we appeared unthinkable to be a day liberated by the army", testifies an inhabitant of this bordering locality of the Uganda.
"We lived in the terror (of the M23), we traumatized", added this man.
John Kerry admitted, does unprecedented, that the American spying "had gone too far in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry indicated a radoucissement of the defensive attitude of the United States with respect to its supervision programs while admitting, does unprecedented, that to several occasions, the spying "had gone too far in an inappropriate way".
The secretary of state equally admitted that it had, just as Barack Obama, governed on "automatic pilot" when a series of inflammatory revelations of the denunciatory Edward Snowden on the subject of the activities of spying of the NSA saw the light of day.
The escapes put the American government to the diplomatic center of a storm with its allies.
Expressing itself at the time of an intergovernmental lecture to London by video liaison, Mr. Kerry declared: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and of other members of the government peruseed certain things in method pilot automatic because we in had the possibility, as early as the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course September 11."
It next became the first member of high row of the government of the United States to admit that the American spying had surpassed the boundaries, but insisted on the Fact that the rights of each had not been violated.
It declared: "In certain cases, this went too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is resolved to attempt to clarify and specify clearly to the people that it proceeded now to a deepened réexamen of these practices so that no one feels cheated.
I assure you that the innocent people will not be victims of abuse in the framework of this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, nevertheless, on the Fact that the NSA was an effective force for the good and that its supervision operations had saved many lives.
It added: "We live in a new world where the people are ready to do itself to jump."
It exists a radical extremism in the world that is determined to attempt to kill people, to do them to explode and attack the governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and to stop them before they act?
We beautiful airplanes and well prevented from the airplanes to fall, buildings to explode and people to be murdered because we were able to peruse the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, the American legislators will go in Europe to reply to the preoccupations concerning the American presumed spying matter and convince the Europeans of the necessity to follow the joint efforts of fights against the terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the president of the under committee of the Senate on the European matters.
The senator Chris Murphy of the Connecticut indicated that it had expressed himself in front of the members of the European Parliament and of others this week and that it was worried of the threats that they had hurled concerning a possible collection of the anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration feeling that gives rise to the supervision of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of the national security to the United States that the Europeans remain at our sides in the mutual engagement in the fight against the terrorism", declared Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the under commission of the European matters of the American Senate, at the time of a discussion since Washington.
And I will return in Europe for well to do them to understand that we must continue to work together to fight against the terrorism, despite anger provoked by the programs of the NSA.
The press retrieves that the NSA obtained millions of communications in Europe, which put to poorly the relations with certain allies of the United States, nevertheless the director of the agency declared this week that it was inexact and that it was a matter of a misunderstanding for that concerned métadonnées that the allies of NATO had collected and divided with the United States.
Of other revelations mentioned documents divulged by Snowden according to which these the NSA had intercepted data and communications emanating portable telephone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel and of those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of the services of piece of information, James To Click, justified the spying of the allies while indicating that it was necessary and that it was a matter of a current practice of the two sides.
In this commotion atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office organized a trip of the Congress, that should take place this year, and that it hoped that the delegation would understand members of the two parties and of the two rooms.
The names of the other participating legislators should be unveiled in the days to come.
It indicated that the itinerary remained to define.
Murphy declared that the goal of this trip was to allow improving relations, but equally to show "affectionate firmness".
It explained that the European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens on the subject of the type of programs of spying that they apply themselves since years.
"We can modify our supervision programs in order more better to protect the rights of the Europeans, but they also must understand as we are not the only ones in the world to do the spying", declared Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry foresaw to go this weekend to the Middle East and in Poland to manage resentment generated by the American strategies in Syria, in Egypt and in Iran, as well as by the activities of supervision of the United States.
The call of Scott Brown rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of the Celtic Glasgow, saw his rejected call and will well be suspended for the two next matches of League of the champions of his club, against the Ajax and the AC Milan.
Expelled against the Barça to have addressed a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment saw his extensive suspension to three meet by the UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club was said "very disappointed", considering that his call completely was justified.
For the CEO of Titan, "the project of purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts up with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge with crash in January for the partial return of the site Goodyear of promised amiens-nord to the closing, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumaticien Titan, declares itself, today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive turnaround, already had announced it, Monday October 21.
After renouncing the project of purchase of the factory in January, you return today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, while talking about "so-called workers", that "work three hours" a day, of unions "crazy", while aiming the CGT.
One does not understand this about-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I do not try to please anybody.
Safe to my woman.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charm young man that stretched to save industrial jobs among the more better paid.
If I injured someone by my words, I am grieved some.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment also.
Does the truth you injure?
Work seven hours a day when in of other countries one works eight hours handicaps France.
In India, in China and in a lot of other countries, one works ten at twelve o'clock a day.
But I do not have any prejudices on France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipments, is well situated and has access to spaces to enlarge itself.
Why does Titan have so need of this factory?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, that is worth the blow to try.
Which type agreed do you await between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closing of the factory, Goodyear had offered to the employees a good compensation of departure, I think that 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys to Goodyear machines it closed.
From that time, Titan could move the machines towards the Poland or about any other country of the European Union that has again his own change.
I think that Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Now, it wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan accepts recruiting them among the some 1 200 current employees of Goodyear.
Also Mr. Montebourg needs an engagement of Titan before trying to bring the CGT to sit to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on the departure compensation for all the employees.
From that time, there will be no longer any employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs during four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number that I mentioned to the minister, this is 333.
I know that it would want a guarantee of four years.
But, as I said it for you, the CGT and Goodyear have first to come to an agreement on compensation of departure.
If all the employees the accept, the project of purchase of the factory starts up with zero employee.
How can we give guarantees of length of job when it no longer remains employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in what the CGT and Goodyear come to an agreement and that Titan buys the factory, we have well the intention to remain at more than four amiens-nord years.
The airport of Los Angeles evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at the international airport of Los Angeles.
It was 10h00 in the morning local hour when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injureds.
It would be a matter of a working employee for the Administration for the security of the transportations of the United States (TSA) and author of the gunshots.
The incident would have produced itself to the final one 3, provoking a panic wave.
The travelers and the personnel rushed towards the gone out or on the tarmac.

The supreme Court validates the law of reformation of the system of health of Obama
Big victory for the administration Obama: the American supreme Court declared today that the law of reformation of the system of health ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable For Act (law on the protection of the patients and the reasonable cares) – that demands that the citizens subscribe a health insurance of here 2014, under penalty of to have to pay a fine – and declared that it was constitutional by virtue of the strength of imposition of the government.
The president of the supreme Court, John Roberts, rallied itself to the four members the more liberals of the Course, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Course equally validated the other sections of the law of 2 700 pages and has, besides, considered that the disposal of the law of reformation of the system of health, that stipulates that it is necessary to lower the eligibility threshold to Medicaid under penalty of to lose all the federal financings of the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The aiming procedure to block the law was engaged by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the big republican candidates to the presidential election in lists during the primary ones of 2012, including the designated candidate Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed itself to the law.
Aretha Franklin will climb back up on scene in December
The newspaper Detroit New retrieves that the queen of the soul will produce itself December 21 to the room Sound Board of the hotel MotorCity Casino.
Mrs Franklin herself matter in November to the recording of an album for Cleaves Davis and Sony Music, produces by Gift Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease of which she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had asserted to the media October 16 that the secondary effects of a treatment that she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be return".
It would be necessary to teach the myths and legends to the children as "models of style of life", declares the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not do the weight facing the subtle trick", while the legends arthuriennes reveal the importance to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "well too violent, well too scandalous and in certain cases, well too obscene to be taught to the school", crossley-holland recommended a "meticulous selection" adapted works to the age.
"I find tremendous that in America, the myths and the done already left folklore of the education", it said.
I plead in favor of this project for 20 years.
It added that the Fact that the authors and teaching them are "educational ouvertement" does that the children "unhook completely", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant histories.
Crossley-holland, that translated Beowulf of the Anglo-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Bruise, declared: "You have maybe good intention, but you prefer to keep them outside view."
Maybe that the big difference between a writing adult author for the adults and a writing adult author for the children is necessitated it to offer hope.
Not that all must be simplified or finish well, but it exists an innate direction of the good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The known basis of what one shows and that one does not say.
Green light of the United States to the publicis-omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday not to have received any objection from American authorities to their merger, comparing itself thus creation of the first agency of world-wide advertising.
The merger compares in fact the second world-wide agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.

New request of collective recourse against the Holy brothers Cross
A new request of collective recourse was deposited against the Holy brothers Cross, concerning sexual aggressions that would have unfolded themselves this time to the Holy oratorical joseph as well as in several orphanages, high schools and schools.
Request leans on the testimony of the requiring, identified as "J. J "., that would have been masturbé in the years 1950, first to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor the Submissive brother, then by his confessor, the father Bernard, to the Holy oratorical joseph, where it was using mass and where his father worked as painter.
The first recourse aimed only three establishments, and when one announced the regulation, a lot of people said us: "Me, I was at such place, I can register myself?", relates the lawyer Alain Arsenault, that defends the victims in the two recourses.
Collective recourse that has just been deposited has for characteristic to allow the addition of complaining about any establishment where of physical cruelty could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Holy Cross.
At the present time, meets recourse the complaints of 25 people that assert to have been attacked by the Holy brothers Cross.
The alleged facts are in older general than those mentioned in the first recourse, since several of the aimed establishments closed their doors in the years 1960.
Recourse underlines besides that the congregation of Holy Cross and the Holy oratorical joseph, that is a distinct entity, "allowed that of sexual physical cruelty are perpetrated in opposition to children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were during the course of sexual perpetrated physical cruelty and the nevertheless stifled", and that they have "knowingly and chosen consciemment to be unaware of the problematic one".
The latter accusations base themselves among others on letters composed by the lawyer of the Holy brothers Cross, Me Émile Perrin, in the years 1990, but also by the research done in the archives to this subject by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Holy Cross that denounced publicly physical cruelty.
Collective recourse has first past the step of the admissibility in Superior Court.
Once admissibility is admit by the Course, one proceeds to the second step, is the hearing on the bottom.
In the case of the first recourse, the congregation of Holy Cross had accepted regulating to the by private agreement one before of hearing are taken on the bottom.
RDC: the prepared army a new assault
Children play on an armored charred one that belonged to the rebels of the M23, to Kibumba, October 31 2013, in the East of the RDC.
The Congolese army got ready Friday to a new assault against the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 close to Bunagana, in the East of the RDC.
The objective is to evict the M23 hills that overhang Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, that overhangs the one of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall of itself.
It no longer will remain than the hill of Runyonyi.
"The one of Chanzu is not very strategic", indicated has the AFP the governor of the North kivu, Julian Paluku.
Mr. Paluku foresees to go Saturday has Bunagana.
Political fief and last strong place of rebellion, this locality is situated to the border ougandaise, to about 80 km to the north of Goma.
She was resumed Wednesday by the armed Forces of the democratic Republic of Congo Wednesday.
Since, some hundreds of irreducible ones of the M23, are subtracted to near of 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close of Bunagana and locality neighbors Jomba
To Jomba, an inhabitant that had mentioned fight all close Thursdays during all day long indicated that the position was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and his child were killed by the fight of the day before and were buried.
A girl was injured by bullet, and three other people were injured, of which a seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.

The course blocks a decision relating to politics of checks and of search of the NYPD
A court of federal appeals blocked Thursday the exacting decision of a judge of the changes in the program of check and of search of the department of police of New York and removed it from the file.
The court of appeals of the United States (second circuit) indicated that the decision of the judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the coming from the call lodged by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution after the implement of his aiming program to check and to question the citizens.
The city appealed its conclusions and of its corrective orders, notably an aiming decision to attribute an inspector to help the police department to modify his political one and the formation program that is associated him.
The court of appeals heard Tuesday the arguments concerning the suspension request.
The court of appeals declared that the judge had to be removed from the file for she infringed the code of driving of the judges while compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid any partiality appearance, in left because of a discussion series granted to the media and of public declarations in which these she reacted publicly to the critics of the course.
The judge had ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people while targeting to wrong of the black men and of origin Hispanic in the framework of their program of check and of search.
She designated an exterior inspector to supervise the modifications, notably the reformation of the political, formation and supervision, and she ordered set it up of a program pilots to test movie cameras reaches on the body in the neighborhoods where unfold themselves the biggest number of checks.
In August, the city of New York accepted putting an end to the solid practice to preserve the names and address people of which the case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the call lodged by the city should take place after March 14 2014.
The tactics of the check and search was criticized by many defender of the civil rights.
This system of check and of search exists since decades under a certain form, but the number of recorded checks increased in a manner spectacular under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to attain his higher historic level in 2011 with 684 330 checks that principally concerned black men and of origin Hispanic.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all originating one of minorities, and transformed itself in collective action.
The supporters advocating changes in the program of check and of search of the said NYPD that they will put an end to the unfair practices, will allow having forces of more effective police and to which ones one does confidence, and will be able to change the manner of which the police departments make use of the political one.
The opposing say that these changes would mine the morale of the police without let the crime lower, would represent a waste of money and would not resolve the wider problem of force police under pressure after the effective ones of policemen strongly were reduced during the course of the last decade.
The judge underlined that she did not put fine to the practices of check and of search, that are constitutional, but that she reformed the manner of which the NYPD implemented its checks.
The revelations of the NSA increase the paranoia of the businesses with regard to the supervision of State
By a beautiful day of fine August, a helicopter of the German police flew across down with altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On order of the federal Office of protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of German pieces of information, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, situated to less than 5 km of the European central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the antenna presence of listen and that the operation gave rise to an exchange between the United States and the ministry of the German foreign Affairs to Berlin.
James To Click, the director of the American services of piece of information, insisted again in September on the Fact that the United States do not use their regarding piece of information foreign capacities for "to fly the industrial secrets of the foreign businesses for the account of American corporations in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since that Edward Snowden, the consultant denunciatory become one, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of the supervision of the United States, the European governments and the business leaders no longer know if it is necessary to believe the director on word.
Reports, according to which these the National Security Agency American spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to held data by American suppliers of services of storage in the Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, more than ever gave rise to the paranoia of the businesses with regard to the supervision of State.
The revelation according to which telephones it German chancellor Angela Merkel had been pirated, maybe even for a decade, was the drop of water that did to overflow the vase.
If the person more powerful of Europe can be aimed, then the leaders of business are surely also targets potentielles.
Snowden rendered transparent the intensive collaboration between the American services of piece of information and the businesses.
I consider that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must awaken", declares Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, that represents the German SMES of the sector of the TI.
The German corporations think that the United States represent an as important risk as China when it is a matter of industrial spying and of flight of data, according to a published investigation in July by the office of counsel EY.
Nevertheless in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates to this day that the United States transmitted industrial secrets of foreign businesses to American corporations.
The politicians were part of their worry to the idea that THE E.U. does not dispose any computer capacities and sufficient Internet and think that she should strive to reduce his dependance with respect to the United States.
The business leaders are skeptical to this subject.
A representative of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only to close the eyes and to reopen them slowly...
"This is not the good manner to do", indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the corporation of software of German business, SAP.
If one wanted an European industry of the strong TI, then it was not necessary to leave it to die 20 years ago.
All is subsidized in Germany, coal to the cars, while going through the farmers.
All safe the industry of the TI.
Nevertheless, extent and the sophistication of the American agencies of spying exposed by the revelations of Snowden were a shock for certain businesses that thought even while China represented the biggest risk in terms of supervision.
A big change is producing itself in the data processing in cloud since the European people in charge became aware of the Fact that the preserved data to the United States are governed by virtue of the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation realized by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organism, some 10% of the non American members renounced their projects to use an American supplier of services of storage in the cloud after the revelations on the American program of exploration of the data Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-directeur of SAP, declares: "Our customers put us today a question that they put us not a year ago: where my data are preserved and you can guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?".
Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, to knowledge that the powerful states want to fly their secrets more precious and than these data have consequently to be kept to any price.
It is not surprising that there is economical spying.
It there in always had.
"This is a recurrent subject since many years and nothing not basically changed in the framework of the current discussion", declares Kurt Beer glass, general director of the productive corporation of chemical products BASF.
The Americans we spy on the commercial and industrial plan we spy them, for it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The business leaders are generally not very inclined to reveal the measures of prevention that they set up, in case that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
The big corporations hammer since a long time the message according to which it is for the less careless one to recover a key USB free at the time of a professional parlor or to leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Audi, declares that the collection of the portable telephones before the meetings of the counsel, so that they cannot be used as devices of listen from afar, is a current practice since years.
The BfV of Germany counsels to its leaders to envision to use simple portable telephones prepaid at the time of their trips abroad because of the risk of attain to the integrity of the smartphones.
The portable prepaid telephones next are thrown.
Nevertheless, one fears that the small and average businesses remain vulnerable to pirating and to the supervision.
In Germany, good number of SME are world-wide leaders in their special niche.
"The SMES lack often of the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect efficiently their industrial secrets against a non authorized access", warns the BfV in a report.
The United States warn their own corporations on the economical activities of spying realized by of other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (BORN) realized in February by the United States, quoted France, just like Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree to have carried out acts of pirating of economical pieces of information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a famous German corporation considered that when it is a matter of economical spying, "the French are the worse ones".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French internal piece of information, the DCRI, declared in a discussion this months: "The services perfectly know although all the countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against the terrorism, spy their allies."
A tax on the real estate owners foreigners to let the bubble of London burst

Mr. Cook declared: "After the increase of the right of stamp on the property of big value and the introduction of the anti-évitement law in the matter, it is very difficult in advance that the property of big value are under taxed regardless of the effects of the system of tax of obsolete dwelling."
"But this change could return the reluctant foreign investors to the idea to buy the property in London or the reluctant current owners to the idea to sell", it added.
The real estate one of prestige – the 5 to 10% of the prices the more students of the market of the real estate one – in the sector prospers situated to the southwest of London that stretches itself Fulham to Wimbledon, increased of a percentage record of 11.8% during the last year.
The prices in the center of London post an uniform growth of year in year of 5.6% but were eclipsed by an "internal market" rapidly expanding, the southwest of the city, the north (7,4%) and the east (6,5%) knowing a return, according to the studies of Savills.

A destined study to multiply the advantages of the rail project HS2 for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work realized by HS2 Ltd leaves to think that the services to big speed until Scotland and the north of England will start up as early as the opening of the Phase 1 in 2026.
The minister of the Transportations baroness Kramer declared that the project "would muster the United Kingdom".
The Scottish minister of the Transportations, Keith Brown was said "excited" to the idea to work with the British government on the project.
The Phase 1 will concern a new rail line to big speed between London and the West Midlands.
When the Phase 2 will be finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government reviewed to the increase the estimated cost of the construction of the liaison to big speed between London and the north of England, passing of 32.7 Md£to 42.6 Md£.
The British government, that is in talks with Transportation Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the reinforcement of the rail capacity and the improvement of the length of the trips for the north of England and Scotland.
That must include the possibility of lengths of trip between Glasgow and Edinburgh of three hours to the more.
The baroness Kramer declared: "Our objective for HS2 concerns a truly national network that will compare the United Kingdom and its cities."
We push the project HS2 for the advantages that it presents are huge.
Without him, we confronted to a problem of capacity of our rail network.
But it is a matter equally to develop the connectivity between the 18 big British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the liaisons between they are better thanks to HS2.
The British secretary of state for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "The today announcement is a good new one for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support "without ambiguity" the inclusion of the Scotland in the network HS2.
Mr. Brown declared: "The train to big speed has the potential one to offer considerable economical advantages to Scotland, but it brings equally the economical weight of the Scotland in the global project of rail network to big speed in the whole Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited to the idea to work in partnership with the British government in order to examine the options aiming to bring the train network to big speed up to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the line Glasgow Edinburgh that the Scottish government already is planning.
"I am impatient to read the examination report with the British ministers next years and we will decide then together next steps."
The UN greets the new objectives in favor of the fight against poverty
The United Nations will put themselves as early as at present to work on a new series of destined objectives to replace the objectives of the millennium for the development (OMD), that had been set up 12 years ago to fight against the poverty in the world.
The Australian diplomats played a role key in the placement forward of the "sustainable development objectives" destined to replace the OMD, that will expire in 2015, before the Summit of the United Nations on the sustainable development that began the day before to Rio of Janeiro.
They figured in the final draft of the document, that will be adopted by the world-wide leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The general secretary of the UN Drum roll ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time of "to surpass the national interests".
"I am happy that the States members accepted launching and to appropriate itself the aiming process to set up universal objectives of sustainable development (ODD)", it added.
These ODD s'appuieront itself on the realized progress in the framework of the objectives of the millennium for the development and will be an integral part the framework of development post-2015.
I will do the maximum to pay me the mandate that was entrusted me by the States members to realize our vision of the objectives of sustainable development that lean on the success of the OMD.
The parents of intersexual children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for the nourish born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The masculine or feminine sex the new born ones will not attributed anymore be them, in a rigid way, to the birth.
In the framework of the new law, the parents will not held anymore be to declare the sex of their child, the authorizing to register a sex "indeterminate" or "not specified" on his birth certificate.
The goal of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of the parents that could take precipitated decisions concerning a surgery of sexual réassignation for their nourrisson, and to fight against the discrimination in opposition to the intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, "I am or a man or a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that created the doctors, bruised and slashed.
One considers that a child on 2 000 born each year, is not or a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality being part of the group of the about sixty of diagnosed diseases as disorders of the sexual development, a generic term designating the people possessing of the chromosomes or gonads (ovaires or testicules) atypical or sexual abnormally developed organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexual.
The sexual identification not yet well is not understood, but most of the specialists to the said United States that when the sex cannot be determined, it is more better to use the better available information to attribute it, then to await and follow the psychological and physical development the child before envisioning a surgical act, if need be.
The Dr Jack Drescher, psychiatrist to New York and specialist of the questions of sexual identification, declared that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
The intersexual children put an ethical dilemma.
"Certain people suffer from diseases extremely engrave that necessitate a surgical act, but this is not the case of most of the children", it added.
It is possible to do a sexual summons without operation, and to see how the identity develops.
The science that consists of knowledge how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can reply to the knowledge question why that produces itself.
It is as the mystery that surrounds the homosexual people.
A report subject to the European Commission in 2011 described the intersexual people as different of the people transsexuelles or transgenres, since their statute is not linked to the sex but rather to their biological constitution, that is or exclusively the one of a man or exclusively the one of a woman, but is usually the two at the same time and not clearly defined as being the an or the other.
These characteristics can show themselves of themselves in the secondary sexual characters, (as the muscular mass, hairiness, the chest and the stature), the primary sexual characters (as the breeding organs and the sexual organs) or the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones.
The report gave equally a summary of discrimination to which were confronted the intersexual people and transgenres regarding job, as well as the extent of the acts of harassment and of violence and motivated crimes by prejudices.
The young boys of non conforming kind have henceforth camps that specially are destined them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize the adults to register masculine, feminine sex or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, an Australian one of 52 years, Norrie may-welby, became the first person to the world to have been recognized "neuter" after winning his process in call that the authorizes to keep a sex "not specified" to life.
The German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersexual, according to the ministry of the Interior.
In France neighbors, the kind questions always do the object of controversies, according to a broadcast report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators of this importantly Catholic country signed a petition for that the "theory of the kinds" is withdrawn school books.
The American site Catholic Online equally opposed itself to the German law, writing that "since the world is led in a new reign where the kind is a choice but where the sexual activity not some is a, one reverses two other pillars of the civilization."
In the Maryland, the mother of a nourrisson equally declared on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex is attributed to the babies to their birth.
"The parent role is sufficiently upsetting without additional restrictions, in particular if you do not know the sex of your child", she declared on the site intend for the young parents.
The children need stability and of certainties.
Historically, the born children without masculine sexual organs or feminine were called hermaphroditic, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god that had a double sex.
And scarcely about ten years ago, the medical community considered the kind as a slate-gray one, that one can obliterate and on which one can redessiner.
But henceforth, numerous are those that question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can be mistaken, knowing not how a child will feel his sexual réassignation when it will grow.
"In the middle of XXe century, one called that a psychiatric urgency", indicated Drescher.
When these children were born, one did not call the psychiatrist, one telephoned the surgeon.
The dominating theory on the manner to treat the provided children of ambiguous sexual organs was launched by the Dr John Money, university johns-hopkins, that considered that the kind is malléable.
It consecrated the term "sexual identity" and supported that the social and environmental signals – the manner of which the high parents a child – interact with the genes and the hormones of a child to fashion it so that it is identified as being masculine or sex feminine.
But in a case of 1966, known under the name of "John/Joan", its theories gave place to controversies.
It had counseled to the parents of a small boy of which the pénis had been cut at the time of a rushed circumcision to do it to castrate completely, while removing him equally the testicules, and to raise it as a girl.
"Money presented that as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case", declared Drescher.
At the age of about 15 years, it is returned to normalcy a boy and got married with a woman.
But to 38 years, it committed suicide.
Drescher declared that certain doctors "always repeat this model".
But in the years 1990, with the arrival of Internet, those that survived these operations of change of said sexes "[qu '] they are not satisfied result".
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a writer of 36 years of the Montana, that was born with male chromosomes XY but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors really could not say if it had a wide clitoris or a small pénis and were convinced that it could never have a "satisfactory life" as man.
Therefore little time after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicules and student as a girl.
One did him to take feminine hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I was not a girl", it declared on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
To 18 years, it underwent a vaginoplastie.
But depressing and going counts that something did not go, it asked his medical file.
Which it discovered horrified it.
I was sterilized to the birth – and no one had never said it for me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of the sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body to produce sufficiently testosterone for that its sexual organs can develop.
After learning the truth, it is returned to normalcy a man, while following a treatment to the testosterone and did itself to remove the breasts.
Surgery rendered sterile it.
Today, it defends the cause of the others in an organization called Interface Project, that tries to normalize the perception of the intersexual people.
But Anne tamar-mattis, general director of the organization to non lucrative based goal in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law "invites to the labeling and to the stigmatization".
"Many activists worry that the German law encourages the parents to take quick decisions and give to their child a sex" indeterminate"", she declared.
We are afraid that she encourages the interventions.
We think that it would be more better to attribute a masculine or feminine sex and await.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, therefore we can only to advance hypotheses.
Tamar-mattis declared that his organization supported the Australian law for "she authorizes the adults to choose to be recognized under third name sex".
"The adults should be able to take their own decisions about a legal kind", she added.
The German law concerns the granting of the sex to the birth.
This is not a battle that the young children should take to this age.
When they will grow, they will be able to take decisions concerning their own body.
But the Dr Arlene Baratz, specialized radiologue in the mammographies to Pittsburgh, of which the girl is suffering from a disorder of the sexual development and that helps thousands of people in a support group, declared that the German law "responsabilisera" the parents and the children.
The girl of the Dr Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called insensitivity syndrome completes to the androgenic ones.
Because of the failure of its receivers of androgenic, Katie developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or of ovaires.
Today 29 years old, Katie is gotten married and internal in infantile psychiatry to the university of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children by the mediated services of adoption or of mothers carriers.
"The law leaves a certain latitude to the parents for that they do not have to take hasty decisions", declared Baratz.
That leaves them the time to do certain tests and to understand them, and a delay before registering "masculine" or "feminine".
Thus, all is well – you can raise your child and to like it.
You have a magnificent baby and take advantage of the pleasure to be similar.
You do not have to precipitate you for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.

The cry of despair of a voter of Obama
I voted two times for the president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
It says that Obama did the praiseworthy efforts frustrated by the filibustering of the Republican Party
Filibustering does not excuse the difficulties of the site Obamacare, or the attacks of drones
The memory of the country 2008 of Obama is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in 2E medicine year to the Faculty of medicine of Harvard.
I am reading a horribly sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2E year of medicine and would give again me hope.
It is called "The Audacity à Win" and it is a matter of the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients evenings and that I go to bed, this book takes back me to the era where the political ones inspired millions of people and where the speeches could cut you the breath.
The election finished by a victory crushing and the presenters of the current newspapers took the time to reflect to the historic nature of the moment.
My friends cried joy and my parents preserved all the newspapers that they found.
A young team of visionary ones advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for the change.
During the transition period of Obama before his taken one of function in 2008, it had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, this is as go out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days a lot of optimism, are as of distant ones remember, a sad reminder of the timeliness of the passed.
The change really produced itself in the years that followed the first time where I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put to the credit of Obama of big realizations, since the passage of the Affordable For Act (law on the reasonable cares) to the departure of Iraq of our army, while going through the end of the "or seen done or know" and the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.
Of more, I believe that filibustering supporter destroyed too numerous efforts aiming to let our nation advance in the domain of the reformations of the immigration, public health care and closing of Guantanamo, among others things.
But after having many defended times the administration of Obama facing my peers and my colleagues, I no longer arrive to furnish explanations.
I am by political despair.
The republican obstruction cannot explain the placement on listens foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on private life of the Americans, done or put it in accusation of the denunciatory ones that reveal the ravages of the government.
She cannot justify the assassination of Anwar Al awlaki, an American citizen, without process, or the escape of the public financings and the passing of the authorized expenditures during the presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to the silence are the "more aggressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility to conceive a simple site Internet during more than three years after the law on the Affordable For Act was ratified.
I do not know if it is this to what I expected.
If, to 18 years, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political countries that the precede.
Evidently, the electoral function is not predictable, for the political party of opposition and the events that produce themselves by chance, as the slaughter of Newton, influence our public conversation.
Nevertheless, all the examples that I indexed above seem be largely the choice of the administration.
This is what disturbs me the more.
I have again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was filled with enthusiasm by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented an alternate confused one and not very refined that did not seem to allow determining its political or its positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate while being liberated pressure of future elections, would hold the promises of which one heard to speak since so a long time.
Nevertheless, while the index of favorable opinions has dived under the 45% this week, it is even more difficult to come back to the year 2008 through this book.
It does me to desire the numerous promises that flew away themselves.
This week, I read the party of the book that describes how Obama underwent huge losses to the profit of Clinton to the Primary ones of Pennsylvania.
At the time of a meeting according to country, it said to his team that it was necessary that they put back themselves on the good way and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want that we ourselves recentrions on our talent", it declared.
We must remember that are ourselves.
We here 5 years after, Mr. the President, and I no longer am agreed with you.
The points of expressed view in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
The New Star succeeded a return in force, side audiences, with 1.3 millions of viewers behind their post of TV, is 5.6% of party of audience.
But was the spectacle at the appointment?
Some 10 000 candidates presented themselves to the hearing of this 10E season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the mean Sinclair, perched it André Manoukian and Low Olive Tree.
On Twitter, the viewers divided their commentaries.
Passed the excitement to rediscover their favorite program, a lot were disappointed.
But why so many disappointment?
No candidate seems actually to have marked at the time of this first premium.
As each year, the first transmissions of hearing toss a wide choice of singers in grass, for the better one and sometimes for the worse one.
Now, on Twitter, one wants spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some a there found their account.
They are numerous to have attempted the New Star, and sometimes even to have gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of singer to success always are there, season after season.
Of others have just the ambition to do to laugh.

The new concerning these investigations shook the traders in a sector that was the one of the biggest motors of growth of the unities of trading of the banks of investment during the last years, but that was questioned this year because of the weak volatility of the mottos that limit the timeliness for the speculators.
Certain bankers tried to minimize the matter while saying that it is almost impossible to handle the vast market of the change strongly liquidates, but the senior traders explain that that is not necessarily true.
A senior trader declared that in spite of the high volume of the transactions of daily change, the fragmentation of the liquidity between the platforms of management of the exchanges and the usage more and more frequents by the banks of their clean internal platforms "explains than it is possible to begin having an impact on the market to few expense".
The new one arrived the day same where the Swiss Credit announced to have sent back a working trader in his office of the negotiated funds the stock Market of London this week after it caused a loss of 6 M$ in end of last year.
The bank quickly informed competent authorities and cooperated with the regulating ones.
"We convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was mastered", indicated a representative of the Swiss Credit.

The homage to the folk of the brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" brothers Coen, Grand Prix of the last Festival of Canes, is a nostalgic and funny film the Greenwich town of 1961 and the music folk that began all just one to there to resound, before the arrival of Bobsled Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, of which the filmography has just been the object of a retrospective one to the Cinematic Frenchwoman, had swiped the Palm of now to Canes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of to be able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their reserved one on the star climbing of the American movie, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the pop planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this stuffed film of humor where the music is a central personage and the live interpreted songs, Oscar Isaac reveals itself a musician and singer of accomplished folk, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop one for the music folk with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich finery of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the magnificent one" for less gleaming clothing, a soft voice when she sings, but the debited swearword to the submachine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" relates on a week the hardships of a singer of folk that does not arrive to pierce and gets angry with the entire earth.
It accepts to back up the replacements to the raised foot in the studios.
Without lodging, it does the turn of the couches of its friends that want well again to receive it.
A documentary air

If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two film directors fans of music folk built their history on of true personalities of the era as the musician folk Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich town, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the leap of the music folk that would generate international stars" as the manuscript the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film takes then paces of documentary, label of dusty music invaded of 33T unsold lived by an old secretary impayable, to the musical choices of the studios of the era and to coffees where produced themselves the singers.
The magic of the brothers Coen operates again while integrating a funny one of personage that crosses the film in permanence: a magnificent reddish cat to the cracking look, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Questioned on the manner of which it composed his personage, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled to have "grown in the Tennessee, bathed by the blues and the country".
"My first lesson of music were given me by my grandfather that learned me to play the guitar", it had added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary for "to be considered as voucher", "the chance also can launch the career of someone", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis that refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important one it is of not to leave itself to jam by all that can prevent us from express us".

Spying of the NSA: the United States are "gone too far", admits Kerry
The United States sometimes went "too far" regarding spying, recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in the middle of the debate with Europe on the massive collection of given ones by the national Agency of security (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, of revelations and of denial between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American governmental person in charge explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and of data in Europe.
"In certain cases, I grant it to you, as did it the president, certain of these actions went too far and we will assure ourselves that that no longer arrives in the future", declared John Kerry at the time of a lecture to London to which it participated since Washington Thursday October 31 by video liaison.
In his broadcast intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the boss of the American diplomacy at length justified the practices of pieces of information and of collection of information by the necessary anti-terrorist fight and the prevention against of eventual attempts.
Invoking the September 11 attempts 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and the one of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that American authorities had since frustrated many projects of attempts, thanks to the interception of communications and the information collection.
"We have prevented fact that of the airplanes do not fall, that of the buildings explode and only of the people are murdered, because we were in a position to know in upstream of these projects", argued the employer of the American diplomacy.
And, asserted John Kerry to the address of the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of the innocent people were not cheated".
But we strive to muster the news.
"And yes, in certain cases, this went too far in an inappropriate way", again admitted the Secretary of State, that already had to express itself on this international scandal at the time of a turn last week to Paris, London and Rome.
It assured Thursday evening that the president Obama was "resolved to attempt to clarify and that it proceeded to a réexamen of these practices so that no one feels cheated".
But the controversy between American and European continued to swell this week with of new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data of hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, that quotes obtained documents with the former consultant one NSA Edward Snowden, asserts that the baptized program "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data since the fibers views used by the internet giants.
To some to believe one of the documents, some 181 millions of elements had been collected during the only months of last January - going of métadonnées on e-mail, to elements of text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside of the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any link with these practices.
Since ten days, several big newspapers in France, in Germany, in Spain or in Italy, revealed that the NSA massively would have intercepted data and communications emanating allies of the United States and of their leaders, notably the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Facing the anger of European States and while escapes in the American press asserted that the American president was not during the course of such listen, Barack Obama refused to express itself to this subject, invoking the national security.
On the other hand, the employer of the powerful NSA, the general Keith Alexander, denied him that his piece of information agency obtained tens of millions of communications of European citizens.
It even sent back the bullet to the European services of piece of information that would have seized themselves of these communications, before to furnish them to the NSA.
That would concern of the "military operations" in countries where these allies of NATO cooperate with the United States and that would not aim absolutely Europe, asserted the general Alexander.
And the debate spread itself Friday to Asia.
The Indonesia summoned the ambassador of Australia, of which the mission is accused to be used by the Americans in the framework of a vast network of international spying that equally gave rise to the ire of China.
Precocious puberty: Age earlier
Studies show that the African-American girls and Hispanics tend to attain the age of the puberty earlier that the white girls.
The physical changes do not mean that the puberty is imminent
Nothing prove that the hormones or that of other chemical substances are responsible
The experts think that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger of the precocious puberty
The tendency towards a precocious puberty also is not pronounced with the boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialized journalist in the family questions and of health with the child.
A mother she must worry if the breasts and the pubic hairs of his girl begin pushing to 7 or 8 years?
At the time of the annual lecture of the American Academy of Pediatrics that was held this week to Orlando, in Florida, the Dr Paul Kaplowitz, pédo-endocrinologue, explained that these precocious physical changes are rather current among the young American one and represent a new norm.
"I pass a lot of times to reassure the parents – usually, that does not indicate a quick evolution towards the full puberty", declared Kaplowitz.
The evident signs of development, such as the burgeoning of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic zone and the bodily odors, appear earlier with the girls.
But there was only a light one advanced age of the first rules during the four last decades.
To the United States, the average age is of 12 years and half, while it was of 12 years three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest began developing, it is necessary at least two or three years before the first rules appear", indicated Kaplowitz, equally the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guides à Coping with This Common Problem".
The time is the test more precise for knowledge how will evolve the puberty.
There is a debate concerning which constitutes the real apparition of the puberty, but she is considered as "precocious" when the development of the chest is accompanied of a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most of the cases, the development slows down or stops itself – it is something that a paediatrician can follow by near.
A quicker evolution can justify the tests realized by an endocrinologist to separate from the problems engrave as tumors or cysts.
There exist the treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to warn other consequences: a premature ageing of the bones that can brake the growth and a small size to the adult age.
The regarding treatment medicinal and hormonal recommendations are based on the age of the child, the development rate, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are equally important.
Kaplowitz is prudent with the medicines but recognizes that "the fact to check the puberty can lessen certain problems of behavior and the sensation for the girls to be different of the others".
The other big problem is understandable: The parents want all simply step only their very girls have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the manner of which they will manage the hygiene questions", declared Kaplowitz.
"That was a shock", remembers a woman of which the girl had its first rules to 10 years.
Even if there were signs and that we had talked about the rules, she was not prepared emotionally.
She returned from the frightened and overturned school to be the first one among its girlfriends.
Numerous there exist theories reaches to the knowledge of the public on the causes of the precocious puberty.
Nevertheless, there is not any coherent theory according to which the contained hormones in the milk or of other foods, the present chemical products in the environment or the sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
The boys, as the girls, attain their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz asserts that the hypothesis more credible is the one of the epidemic of obesity.
It participated in a conducted study on girls of age 6 to 9 years that secures the percentage of fatty mass to the triggering of the puberty.
Of discovered others support this conclusion, but there exist other numerous influential factors.
In this country, the African-American girls and Hispanics tend to attain the age of the puberty earlier that the white girls.
It exists various explanations.
To the world-wide ladder, the mechanisms of the precocious puberty seem to be influenced by all, economical conditions to the climate, while going through the genes.
Other problem: Although the boys have hairs on the face and in the pubic zone younger, the tendency towards a true precocious puberty also is not pronounced as with the girls.
Of other doctors participating in the lecture of the AAP insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and pubic hairs is current, even with the nourish and the all small ones.
"We must be prudent as for the manner of which identify ourselves the true one appearance of the puberty", said the Dr Lawrence Silverman, a working pédo-endocrinologue to the hospital for children Goryeb to Morristown, in the New Jersey.
The parents should not hesitate to ask counsel to their paediatrician for knowledge how to speak with their child.
"That can want to say to have a conversation earlier that foreseen", explained Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will react well usually.
The girls of which the puberty is precocious must be reassured on the Fact that, even when that arrives earlier that foreseen, the process is part of life.

It says me "one is liberated", but I not some am sure, and is said me that one again can be killed.
One is very excited, but very stretched also.

The descent of the stairway of the airplane, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all that is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and at my place, many bikes follow our car that drive Roussin.
The motorcyclists pull themselves the stuffs to do the photos and follow me until at my place where I must do a little the police to prevent certain climb.
The media pressure is huge.
That does not stop, we well placed to know it...
But the state of emotion and of fatigue is such as it is difficult with there to see clear.
One goes out of a hole and one is all of a sudden under the media fires.
This a little is complicated, a not very violent, rather complex one to manage.
But one did the hardest one.
Evenings same, I am at the 20H, the next day also I am at the TV.
Begin next a sort of readaptation to life, very gently, during an or two months that are a little as vacation.
How did happen the medical examinations and the debriefing DGSE?
I had had right to a first medical check in Corsican.
The remainder was done to the Val-de-Grâce the days following my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist.
This is not a meeting that does all but one knows that one can count on him, to recall it if need, that one is not delivered to ourselves.
That is part of the procedure.
I also met the piece of information services.
They asked me questions on the takers of hostages.
It was logical.
That did not bother me.
How do you react, today, to the liberation of the four hostages of Niger?
I listen what is said.
The debate on the ransoms notably.
Certain things irritate me, of others less.
I try to do the party of the things between the questions on my passed as hostage and my cap of president of the association "Hostages of the world" that allows me to put distance, and seems me well more interesting to approach.
I wonder for example on the definition of the resiliency.
Especially, I fight, with of others, for the recognition of the lawful statute of the hostage.
There is according to me a problem of semantic one.
It is necessary to qualify the taken hostages of take of hostages "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to carry complaint and to bring their takers of hostages in front of the international penal Course.
Today, once more, everyone is in compassion, in the emotion, and rejoices at the liberation of these hostages.
But that says that these hostages maybe could have them also access to justice?
A court to The Hague is done for that.
Why would not say one to the takers of hostages "you scorned the rules of the war, as the one of all the Geneva conventions, one will bring you in justice"?
That seems me nevertheless founded, legitimate, hit with the common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and that is shocked me.
This is my principal fight.

The Wolf of Wall Street: gone out of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves to escape some pictures of his next film of which title role, the one of an ambitious New York broker, is incarnate by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and go out your bills.
Leonardo DiCaprio will mess the hair you in his role of wacky trader.
Martin Scorsese relates us the true history of a "broker in stock Market of Long Island, that refuses to collaborate with the authorities in the framework of a vast matter of corruption to Wall Street".
In the years 80, Jordan Belfort brings up then one swindles that will do him a rich, very rich man.
The occasion to follow his unbelievable ascension, but also the breathtaking fall that itself while following.
Without limits, the man links the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess in any kind are the masters words of this crazy history.
The couple scorsese-dicaprio seems to have rediscovered the magic that had them united in Shutter Island.
The go out of the new Scorsese took delay because of his too long mounting.
It would seem that the film lasts finally 2h45.
In room December 25, it will be able to participate accuracy to the race to the oscars.
The stock Market of London closed in lowers Thursday, sealed by the bad results of Shell and to the day following an announcement by the Fed of the maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as foreseen.
To The Seyne, the relogement for rat cause turns to the debate
At the start of the week, a family left his apartment in ground floor of the building Fructidor D2, because of the rat presence.
In front of the urgency of the position, the director of the office Earths of the South Habitat, proposed, in an exceptional way and provisional, to rehouse the couple and its three children in one T4 nine.
Nevertheless, the family refuses "for financial reason" and the position is blocked.
The matter took exaggerated proportions, estimates Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats, it there in always had in the cities.
The pest control business realizes two passages per year, and what's more, we intervene, to our load, to every request of the inhabitants.
We thus carried out, since the end of the last winter, 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to the abandonment, and the rats do not proliferate in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and of public health, the pest control products are four times less effective than by the passed, of course, but for two rats, one will not kill a childlike one.
"We did not invite the rats at our place", defends itself the family father that left his lodging to install itself to the hotel.
We are soon without the penny and we await a new lodging, to the same tariff that the old one.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create internally a structure of défaisance ("bad bank") grouping together 38 billions pounds (45 billion Euros) of active ones the done more risk, measures destined to relax its relations with London and to accelerate his reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce of 55% to 70% the proportion of the active doubtful one in his report in the two years to come and hopes to have cleaned completely this one in the three years.
RBS equally said that she would register a provision for depreciation of the additional doubtful credits of four to 4.5 billions pounds on the quarter, a writing linked to the constitution of the structure of stationing.
RBS specified as as this internal restructuring would liberate of 10 to 11 billions pounds of capital, reinforcing thus his capacity to lend.
The bank and London underlined that the "bad bank" would allow pulling a trait on the passed, the government having in particular been accused to interfere in the management of RBS.
"We now can forge ahead, we to worry about the future and of the 90% of the active ones that constitute a bank really good and construct a big bank for the clientele and for the United Kingdom", said the new general director beat up McEwan to the press.
George Kerevan: The explosion of Europe gives the choice to the Scots
Another day, another disturbing history of independence.
This time, one warns us that an independent Scotland would be held to rejoin the European zone of free circulation to be able to adhere to THE E.U.
And here that one hears histories of check of the passports to Berwick and of a border of barbed sons alongside the wall of Hadrien.
If it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde indicated the eventual fallen again one economical of a bigger liberty of circulation with the remainder of Europe, that did not figure nevertheless in the headlines (and it was to foresee).
Not person did more say only the States members of THE E.U. consecrate a big party of their time to bypass their definite rules when that arranges them.
Since not done left Scotland of the space Schengen for the moment, a continuous non-respect of the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in compensation of all that she wants to obtain from the Scots.
It is a matter therefore of a history that not some is a.
And a so old history that she now is immobilized: I heard for the first time the fib according to which "the independence means the check of the passports" more than 40 years ago.
Nevertheless, one forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty story.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why the yoke of London to exchange against the one of Brussels, in particular now?
Here the true concerning current event Europe: the big plan according to aiming war to unify Europe is definitively to the dead point.
With the crisis of the Euro, the Project Europe is officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties that oppose themselves to THE E.U. or that campaign for the abandonment of the Euro as common motto, win land.
Even in Germany, the Alternate euro-skeptic party for Germany, been founded only this year and arrived from no one leaves, mustered almost five millions of voices at the time of the federal elections of September and has gone out the liberal Party democrat (equivalent of our liberal democrats) Bundestag.
It there always had a national opposition to the project of creation of a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economical crisis marked a turn.
The austerity taxed by Berlin and the European central Bank, associated with weighing rigidity on the economies national by the intermediary one adhesion to the uniform currency, drove many people to think that the Project Europe went too far.
The crisis of the Euro does not have big thing to see with the national governments that record excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.
The European system rather did to weigh on its members of the rates of change in favor of the exporting Germans – which the German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national motto, the countries of Europe of the south meet again with a problem of intrinsic productivity with respect to Germany.
The only recourse is to do the dark cuttings in the salaries and the public expenditures – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the budget and current monetary problems it exists a deeper malaise linked to the productivity in Europe.
After the political energetic one "green" taxed by Brussels – that are a reason to subsidize the French and German corporations of the sector of the energy to the expenses of the consumer – the European industry pays two times more for the electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.
It is a matter of an inconvenience rédhibitoire in terms of costs, as we already saw it to Grangemouth.
All the freezes of salaries to the world will not prevent the industry pétrochimique European to be penalized by a shale inexpensive American gas.
Consequently, the revolt scolds, in particular in France, the one of the big leaders of THE E.U.
After the war, the French political elite considered THE E.U. as a means to check Germany and to put Paris on an equality foot with Washington.
But Berlin no longer has need of Paris as passport of his political legitimacy and imposed his own economical politics in Europe, leaving the French economy put to poorly to struggle itself.
Result: the party of extreme right of Navy The Pen, the anti-european National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending back the socialists in power at the third place.
The National Front henceforth left it the most popular one in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labor Party that recalls him than it cannot leave the principle than a split of the right will favor automatically the left.
What does Marine The Pen with his new popularity with the class worker French white?
She wants to use the European elections of next year to create a unique anti-change pad and anti-european within the European Parliament.
If the anti-european parties do good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a pad could check the European Parliament for the first time.
Here which I think: very soon, the anti-european feeling and unique anti-change in Europe will unify itself and will end up to kill the Euro.
THE E.U. will not disappear, but she will come back to something that will resemble more to "Europe of the Nations (sovereign)" free privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and someone of its economies satellites could preserve the Euro, but France and Europe of the rediscover souths their own motto.
I expect that the United Kingdom takes its distances in comparison with this project, and I hope that it will do the soft eyes to the United States.
Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington for the Pacific leaves to think that the Great Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all that?
We can decide to be a region of the small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economical interests, which includes to send to take a walk Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could suit itself of an European agreement freer provided that we kept our own motto.
The cooperation with the other countries to the similar views would be easier in an Europe of the non federal Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate the Norway and preserve our economical independence.
The government SNP of Scotland is – and it is to be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that it more better succeeded in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 base on his opposition to the dark proposed cuttings (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labor chessboard, Alistair Darling, and the conservative coalitions/liberal-democrats that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for the Scotland to vote for the independence if this is to accept the austerity taxed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house the prey of the flames in the Old Quebec
A fire that released itself Friday noon in the Old Quebec quickly was mastered.
More of about thirty firemen were dispatched to the 9 of the street Hébert.
The flames declared themselves in a house of three lodgings divide up on four situated floors behind the course of the Seminary of Quebec.
All the tenants were absent at the time of the fire.
The fire was mastered an hour after the arrival of the firemen, that were numerous to intervene.
Immediately that our first firemen arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.

An investigation is in course to find the cause of this fire.
Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota

Fine of service for the boss cook of the Elysée
Enter into the 500 m2 kitchens élyséennes as clerk after working in embassies, the cook ascended all the rungs until to become boss, nine years ago.
It served six French presidents, of Georges Pompidou to François Holland while going through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and nourished a number countless of big ones of this world in an almost anonymity that it breaks only today, on time retirement, to 60 years.
The man to the face open, emptied skull and glasses of intellectual, been born October 24 1953 to the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is tenured of a CAPE of pastry.
His mother was range itself in a castle of Sologne.
"I am passed of a castle the other!", is ironic Bernard Vaussion, that knows not only the mania of the six presidents for which it has officié, but also of their spouses and of certain ones of their illustrate invited.
"It always is the boss of the State or his companion or marries that chooses the menus", it recalls.
"Mrs Chirac a little was more implied, she came directly in kitchen", to the point that she had forbidden the women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Not in déplaise to bosses of State that posted a relative indifference to the earthly foods, "they are all gluttons", denounces kindly Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had of course "an appetite a little more developed".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, that had eliminated cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Holland, that reestablished cheese, "it is someone that likes to eat" and "there is not big thing that it does not like".
The current boss of the State, that regained the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, does not have "any request of specific system".
Bernard Vaussion remembers also pressure that weighed on its shoulders, in particular at the time of the dinners of State to the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in an hour about".
The night that precedes is practically white.
Those people would not understand that there are errors.
The henceforth former boss of the kitchens of the Elysée, that took a glass Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pincement to the heart". François Holland came to greet me".
It said praises.
"His human side went out again", it relates.
The boss will be replaced by his assistant one, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years, that is for its part for seventeen years to the Elysée.

The investigation on the mayor Rob Ford was rushed, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed to have put the hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking of the ace, Me Clayton Ruby supported never to have seen an investigation "so rushed".
Me Ruby said to believe The Canadian Press that the police had "unknown or minimized" the proof elements against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police stopped the friend and occasional driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused it extortion comparatively to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused illegal dealings in drugs, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said also to have observed this delivering man of the packages to Rob Ford, indicate again documents of course.
Me Ruby qualified of" inexplicable" the Fact that the police never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his residence, or put on listens his telephone, supporting that the boss of police Bill Blair chose with full knowledge of the facts of not to act against the mayor.
By virtue of the law, the police, having been witness of suspicious transactions in hands own, very well could have intercepted the vehicle of Rob Ford, stop the mayor, and carry out a search - even without mandate.
She could equally have required an instantaneous search warrant, if necessary judged.
The police boss did not comment on, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash qualified the comments of Me Ruby of "evident and hopeless attempt" to emphasize itself with the media in a matter that does not concern it not in the least.
In press conference, Thursday, Mr. Blair asserted that it did not have anything in this video that can constitute of the "reasonable motives" being able to take to the criminal deposit of an accusation against the mayor.

Explosion of a house to Gesves: a defective water-heater to the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette at the time of a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling to Gesves, that did two injureds engrave Friday morning, a grandmother of 52 years and his grandson of 5 years, is had to an originating gas leak of a defective water-heater, indicated Friday evening the substitute of the prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched on the spot by the floor assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was an escape and a gas accumulation.
The vital prediction of the two victims always is engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and seriously is burned.
The small boy, that stayed with his grandfather and his companion, was at its sides and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubées and at length conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Cork, she in helicopter, him in ambulance", specified the burgomaster José Paulet, descended on the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was at the floor at the explosion.
Healthy and safe, it was able to rejoin the ground floor by the intact remained stairway while the rear wall of the house totally was destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house neighbors, weakened by the explosion, were rehoused by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and of Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée stabilized the two buildings.
A black can in your car?
While the planificateurs of the road network of the United States have trouble to find necessary money to repair infrastructure autoroutière in decrepitude, numerous are those that glimpse a solution in the form of an a small black can that sets up itself above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, that record all the miles traversed by a motorist and transmit the news to the officials, are at the controversial center of an attempt to Washington and in the governmental offices of the planning to modify the obsolete system of financing of the principal American roads.
The sector generally without interest of the planning of the main roads has sudden provoked a strong animated debate and eventful alliances.
The libertarians rejoined groups ecologists to do pressure so that the government uses the small cans to keep the track of the miles that you traverse, and eventually road on which circulate you, then to use the news to compose a project of fiscal law.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The Civil American Liberties Union is she also very preoccupied and expresss his worry concerning the protection of private life.
And while the members of the Congress do not arrive to come to an agreement for knowledge if it is necessary to continue, several States did not await.
They look for how, during the next decade, they will be able to pass to an allowing system to the drivers to pay according to the number of traversed miles.
Thousands of motorists already embarked these black cans, sometimes equipped of a system of supervision by GPS, for a turned experimental one.
That is really essential for our nation.
"This is not as if we had the choice", declared Hasan Ikhrata, general director of the Southern California Association of Governments, that foresees that the State begins recording the miles traversed by every Californian motorist of here 2025.
There will be change in the manner of which pay us these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes on account of the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the pump, is financially to dry.
The Americans no longer buy as much of gasoline than before.
The cars can traverse more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, that is of 18.4 hundred a gallon, did not increase for 20 years.
The politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even of 1 hundred, while the prices of the gasoline students.
"The tax on the gasoline is not all simply step tenable", declared The Munnich, a specialist of politics of transportations to the university of the Minnesota.
His State recently did to install traceurs on 500 cars to test a payment system to the mile.
"That proves itself to be the alternate one the more logic in the long term", it said.
Wonks calls that of the expenses of usage to the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the liberal city-dwellers, since the taxes could serve to modify the driving habits so as to allow reducing the obstructions and the gas transmissions, for example.
The planificateurs of California are very interested in the system since they elaborate strategies to attain the fixed objectives in the ambitious laws of the State on the climatic warming.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), president of the Committee of the transportations of the House of Representatives, declared that it considered it also as the alternate one the more viable in the long term.
The favoring market free one foundation Reason appreciate equally the idea to let the drivers pay to the mile.
"It is not a matter not simply of a tax rushing in a big black hole", declared Adrian Moore, vice president of the political one to foundation Reason.
The people pay more directly for the advantages that are obtained them.
The movement is equally supported by two American former secretaries to the Transportations that, in a report of 2011, urged the Congress to go in the way of the payment to the mile.
The American Senate approved a project pilots of 90 M$ last year that would have concerned about 10 000 cars.
But the presidency of the Room killed the suggestion, replying to the preoccupations of the rural legislators representing voters that must traverse many miles everyday to go to their work or in city.
Several States and big cities do nevertheless of the progress of their side.
The done more determine is the Oregon, that mobilized 5 000 drivers to take the experience more important of the country.
These motorists will pay soon to the State of the fresh kilométriques instead of the taxes on the gasoline.
The Nevada already took to term a project pilots.
The city of New York in envisions one.
The stretched Illinois an essay on a limited number of trucks.
And the coalition I-95, that understands 17 implied agencies in the road transportation in States following the coast is American (understanding the Maryland, the Pennsylvania, the Virginia and the Florida) student how she could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In the Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists recently equipped their car of a device, the drivers were worried that the government can follow their least facts and gestures.
"The worries on the subject of Big Brother and this thing kind are a big problem", declared Alauddin Khan, that directs the strategic management of the performance to the department of the Transportations of the Nevada.
This is not something that the people want.
As early as the beginning of the essay, the ACLU of the Nevada warned on his site: "This would be comparatively easy to transform these devices in location devices to entire party."
It is not necessary to construct a huge technological infrastructure and cluttering that inevitably will be widened to preserve the recordings of the avenues and daily comings of the people.
The Nevada is part of the some States that struggle themselves henceforth to find a reasonable technology that would allow the knowledge State how much miles traverses a car, but without knowing the place or the exact hours.
If one can do that, added Khan, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology brought certain agencies of State to call upon a small start-up of California of the name of True Mileage.
To the origin, the corporation did not destine itself to help the motorists that pay taxes to the States.
She tried to pierce in the emerging market of the car assurance, in which the drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that she tests pleased the planificateurs of the main roads for they do not use the GPS and furnish a limited quantity of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"The people will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not localize them", declared Ryan Morrison, general director of True Mileage.
Of big errors were committed in the programs pilot certain States.
There exist the well means less costly and well methods less intrusive to proceed.
In the Oregon, the planificateurs attempt the experience while offering to the different motorists choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They again can choose of not to have device of the all, preferring to the place to pay a based fixed price on the average number of miles traversed by all the residents of the State.
Of other States hope to sell the concept to distrusting citizens while allowing the devices of some to do more, rather than not enough.
In the city of New York, the people in charge of the transportations try develop a taxation device that would equally be equipped to pay the parking expenses, to furnish an assurance "payment to driving" and to create a data body on the speed in real time in origin of the conducting others that the motorists could use to avoid the traffic jams.
"The motorists would be incited to participate because of the advantages that the system offers them", indicated a document on the urban installation.
Nevertheless, certain planificateurs of the transportations wonder if the whole debate on the payment to the mile is not simply a huge diversion.
To the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the zone of the bay of San Francisco, the said people in charge that the Congress very simply could manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund while increasing the taxes on the gasoline.
A unique or additional annual tax on the vehicle drivers cross and on of others of which the vehicles do not consume a lot of gasolines, so that each pay his just one leaves.
"It is not necessary to resort to to a radical surgery when one has all simply need of aspirin", declared Randy Rentschler, the director of the legislation and public matters with the commission.
If one does that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the private protection of their life and of a pile of something else.
The British police delivers an extradition mandate in opposition to Assange
The British police today delivered an extradition mandate in opposition to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, that is itself refugee to the Embassy of the Ecuador to London and asked the political refuge.
Scotland Yard declared that she had delivered a "discount opinion" in opposition to the Australian of 40 years, asking him to present itself to a police commissionership, adding that if it did not do it, it would be likely to be stopped.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden after the allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all the possible ways by virtue of the British law after the supreme Court invalidated the call that it lodged against his extradition at first of the months.
Fearing that Stockholm authorizes his transfer towards the United States, it found refuge to the Embassy of the Ecuador to London June 19, asking this country of South America the political refuge.
Scotland Yard has "delivered an opinion of discount in opposition to a man of 40 years that asks him to present itself to a police commissionership, to the date and the hour of his choice", declared a spokesperson.
It continues to infringe the conditions of his placement in liberty under guarantee.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the opinion by the police.
Assange is afraid of to be extradited from the Sweden towards the United States where it could be accused spying, after unveiling more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables on the site WikiLeaks fighting against secret the news.
Entrusted Letta in the longevity of his government
The president of the Italian Counsel Enrico Letta judges that his held government up to 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and upright within the coalition in power at the approach the vote of the Senate to strip of Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview to the Newspaper The Stampa, the said left center leader to have "firmly the intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015.
The high room of the Italian parliament will meet in the current of the months to decide of the go out of the former president of the condemned Counsel for fiscal fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw its support for the government if the Senate, where it counts more opponents than of supporters, pronounces his discharge.
But a part of his camp, grouped together around the national secretary of the People of liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as showed it October 2 last his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi that already wished to let the office fall.
Since more of a year, everywhere, I am in a position to to note a strong discontent from the people that I meet: monstrous reappraisal of their property, tax flood, cost of the permits of all sorts, administrative fresh to do not what's more to finish.
Brief, siphonage without limit of our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow an a lot respectful taxation of those that pay.
Any removed money of forces to the taxpayers diminishes their consumer liberty and contributes to their impoverishment.
To Shawinigan, despite the major closing of all the businesses, one does not bother oneself as for the expenditures somptuaires and to the discussion of the lame ducks: loss-making cultural center, strong subsidy to the City of the Energy, etc.
If these installations are not profitable, that one sells them to the private business or that one demolishes them.
It is distressing also to note the expropriation of several property in order to welcome a major industry that never came.
Do I give nevertheless an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso in a sort of industrial incubator, but to which cost for the tax payers?
This is not at the public bearings to invest in of such businesses, but well to the private sector while basing itself on the request of the consumer.
The citizens were happy to to learn that the lakes to the Fishing and Batteries will continue to supply the city in drinkable water.
Following the departure of all the industries (big consumers of water) and to the big decline of the population, the usage of water considerably diminished everywhere on the territory.
Without wanting to say to waste it, the city will never lack water and the harsh regulation as for his usage big could be softened.
In summary, it is well easy to realize big things with the money of the others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a report.
With a debt brute of more than 200 million $, this city is not even more able to buy a pen without going through a loan regulation.
We managed since more than 40 years by collared with of beautiful diplomas mostly and I believe not than a breeder of sheep fact worse.
A worker dies buried under pads of concrete
A worker of the construction is dead buried under tens of pads of concrete, Thursday morning, to Montreal.
The drama is arisen around 11 o'clock, on the street Inlays, very close to the intersection of the street Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont It Small Fatherland.
According to any likelihood, carried out works on foundations unfolded themselves to this place since a certain time.
A wall of joint foundation had just been erected during the last days.
The accident produced itself the moment the victim had just arrived on the work-site in order to recover its tools.
I passed by car and I saw the wall to collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain John, that remains nearby of the work-site.
I am landed and I went to remove the big bricks that recovered it.
One saw only a part of his back, this is so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the fifty that worked for a form business.
Maneuvers of intensive care were attempted by the urgency services, but unsuccessfully.
The man did not survive its engrave injuries.
An inspector of the Commission of health and security of the work was dispatched on the places in order to investigate on the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The NSA questions an "internal error" and not of the computer pirates for the breakdown of his site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow declared Friday that it was a bug that had caused the public breakdown of his site during some hours, and not of the hackers as certain had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible during some hours tonight because of an internal error that took place during an updated foreseen", indicated the spying agency in a declaration by email.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The allegations according to which ones the breakdown was had to an attack of denial of distributed service [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, the trackers of online waiters noted that the site of the NSA had been broken down during at least 6 hours, and certain users not yet cannot attain the site.
Earlier, a spokesperson of the NSA indicated to ABC New that the sensitive internal network of the agency not at all was "" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesperson.
At least a group of online hacktivistes claimed to be responsible of the breakdown of the site of the NSA by an attack DSD.
The attacks DSD aim to flood a targeted site until the waiters are overloaded and that the site collapses.
The cyber-tactique is not very artificial and the attacks are not destined to penetrate in the internal network of the aimed system.
The formerly secret extremist NSA, a nicknamed time the "No Such Agency", met again under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized during the last months after a revelation wave about its vast programs of supervision of the communications at the national level and abroad – that are part of the secret files of the stolen NSAS to the agency and divulged by the old consultant one cynical of The NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency provoked a lot of speculations according to which ones the tonight incident was the targeted result of a cyber-opération.
The Delta Centers now closed City
The hotel Delta Centers City closed its doors Thursday to Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment funds that possessed the structure sold it to promoters that will transform it in studying residences.
Three hundred fifty people worked to the hotel.
Among them, 200 did not not yet find new job.
Delta promises of not to drop its employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, one individually met the employees to evaluate their needs.
"That support will continue for the six next months", explains the regional director of the relations of work of the Hotels Delta, Félix Bisson.
The closing of the Delta intervenes in a hotel very competitive market.
The investment funds that was owner of this builds there had choices to do.
Is it réinvestissait in the builds to continue to operate it, therefore there were investments of tens of million while the competition is very ferocious, there is a lot of new hotels that appeared to Montreal.
"Or is it sold it to someone of other and this happened", explains Paul Arsenault, tenured of the Pulpit of tourism Chair to the School of the sciences of the management of the UQAM.
Of other hotels of Montreal also will be converted in the next months, as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for elderly people.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling close to 600 rooms will see the light of day two years from now.
Do you want an ice fluo?
A British contractor created the first fluorescent ice to the world to jellyfish basis.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent property of this sea animal to develop a luminescent light meal.
It in had the idea after reading a study on the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate chemically the brilliant protein.
The frozen cream reacts with the language while increasing the pH of the protein to do it to shine.
Chris explains that, since the frozen cream begins shining when she reacts to the heat of the mouth, more one licks, more she becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the corporation of ices "Lick Me I'm Delicious", declared: "This is something unbelievable but we are some again only to the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200£."
The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the language to neuter pH.
Therefore when your mouth reheats the protein, the level of pH increases and the ice begins shining.
We have it tested during the last months and it seemed timely to divide it with all at Halloween for she gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the ice more dear than I created for the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four dearer time than gold.
Every ball costs me therefore about 140£.
But she has rather good taste!
The corporation to the experimental gait of Charlie, based to Bristol, is known for its perfumes of unusual ice such as beer, cheese, beef and the leaf of now.
But his next creation announces itself even more ambitious.
It added: "I would want really to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that constitute the frozen cream, but I think that I will find a means of there to arrive.
The ice uses the fluorescent property of the synthesized jellyfish by Chinese scientists.
An injured engraves in an accident with a driver ghost on the ring of Brussels
An accident of the road did an injured engraves, Friday morning towards 5h30, on the internal ring of Brussels to height of Hoeilaart, heading for Waterloo.
The car of a driver was hit by a driver ghost, that is him undamaged.
The ring was closed to the circulation, to 9h00, to the place of the accident, the time that the road is cleared and that an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This position did not nevertheless do hardly provoke traffic jams for the accident took place at height of the exit Hoeilaart.
The circulation from that time could be deviated by this exit/entry of the ring.
A seriously injured child in an attraction to Disneyland Paris
A child of five years seriously was injured following an accident on an attraction to Disneyland Paris.
His vital prediction is not engaged anymore but it always is hospitalized.
At the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean ones".
She was closed until new order.
Snowden is ready to "to cooperate" with the Germany on the question of the American supervision
Edward Snowden, the denunciatory one of the services of American pieces of information, declared that it was disposed to go to Berlin to testify in front of the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and his director Keith Alexander did not furnish responses on their activities.
The German representative Hans christian Ströbele met Thursday Mr. Snowden in Russia, where it benefits from the refuge right, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the representative presented to the media to Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was quite obviously positive, my government continues to treat the opinion difference as an escape and tries penalize the political speech with accusations against which ones it is impossible to defend itself."
Nevertheless, say the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that it thought that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the penal loads withheld against him.
In the framework of the complaint deposited by the American ministry of justice, it is accused spying and of flight of goods of the State.
Hans peter Friedrich, minister of the German Interior, declared to the Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with the German people in charge, we will do in goes out to return that possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany were put to rough test following complaints according to which ones the NSA had put on listens the portable telephone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the representative that directs the parliamentary group supervising the secret services foreigners, indicated that if it there had a chance to hear Mr. Snowden by way of witness "without endangering it and completely to ruin the relations with the United States", it was necessary to profit from it.
Mr. Ströbele, German Green representative, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his account Twitter.
At the time of his visit in Russia, it was accompanied of two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele declared that, according to the lawyer of the old consultant one NSA, Mr. Snowden could not return in Russia if it left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, it would be necessary to give him the assurance that it would be in "security" over there, declared the representative.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that it had been the object of a persecution country "engraves and sustained" that had forced it to leave his country.
Nevertheless, it said that it had been encouraged by the world-wide reaction facing "my act of political expression".
The citizens of the entire world as well as the high representatives – including to the United States – judged that the inexplicable revelation of a system of permanent supervision was public usefulness.
The letter advances a cooperation offer with German authorities "when the humanitarian difficulties of this position will have been resolved".
A team of biologists directed by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new type of heir apparent to bump to the wide one northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, loaded with scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and the Etude of the Animals and Sea Environments (OCEAMM) returns for THE Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new types.
Does the discovery of this new type of heir apparent to bump you astonish?
This is a good new one, but that astonishes me not particularly.
If by the passed, the types were described and identified on basis morphologique, anatomical and geographic, today, the development of new tools such as the genetic one allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of the types.
It is not besides impossible that these progress in genetic and in molecular biology question the classification or the membership of a type to a kind, a family, indeed even an order.
At first 19th century, the morphologistes classified the animals, on the basis of the differences morphologiques between the types.
Today, certain of these classifications are questioned because of the progress of the genetic one.
Same manner, two types very close morphologiquement were distinguished thanks to the genetic one.
It is the case of the new type that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two types belonging to this under family: the heirs apparent to bump of the Pacific and the whales to bump of the Atlantic.
The recent analyses allowed distinguishing four types.
Why is it a question of an importance discovery as asserted it the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From the standpoint conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the type and therefore his genetic variability.
If this population already was known since a long time by the researchers, they did not know that she was part of a new type, presents only to this place.
From that time, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or of accidental capture puts itself in the region, we could have to deal with the extinction of a type, rather than to a local disappearance of a population of a type more more more widely more shed on Earth.
This gene pool loss would be a lot more problematic one.
A type is considered threatened or in the process of extinction according to the number of existing individuals on Earth, that is to say stock, and possibility that she has to reestablish itself from the stocks neighbors.
With regards to the type Sousa chinensis, of which the population of the new discovered type is originating from, his stock automatically became weaker, the return thus more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new types of sea mammals?
The sea mammals are situated at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous habitats, opened, in which these there are many genetic exchanges between the populations and the individuals.
This intermingling of genes limit the creation of new types.
On the other hand, the more closed ecosystems favor the genetic isolation, that can generate to term the creation of new types.
It is necessary to know that the sea environment is the environment the less known good.
One prefers to send robots on March, that of knowledge which lives in the pit of the Mariannes, to only 11 kilometers of the surface of the sea.
One spends more money in the life research on the other planets than in the marine research and it is big time than that changes.
Cleave Caliper claims that the representative Tony Abbott has an interest conflict about the system of parental vacation.
The representative millionaire Cleaves Caliper advances that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has an interest conflict about the system of parental vacation because its girls could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
The magnate of the mining extraction, that protests the payment of a tax carbon of an amount of 6 M$, emphasized this argument to try to separate the questions concerning an eventual conflict.
The Caliper United Party could check until four voices to the Senate, which could be crucial at to decide if the taxes carbon and mining must be eliminated.
But Mr. Caliper claimed that only of the ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that the girls of Mr. Abbott were ready to profit personally of these political ones.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it will be a matter to pay the parental vacation for if the an of its girls is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the Fact that she obtains or not a vacation", declared Mr. Caliper.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Caliper won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 voices, after recomptage.
Mr. Caliper advanced the idea of a remaniement of the system of remains of the votes to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, France and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished?
"We need a better system", it declared.
Why not could we have a system in which can enter yourself, seize your coordinated ones in a computer, vote immediately and have the result to 6h30 the next day morning?
Mr. Caliper also criticized the usage of pencils of paper to mark the vote bulletins.
Is this to be able to obliterate the result if someone is not agreed?
These days, have a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The electoral Commission studied the possible options in the matter of the electronic vote and recently published a document of joint reflection with New Zealand.
Mr. Caliper, 59 years, declared that his political project understood an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that it would take its new functions "very to the serious one".
The exercise of public functions is a question of public service.
"We do not look for any reward, excepted the reward of the history for we must serve the community to a moment criticizes", it added.
When many experts in equestrian demonstrations met to Cardiff to confront itself and win the trophy of the Horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one expected to see won Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years.
Not again to the school and only some months after doing its first weapons, the all small and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three turns with a big ease and won the first price, leaving behind them the 30 competing others adults.
The two inseparable ones – that are same size – were greeted for the presentation, the attitude and the style at the time of the annual competition that unfolded itself to the equestrian center Sunnybank, to Rudry close to Cardiff.
Presenting itself against men and women in hats melons elegant, it carried his flat cap a little on the side in a relaxed way to let his pony march Toffee 2 years old around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for its natural qualities of training not very common for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and his personality.
Fenton had Toffee in gift for his 3E anniversary in last March and trained since with his pony Shetland everyday.
His mother Gave, 30 years, declared: "Fenton and Toffee do an excellent duet."
They presented themselves despite all opposition, but the two swiped the cutting in now and the rosette.
It was only the second time that it competed with Toffee and we were crazy joy that it won.
On the track, people that did not know it thought that it was so phenomenal that they wanted to do themselves to photograph with him.
This young boy, town of Nantyglo, close to Ebbw Is worth, in the south of the country of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, that participates in equestrian competitions since more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells declared: "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it."
It traversed the very length of the track while running and even if it seemed to be all small one, it did a wonderful work.
Fenton is crazy animals – it loves the horses, the tractors and the rural world and has two chickens of which it takes care.
Manner of which it began, it will participate surely soon to the demonstration of the Horse of the year – and I am sure that it will do a beautiful benefit.
A spokesperson of the annual equestrian demonstration declared: "Fenton has only 3 years but it knows how to drive his pony."
They form a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the manner of which they marched on the track.
They look for a work of effective team between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the better ones on the track.
I am sure that its beautiful clothing helped Fenton, it had really proud pace.
The minister of the Defense, Rob Nicholson, insisted to say that the injured soldiers briefly were not liberated Canadian armed Forces, and underlined that a transition process was followed by all the soldiers before their return to civil life.
Attacked by the liberals and the neos democrats to the Room of the towns, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their liberation, the members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superior ones.
All the injured soldiers receipts the fitting cares regarding their return to civil life and none of them is liberated before being ready, it asserted.
The detractors accuse the government to want to save money while not allowing the injured military officers - that do not reply to the rule of "the universality of the service" exacting army that the personnel is in a position to carry out a series of varied tasks - to attain the period of acceptability of 10 required years for the retirement benefits.
They notably quoted two cases retrieved by The Canadian Press, of which the one of a liberated soldier last Friday.
The corporal David Hawkins, a reservist of London, in Ontario, attains syndrome of post-traumatique anxiety, was liberated army despite his request to remain a year of more in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case is arisen after the one of the corporal Glen Kirkland, that declared in front of a parliamentary commission, the last months, that it had been pushed towards the before being ready exit because it did not reply to the rule of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins underlined that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and meetings of consultation, but that that was totally different that the fact to want to leave the rows.
"I said them that I was not ready", it asserted at the time of an interview with The Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked during months if there was a means for that I can remain, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fight in Afghanistan, the army pains to determine which latitude she can grant to the injured soldiers that want to remain in the rows, but that are not apt in battle.
By virtue of the current rules, the seriously injured soldiers have until three years to reestablish itself.
If they do not reply to the criteria for the deployments abroad, they can be forced to leave the army.
Presented data the last year to the Parliament indicate that among the 1218 liberated soldiers for medical reasons, 199 had not attained the length of required service to obtain from the benefits of retirement.
The liberal spokesperson in the matter of former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday the reinstatement of the corporal Hawkins, while the neo democrat Jack Harris claimed the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Aerial raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, airplanes Israelis entered into the Lebanese aerial space Wednesday at the beginning of afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of missiles ground air of short reach HIS-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid one aviation of Tsahal in Syrian territory (the sixth one since the beginning of the year, according to the Newspaper Israeli Haaretz) was not confirmed or by Israel or by the Syria.
The raid unfolded itself in circumstances almost the same as the one that had taken place July 5: to the era, it is also an anonymous American person in charge who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aiming this time missiles ground sea Yakhont, books by the Russia to Damask.
The Israeli people in charge had not hidden their irritation to see Washington to reveal the attack, to the risk to oblige the president Assad to react.
Prison to life for a former vice governor Chinese
A former vice governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeast of China, was condemned Friday to the prison to life for corruption.
Exclude from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused to have touched more than 19 million yuans of jars-of-wine, retrieve the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, that was equally the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public establishment, helped businesses and people in charge to obtain contracts, ready or promotions in exchange for money or of gifts, declared the first intermediary court of Peking on his microblog.
The president Xi Jinping, that took its functions in last March, did the fight against the corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon constituted a threat to the existence same of the Communist Party.
If the boss of the State promised that justice would be so inflexible with the powerful ones "tigers" as with the "wipe" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of people in charge of high row were condemned, among which these of former frameworks of the oil giant Petrochina.
The recent case the most spectacular one was the one of the former boss of the PCC to Chongqing, Bo Xilai, condemned to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after aiming the highest functions within the State.
But the government not not in the least showed the intention to reform the fight system against the corruption while creating for example an independent organism on the part.
The profit of Bomber in decrease, while the deliveries and the airplane orders back up
Bomber Inc, aeronautical and Canadian rail builder signaled a fall of 15% of his net profit Thursday, under the pressure of a decrease of the orders and deliveries of airplanes during the third quarter and of contractual problems in his division Trains.
Bomber, based to Montreal, not not did more furnish data of essay in flight for his very new airplane CSeries or of information allowing knowledge if the airplane will respect his ambitious calendar of put one in commercial service before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the airplane of essay there is about a months and half, the latter flew only three times, and the question then put itself knowledge if the essay phase was in good way.
The results were not at the height of the anticipations and the current of the actions backed up of 8% to the stock Market of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst within the National Bank Financial, lowered Thursday his notation, passing of "surperformance" to "sector performance" because of the weak potential one of raises stock market during the next quarter or of the two next quarters.
"Although the decrease of the deliveries of airplanes was largely early, we really disappointed by the profitable margin in the division Transportation", declared Cameron Doerksen in a grade to the customers.
We think that Bomber will record new orders for its airplanes CSeries while the essay program in flight will advance.
Nevertheless, if no new order is announced during the course of the next months, we expect that the market becomes more skeptical on the subject of the program.
Bomber hopes that the family of airplanes CSeries will be able to catapult it in the inferior segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first airplane of essay was unveiled in March and flew away itself for the first time in September after the delay months.
But the number of orders close for the airplanes CSeries is modest so far to height of 177. It seems that the potential buyers await the results of the essays in flight to validate the affirmations of the corporation concerning energetic effectiveness and the potential one of economies of the new airplane of line.
At the present time, the corporation recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase engagements with 15 customers and operators.
Rock Beaudoin, president and boss of the direction, is convinced that Bomber will attain his objective of 300 orders close before the placement in commercial service of the first airplane.
The leaders equally reassured the analysts and the media Thursday while their indicating that the program advanced in accordance with the calendar.
"The essay airplane did not remain at the ground a long time than foreseen", declared Mr. Beaudoin at the time of a telephone lecture, adding that the essays to the ground and updated them logicielles were foreseen during the time of stop of the airplane.
Every builder plans in a manner different.
We had decided to proceed to a first flight and to foresee a period of updated, and this we did.
That will reproduce itself throughout the flight program.
The second one of the five airplanes of essay should fly away itself in the weeks to come, the others will follow little time after, indicated the corporation.
Nevertheless, the analysts are skeptical as for the Fact that the first customer can do to fly an airplane CSeries only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bomber indicated that she was evaluating the entry calendar in service and will furnish new information during the next months.
"This slowness of the essays in flight – although she is apparently in accordance with the internal calendar of Bomber – reinforces our opinion according to which the entry in service will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015", declared Mr. Doerksen.
To the third closed quarter September 30, the net profit of Bomber fell to 147 M$, or 8 hundred by action, in comparison with 172 M$, or 9 hundred by action, a year earlier.
The result by tailored action remained unchanged to 9 hundred.
Income lightly backed up of 4.2 to 4.1 Md$.
The analysts expected a result of 10 hundred by action and income of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aeronautical builder to the world indicated that it had delivered 45 airplanes during the quarter, against 57 a year earlier.
The net orders fell to 26 airplanes, against 83 beforehand.
The delay in the Aeronautical division represented 32.9 Md$ to September 30, unchanged figure in comparison with December 31 of the preceding year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were in accordance with our anticipations, but the weak number of orders and the general conditions of the market were disappointing", declared Mr. Beaudoin.
The income of the Aeronautics lowered of 13% to attain 2 Md$.
Bomber, the biggest rail builder to the world, declared that the income of this division had increased closely of 11% to 2.1 Md$.
The notebook of orders of the division Transportation totaled 32.6 Md$ to September 30, is a light increase in comparison with December 31 of the preceding year.
The margins of the division Transportation suffered from the problems of execution concerning some big contracts.
The leaders announced that of new indications would be furnished during the fourth quarter.
The course of the actions of Bomber, that equally announced that Patrick Pichette, boss of the financial direction of Google Inc, would sit to the board of directors, fell of 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian corporation Embraer HIS, third aeronautical builder to the world and competitor more close of Bomber, indicated Thursday a decrease of 10% of his quarterly profit.
The press kenyane itself unworthy of the controversial law on the media
"It is a frightful country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what that will prevent the Parliament to sweep the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?", declared the newspaper while protesting the project of law and asking what it is declared unconstitutional.
"This law is drastic and very punitive, and we refuse it", explained Cyrus Kamau, general director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, the one of the stations of radio and sites Internet independent current the done more respect to the Kenya.
It indicated that the new court of the media "will always be partial for it is a matter of an extension of the government" and that the restrictions relating to the content and to advertising would harm instead of the Kenya in the world-wide economy.
"I hope that the president will listen us, and we ask him to reject this project of law and to send back it in front of the parliamentary ones", it added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new project of law will allow the government to have "the mainmise on the media". Standard The has, for his part, indicated that the democracy and opinion liberty to the Kenya "had undergone a hard blow" and castigated the law project qualifying it of "drastic".
The adoption of the project of law intervenes at the same time that a train of measures aiming to reinforce the national security in the wake of the perpetrated attack by armed Islamists in the commercial center of Westgate in last September.
The media kenyans gave rise to the anger of authorities while broadcasting pictures of movie cameras of vidéosurveillance on which ones the deployed troops on the scene of the attack supposedly robbed the commercial center of luxury.
The boss of the police, David Kimaiyo, reacted while summoning two journalists and a person in charge of the media to question them, although summoning was withdrawn after a got up shields in the media.
By virtue of the new project of law, the media will be able to be liable of amend going until 20 millions of shillings kenyans and the journalists until 1 million with the additional risk to be "removed" or of not more to be able to receive official in a hurry accreditation.
The court has equally the strength to seize the goods of a contravening one if this one did not pay his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine suffices to paralyze most of the stations FM".
It says equally that the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as the "animated blogosphère" Kenya.
While reducing the media to the silence, the politicians know that they can do what they want in any impunity.
"No one will know never", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist to The Nation, while describing the media kenyans as a source of check key in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, the politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and we would bring back to the hunt and to picking."
The legislators kenyans were the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they adopted a definite position against the cuttings ordered by the national Commission in charge of the salaries and reestablished their fabulous salaries of about 532 000 shillings by exempted months of tax – that figure among the more students to the world.
Two spéléologues of 23 and 27 years were reported missing in a gulf under the Tooth of Crolles since Thursday evening, one has learn Friday with the Spéléo helps Isère.
They were localized this Friday-afternoon one.
The two men, the one hardened to the practice and the other no, had left under earth Thursday towards 21h30 in order to carry out a crossing of the Tooth of Crolles, situated on the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
One was then without new of them since, specified the same source.
"The spéléologues should have gone out again to the surroundings of 5H in the morning", said Thierry Larribe, technical counselor to the Spéléo helps in charge of the organization of the relief.
Tens of people on the spot
About twenty first-aid workers, ten civil members of the Spéléo helps French, as well as policemen, CRS and firemen were on the spot.
In afternoon end this Friday, the two spéléologues were localized.
"It is another groups spéléologues that, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, transmitted the information to the one of the teams of engaged relief in the network" explains The Dauphiné.
The two military officers to the 13E battalion of the alpine Hunters of Chambéry, were rediscovered "exhausted, but non-injureds".
They lost themselves in the network, returned on their steps while awaiting the relief, specified the prefecture.
Réalimentés, they should go out again cavity with the assistance of the first-aid workers in the evening.
An inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let's not cheat especially.
In the spirit of abdel-malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Party of the suburbs" addresses itself not only to the suburban ones.
I chose a card of France as logo, justifies it t-il.
When I talk about suburbs, I address to myself all those that are excluded from the big national family.
It does not prevent, his project, presented Thursday in press conference in his natal town of Aubervilliers, was born of the will of more better to defend multiculturalism, this big melting jar cultural that characterizes before all the neighborhoods.
My suggestion n° 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, indicates it t-il.

"The sensational declarations on the" foreigners returning at the end of the line" and "jobs for the Australians first" are an unpleasant return to the era where the unions asked a market of the protected work", she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant that the work of the White ones had to be protected – and I would not be surprised that certain countries of the region there see as an echo to this historic artéfact.
The working document mentions the 12 measures that previously had been envisioned by the former minister of the Immigration Chris Bowen.
The minister of the Immigration Brendan O'Connor, that was at the Sri Lanka to meet high representatives in order to discuss the illegal dealings in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being in examination course.
If the criterion "of authenticity" was adopted, a petitioner of aim could be checked for knowledge "if the job offer is authentic if the candidate is a relation or a personal associate of the owner or concerned person within the business that sponsors it".
The businesses could equally be held to declare the number of possessors of aim 457 after certain of between they, having had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers, some have in employed fact of the hundreds.
Meanwhile, a petitioner of refuge sri-lankais of 35 years would be dead of a cardiac crisis after arriving on a transporting boat of the petitioners of refuge to the island Christmas this week.
The panic-stricken son of the man, 9 years old, went in Australia with him and found some consolation since the death of his father Wednesday with an adult cousin that was equally on board.
The man was transferred urgency by Australian authorities to the hospital of the island Christmas, where it deceased.

The stop returned by the court of appeals means that the doctors that will practice IVG will have to have access to an "admission privilege" with the local hospitals.
The admission privilege is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his statute of caring one for member of a hospital, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center in order there to deliver a diagnosis or a treatment.
Defender of them the IVG argue that the content of the law risks translating itself by an immediate closing of a third of the clinics of the State for these clinics did not succeed obtaining this "admission privilege" for their general practitioners.
Altogether, this would be close to 22,000 women that would be deprived of an access to these establishments.
Monday, a judge of first instance had estimated on the eve of the entry in force of the law that the disposals treating privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of the Texas, the republican Greg Abbott, that covets the post of governor, asked the court of appeals to cancel the judgement of first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary audience on this question is foreseen for the months of January.

This drama pornographique shells, in eight chapters that go out in two shutters (the 1st and January 8 2014), the erotic memories of a forty-year accro to the sex since his adolescence.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with his elder one is striking: a twig outline, a hazy complexion and English French origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of the risk: the one that had not hesitated to put nude on frozen paper will post itself in positions well more sulfureuses on big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac let the temperature climb on the Web: Stacy Martin there appears to the bed and in the middle of the ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative film director asked its actors to put their modesty to the placard, it had recourse to professionals of the X for the sex scenes the more dared, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, this is the star; to the under, the stand-in.
Of Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, while going through Nicole Kidman, Lars von To Sort has for habit to push its actresses in their last entrenchments, always for the better one.
Stacy Martin did not finish to do to talk about her.
Five years ago already that my father obliterated himself world of the living ones.
At first I denied his death, I talked about him to the present,
I had so fear to forget it or rather I knew not how I was going to continue to the "to frequent".
It does not exist any recipe, of method of job to pass the wall of the invisible one and to rediscover his.
Then signs appeared.
The first time this was the very felt fort of his presence on the fleeting seat while I drove.
Another time, a soft awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that does not leave me more, borne on the night table.
It is the smiling picture of my father who accompanies me in my gestures to the Newspaper.
Our mother left us after his exhausting fight against the cancer.
This is less what I thought the day where I found his body empties, made tense on this hospital bed to the crumpled sheet.
All the same, its funeral were an icy farewell focused around the lean glimmer of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought that she had left.
Little by little, by small daytime or night apparitions, a not very shy, a little obliterated, she quickly returned in my spirit, evolving while she resumed his place in the landscape of my thought that believed itself in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while unveiling me my own facets that I again had not perceived, masked by my relation with her.
I have therefore learn and understand that I not in the least had lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I knew not really, a woman that embodied this person, during his stay in life.
While dying, this woman had perfect his life and liberated the person that I liked, and here that I rediscovered it, full and entire.
This detour of the way of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful one.
It is a knowledge privilege that the liked people never leave us.
I resemble my father, "to the inside as to the outside" it adorned.
One always said it for me.
I never believed it the era.
I had difficult relations with him until it becomes old, sick.
There, I not was afraid anymore of him and I was able to like it.
A day, it is dead.
During a long time, it accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I had poorly...
It spoke me, encouraged me constantly, it lived my body.
I saw its hands while looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But this was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
It left me my intimacy.
That lasted a long time then a day it left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, counseled.
I no longer know that said than the deceased people are not of the forgotten but invisible.
My parents no longer are but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every instant of my life does me to feel their presence for I myself there always refer: that would they have said? that would they have thought? that would have- they does?
I dream constantly of them, maybe not all the nights but several times a week it is certain.
I dream often last instants that I must divide with them before it is too late, only, there always is a thing that prevents me from accomplish this moment.
I awaken often anxious when that arrives me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, certain dreams carry me on the contrary and are in line with themselves my history and effectively, they continue to live and to divide my life.
The day before of my échographie where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I awakened, I hoisted myself outside the bed, my father awaited me on the bearing and it smiled me and rejoiced that I await a small boy.
The next day, I felt that it had returned me visits in my sleep to mean me that it divided with joy which arrived me.
And of course, this was a small boy in my stomach.
I liked to divide this moment with him and I take pleasure to relate this common memory lived after his death.
There are precisely five years, my grandmother died of the continuations of a cancer.
A year beforehand, she was in trip with my family to Gauged.
It is to say the shock that his disappearance provoked with the young graduate that I was at the era.
I have despite all realized my mourning enough quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, notably in the moments where I am located in difficulty, or well when I must take important decisions.
Learn the Arab and to be very interested in me the Middle East, to the point of some do a master in a big school, were not, with the decline, harmless choices.
Indeed, I heard it often to speak Arabic in my childhood, and to talk about Morocco, there where she had lived during decades - before regaining the France at the independence.
The values that she inculcated me always are present, so well that it arrives me to think about how she would want that I act to a given moment.
It leaves of even for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and integrity of spirit of the one that was a fervent believing one.
Henceforth, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see its eyes to bear on themselves me.
My mother deceased nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking on the phone me.
I am gone through all the phases: lack of understanding, anger, the pain, the pleurs that release themselves only, anywhere, does not import when, in unusual places, out-of-place moments.
Then, the time appeased the penalty.
Remained only the lack, this emptiness without response, this need of her, to entrust me, to reassure me to the hollow one of his softness.
Nevertheless, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see its worried eyes to bear on themselves me, I see the rings that weigh down his look, the ridules around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the pleats that mark the forehead the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I divert the eyes.
My woman and the mother of my 3 children deceased of a cancer to 43 years.
One feels in permanence his protection, nothing of engrave not we can arrive.
It was his promise on his pain bed, then one has little by little learn again to smile, and to pronounce his name no longer is taboo but a consolation.
Well on, I speak him in the hollow one night when the absence done too poorly, she invites herself in my dreams when the morale a little is attained.
We feel carried and protected in the difficult moments, the decline of the time does us to realize how much she was boss of orchestra and we try to remain in the way that she had traced ourselves.
If a being liked you very strong, the absence cannot pull out it for you heart and memories.
In a way, to be liked it becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father August 22 2008 of the continuations of a cancer of asbestos.
I was very close of him, I always acted according to what it thought or of what it appreciated.
I was not able to attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a small boy.
If I have my sometimes different convictions of hers, I always wonder if my schemes are in accordance with his vision of the things.
I have besides had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in an opposite direction, I not some sleep and I always wonder what it will think some.
I do not know if I adopted his manner to be or if I am simply as him: is this genetic one?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a little as an alter-ego, there was not need to speak between we.
Brief, it is there to the Newspaper.
I feel his presence and that renders happy me.
Veiled soon thirty years that my husband deceased at the age of 33 years.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years.
The immense penalty that then invaded me of course lessened but it always is close to me.
Very often it "lands" in my dreams of a manner if precise, so living that upon waking I am even sadder to note that it is only a dream.
The other night, it asked me if I went well, I said him no, it replies me "I descend" but of a so real voice that I awakened in start, worried and I lit the bedside lamp while looking at everywhere, persuaded that it was going to arrive.
I live still in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I return myself to see if it is not there, I know that this is him and I speak him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and that renders happy me.
For nothing to the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I always lived alone since his departure, it is and will remain the love of my life.
I am anxious to specify that I am sociable with a trade to responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and my soul belong him and I never speak of him safe with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.

Mohamed Morsi lent the nomination oath, but it is not very probable that his day of triumph marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when it lent the nomination oath to the presidency, becoming thus the first freely elected and succeeding president to Hosni Moubarak that was hunted strength 16 months earlier.
At the time of his nomination in front of the High constitutional course, Mr. Morsi equally became the first Islamist freely elected president of the Arabic world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
It lent oath in front of the 18 judges in black dress of the Course of which the situated building in edge of the Nil was constructed to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We inhale to better consequences, a new Egypt and a second republic", declared the president Morsi during the solemn live broadcast ceremony on the public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people put the foundations of a new life – absolute liberty, a true democracy and stability", explained Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed to the United States, coming from the Moslem Brothers, a group fondamentaliste considered during more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by the successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local hour, followed by a small convoy.
Only some hundreds of supporters had mustered themselves in front of the Course to acclaim the new president and, distancing itself of the auspicious presidential one years Moubarak, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequented streets linking up the center city to the suburbs south.
Considered as the "spare tire" not very charismatic Moslem Brothers, his personal prestige considerably reinforced itself since his victory and his speech of Friday to the course of which it tried to present itself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those that want to finish the started work at the time of the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian president Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern State", declared Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing to itself the present judges in the decorated room of woodwork where it lent oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the university of Cairo where it pronounced his nomination speech.
It officially was welcomed by a military brass band that played the national hymn while it put himself to the guard-to-you.
The marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
To his arrival, it was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, hand in the hand. ..” started singing by thousands of mustered people in the big amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of the civil education, the university of Cairo became later a fief of the groups of Islamist students in the years 1970.
Mr. Morsi did a symbolic oath Friday on the place Tahrir, from which left the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian system of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential strengths of which the military counsel, that replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed it.
But while accepting lending officially oath in front of the Course, rather than in front of the Parliament as it is usage, it bows to the will of the army while showing that the fight for the strength is not finished.
The speech of Mr. Morsi on the place Tahrir was accompanied spectacular populist gestures.
The avionneurs quarrel on the subject of the width of the seats while of big orders are in game
The dispute done fumes between the big aeronautical builders about the width of the seats of the economy class on the long flights mails, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the time of the aeronautical parlor of Dubaï that takes place months here.
The conflict concerns the width of the proposed seats on the long flights mails to the passengers of the economical class – that not always the are more wooed by the airline companies, but to which ones spaces it allocated is essential to increase the effectiveness gains in the last devices presented by Airbus HIS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the aeronautical industry to set up an imposing norm a size of seat of at least 18 thumbs (45,72 cm) in the economical classes, but his big American rival Boeing declares that this should be at the airline companies to decide.
The disagreement has burst while the avionneurs try sell versions even bigger of their long airplanes twin-engined mails, while hoping eventually a record of orders at the time of the event that will unfold itself of the 17 to November 21.
The manner of which the seats will be disposed at the back airplane – in particular, there it will have 9 or 10 seats of forehead – is essential for the economical yield of the segment of the "mini-jumbo".
Boeing declares that his "777X" réaménagé will be able to welcome in class economical 406 people in seats of more than 17 thumbs of wide one, and will be configured with 10 seats by row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of his A350 will transport in class economical 350 people in seats of 18 thumbs of wide configured ones in arranged of 9.
The giants of the aeronautics exchange often blows on technical questions while doing the advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus in is called directly to the public before the aeronautical parlor of Dubaï, where the 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
One was able to go counts recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financial ones of a showing photo three people against one another to the restaurant, entitled "you would accept that?".
"Boeing proposes long flights mails in narrower seats than in the airplanes turbopropulseurs regional", indicated John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As the food habits change, the people increase, but the seats in the airplanes did not radically change.
Between the beginning of the years 1970, when the jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the long trip modern mail, and turning it century, the weight of the average American of 40 to 49 years increased of 10%, according to the data of the American department of Health.
The turn of size of the average American of the XXIe century is of 39.7 thumbs, according to American sanitary statistics.
Airbus declares that his rival hangs on to a seat concept that dates back to the years 1950, when the circumference of the fresh baptized device "throw set" was narrower.
Airbus adds that she ordered a study that indicates that an additional thumb at the level of the width of the seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53%.
Boeing protests the figures of Airbus in the matter of the width of the seats and asserts that this is not at the builders to decide manner of which the airline companies balance the price of the bills and the equipments.
It says equally that the study shows that the experience in telephone booth depends not only of the width of the seats.
"It is a matter really to bring flexibility to the airline companies and to allow them to do what they think to have to do to accomplish their activities", declared Kent Craver, in charge of the fleeting satisfactions with Boeing.
They do not want that one says them what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than person.
For the passengers, it is a more matter to have a certain liberty of movement, but for the suppliers, it is more and more a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute hides itself a race to the airplane orders for an estimated amount of at least 700 Md$ to the price of the market in the decades to come, sufficiently to let the balance of the American and European exportations lean.
As Reuters indicated it for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what supplies the battle between the all last devices.
Airbus and Boeing claim both of them a yield by seat in their last models of long twin-engined mails 20% superior one to the one of the leader of the market in this segment, the Boeing 777-300 ER of 365 seats.
Performances announced by Boeing depend in left the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats by row and a model 777 of configured origin in arranged of 9.
The gain in terms of unitary costs is weak compare to the configured device with 10 seats by row currently in service.
"Boeing done that to be able to put more seats and return its more competitive airplanes in comparison with our products", declared Kevin Keniston, director of Fleeting Comfort with the European avionneur Airbus.
Of another side, the said analysts that the configured telephone booths with 10 seats by row in the 777 existing ones suggest that many passengers pronounce themselves in favor of a denser configuration, that can keep pace with less dear tariffs.
"A width of seat of 18 thumbs would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, from the standpoint commercial, the suggestion of Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777", declared the experte in interiors of telephone booths Mary Kirby, founder and editor in boss of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not furnish any seats, but propose a catalog of suppliers among which these the airline companies must choose.
The airplane salesmen that do the turn of the world take even with them a meter to verify the competing configurations.
While blowing itself to propose comfortable devices, all the builders offer airplanes equally with configurations to strong density to the airline companies low-cost and for the regional trips.
Airbus offers one A350 configured with 10 seats by row but indicates that it did not again sell it.
Until recently, Airbus underlined the necessity of a bigger personalization of the telephone booths while offering wider seats side gone on certain of its airplanes.
Without the support of the only other big builder of big modern devices, the said experts that it is not very probable that his call to the aeronautical industry regarding to set up a norm of size for the seats results, but that it could make to forget the wave of sales of 777X.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the novel of Denis Diderot boasts itself of a remarkable artistic direction and of a meticulous reconstruction of era, but she is equally more laborious than she should not be it.
Unfolding itself in the France of the years 1760, she relates the dark history of Suzanne, a young sharp aristocrat in a convent by his family.
When she rebels, she does facing the cruelty without boundary of a Superior deliberately sadistic Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film not towards never in the lechery or the sensationnalisme, and this is well the problem.
The conscientious solennité of the narration could equally become a penitence for the public.
The musical comedy, this scene beast
Classical, artificial, popular, in English or in French, the sung and danced productions take their envol.
After Broadway and London, Paris finds at last his voice.
This is a revolution: the musical to the Frenchwoman asserts herself as a kind to success.
A long time, of Our Lady of Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts got entangled in the ridiculous one.
And the successes as Cabaret or The Miserable ones carried the ring of the mystery.
The arrival of John luc Choplin to the Châtelet and of Training­ ­Entertainment to Mogador changed the data.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as tubes to success.
The first one resumes, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world-wide creation of "An American to Paris".
To Mogador, "The Beautiful and the Beast" well being one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, the musical spectacles as “1789"," the lovers of the Fortress" and the small musical comedies as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves to the tuner of the success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the book of reference "Histories of musical comedies" and lecturer to the Theater of the Châtelet, analyzes the reasons of the success so harshly conquer.
How do the French musical comedies evolve?
The offer reduced itself.
There is first them "musical spectacles" that evolve to the taste producers...
Some use of ­beautiful projections of pictures and one ­true history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Fortress.
Of others do a leap of fifteen years behind under pretext that one can serve almost ­does not import what when one has Matt ­Pokora in poster head.
After, one has the musical comedies with the ­sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that we let the age relive of now of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the biggest one ­living composer.
Training ­Entertainment popularizes musical comedies Anglo-saxons of variety while adapting them in French.
The ­independent French producers attempt one ­pierced.
But projects in course as "Rent", "To Kiss It woman spider" or "THE Awakening of the ­spring" have trouble to be financed.
Do we have enough capable artists as to Broadway of singer, play and dance?
To Paris, when there are eight musical spectacles in a season, this is a big year.
We have 200 artists of talent that turn projects at the planning stage.
To the United States, cradle of the musical comedy, this is very different.
The young ones are formed to these trades in many schools.
The jobs are numerous between the regional theaters, turned, Broadway, the off-Broadway..
The talent vivier is as consequent as the number of posts to provide.
Why do the turns in province have as much success?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Few plays leave in turned and this is often of the ­boulevard theater intend for the adults and not to the young adults.
The musical spectacles fill this ­lacks.
It is these same young people who like the téléréalité and which she produces as fleeting stars...
To propose of the young beautiful men (often talentueux) in head of poster of a musical spectacle, is the assurance of a fad of these girls and often of their entire family.
The pages Facebook of these spectacles are learnedly ­held by professionals that reply to the questions.
These spectacles are very awaited when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise brought up to Paris and tasted by the provincial ones.
The show is conceived to enter into all the big rooms of France under the same form that to Paris.

Well Greenman: Anniversary tenth New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place where was born the stand up in America: there are almost 100 years, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, that held the role of master of ceremony to the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began relating of the joke directly in front of the public, on the tone of the conversation.
The innovation of Fay perpetuated itself with the passing of the years, until to be resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of stand up Carolines, the festival celebrates his tenth birthday this year, with more than 60 presented spectacles in small clubs and big theaters.
"Most of the heads of poster emerged to the Carolines, and knew a big success, until they became too famous to play in a club", declared Hirsch.
We created this festival with the intention of to be able to continue to work with them.

Jenny Slate participated in the transmission "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she nevertheless is more known for his series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes One".
Kroll and Slate, as well as of others young actors to unique voice (the surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
The one of the principal factors of attraction of the festival this year will be a discussion: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as actor of stand up, but it became a director of movie and of accomplished television, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, it animated a transmission on TV Land that was called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The appointment takes place at the town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitively in the comical DNA of the whole work of Larry", declared Steinberg.
It said me that, when it was here, sometimes it brought down a lane between two buildings and was said well, if I lose all my money, maybe that I will come to live here.

The Syria destroyed the essential equipments to the production of chemical weapons and of full munitions of toxic gas, declared the international organism of supervision of the chemical weapons Thursdays, while of violent clashes did fumes in the north of the country, nearby of the one of the sites where of the toxic agents are supposed to be stocked.
A group of Syrian campaign equally declared Thursday that more than 120 000 people were killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country there is close to 3 years.
The announcement of the Organization for the ban of the chemical weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day in advance on the date limit of the
1st November fixed by the based organization to The ordering Hague to Damask to destroy or "to render unusable" all the unities of production of chemical weapons and the destined machines to mix the toxic gasses and to fill the munitions.
The achievement of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step of the aiming ambitious calendar to destroy the chemical weapons of Damask of here mi-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipments, the Syria will not be anymore able to produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damask again must start up the destruction of the weapons and existing reserves.
One thinks that the country has access to about 1 000 tons of products and of chemical weapons, notably gas mustard and the agent neurotoxique sarin.
The announcement was done while the fight did fumes Thursday in the city of Safira that, according to the experts, shelters a unity of production of chemical weapons as well as sites of storage, retrieved the Syrian Observatory of the based human rights in Great Britain.
The group of campaign, that follows the evolution of the human report thanks to a network of based campaign in Syria, declared Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.

The el-assad troops fight against the rebels, of which good number are linked to groups of the network Al-qaeda, to Safira since weeks.
The observatory declared Thursday that there were losses of the two sides, but did not give any precision.
The fight underlined the importance of the dangers to which ones are confronted the loaded inspectors of the chemical weapons while they must finish their mission, that consist in to rid the toxic Syria of his arsenal in the middle of a civil war that continues, in squeezed delays.
A declaration of the OIAC, that works in narrow collaboration with the UN, indicated that his team was "now satisfied to have checked – and seen destroyed – critical declared the very production and the machines intend for the mixture and to the filling up".

Two employees of the accused YMCA of sexual aggressions after formulated allegations in opposition to Jonathan Lord, at the time of an audience of the royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New Wales of the South were accused sexual aggressions against children after formulated allegations in opposition to the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at the time of an audience of the royal Commission loaded sexual abuses on the children.
But in his opening declaration in front of the Commission, the YMCA declared that it "had never had to treat of a problem of sexual aggression on children within his organization".
The general director Phillip Hare was questioned on the subject of two matters: an employee of the YMCA was accused offences relating to childish pornography and a supervisor of physical education of the YMCA Caringbah Lobby was recognized guilty sexual aggressions on children in the center where it worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare declared to Gail Furness, lawyer counsel with the Commission, that it had had knowledge of the first matter but that it was not during the course of the second.
It equally admitted that the declaration of opening of the YMCA was inexact while underlining, "external checks of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the security of the children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was shown in front of the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the more bad seconds assessments on four establishments at the time of an audit quality of the Department of Education and Communities realized in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, that began working to the YMCA at the age of 21 years, admitted that the management of the personnel was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that it had omitted to verify that the employees knew that they were held to signal any violation of politics of security of the children.
Earlier in the year, Lord was condemned for sexual aggressions on twelve boys during the two years where it worked to the YMCA.
It was condemned to a penalty of 6 years of prison minimum.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea according to which the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing the personnel to signal the breaches of Lord towards the security of the children.
The members of the personnel testified that they had observed certain breaches, notably the Fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that it kept them deprived some, did them to sit on its knees, said them that it liked them and left them to play with his portable telephone.
Danielle Ockwell, that was framed by Lord and that had asked a formation regarding protection of the children for she worried about his behavior, indicated that she found the person in charge of the services to the childhood of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, that framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The general director said that it rejected the testimonies of the personnel according to which these they were reluctant to the idea to signal these breaches to their superior hierarchic one.
Instead of that, it declared that friendly relations that they maintained with Lord jumbled their judgement, which means that they did not signal its schemes.
Mr. Hare declared that it had expressed his view point in front of the counsel of the YMCA of New Wales of the said South that, for the organization, the pulled lesson of "the incident Jonathan Lord" did not have to concern "the signalement" by the personnel, and the counsel agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to do to sign to the personnel of the agreements of confidentiality, shortly after that allegations were evoked, was taken by the general director of the loaded YMCA of the services to childhood, Liam Whitley.
It declared that this decision was destined to avoid any contamination of the elements of proof but that it was a matter of an "excess of enthusiasm" and that she poorly had been implemented.
The YMCA of New Wales of the South was not a sure organization for the children to the era where Jonathan Lord there was employed, to knowledge between 2009 and 2011, declared the regarding violence sexual experts on the children, the Professor Stephen Smallbone of the university of Griffith in front of the Commission.
It indicated that there was of the "problems engrave" in recruitment, the check, the initiation, the formation and the supervision of the personnel.
The audience was postponed until December 20.
A ceremony in memory of the defunct crématisés
The crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a civil ceremony, in memory of all the defunct crématisés in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate to the city hall of Paris there must attend, and will explain next, at the time of a press conference its suggestions in the matter of funerary.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more of French choose cremation, rather than the inhumation: 53%, according to a study Ipsos realized the 6 and September 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a close one, this is the inverse one: the French prefer the inhumation (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book The Death in ashes, Damien The Guay, philosopher and vice president of the national Committee of ethics of the funerary one, insists on the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the liked body", that will be "reduced to an ash pile" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, that "would accompany the phases of the mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", that is anxious the" deletion of the oddity and distinctive signs" reduce to the" anonymity" ashes.
Why which is accepted easily in certain Nordic and Protestant countries it again poorly is lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact", replies Mary frédérique Bacqué, president of the Corporation of thanatologie and author of the book To Tame the death.
She is tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which limited the attempts to tame it.
To tame cremation, is for François michaud-nérard, general director of the funerary Services of the City of Paris, to foresee for the defunct one an as worthy ceremony as the one to which it would have straight with an inhumation.
The annual investigation of Ipsos shows a very strong devotion to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French in want one, for their close ones, that she is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Henceforth, 73% of the people having chosen a cremation wish the organization of a ceremony.
66% of the atheistic or not believing ones the desire also.
The crematoriums adapted themselves to this evolution of the corporation.
"Since about ten years, they strive to avoid to the families the violence of an expectation, without nothing to do, for an hour and half, immediately followed by the discount of the ashes", observes Mr. michaud-nérard.
70% of the establishments propose henceforth masters of ceremonies, that proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, name the defunct one, link up it to the others, evoke it, give feels to his death, organize the farewell.
This is the case to the crematorium of the Father Lachaise, since 1998.
The ceremony masters are often people that redeveloped themselves.
There are also Catholic former priests.
It is in this framework that the crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of The Toussaint, several ceremonies of the memory, civil and not religious, to which ones it invites the families of the people that were crématisées in the year.
For the second consecutive year, the one of these ceremonies is broadcast enligne, to the attention of those that could not do the movement.
The crematorium authorized us to relay it.

A white screen uses bottom wall.
On the rug, so white, in the immense space that is the Theater Maisonneuve, advances itself, of profile, fine as a line and clothed of black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes his form.
And this form will be the one of the very piece: an enfilade of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, completely clothed of black, only the hands and the discovered faces, await of every side of the area of game, precipitate themselves when the next written form appears, embody it, go out again while running.
This black and white game Henri Michaux is done in solo relay, in group to the unison (a mass that does solo), in big group of twelve solos where each executes his sign.
One thinks about "Glory in the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a task choreographic series written on coalitions, put online in the front scene.
This is the same principle, version PowerPoint gigantic.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the always quick rhythm.
There will be fracture when Carol Prior will take refuge himself under the dance rug, to deliver, microphone in hand, without or withheld abstemiousness, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocorde and monotonous in the screamed, and will follow while dancing.
And the music to set off again, and the sequence to resume.
This sonorous and long energetic disposal, if that can itself, ends up to deafen and deaden.
As the fact also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There is some beautiful flashes - the picture creation always was a force with Chouinard - as these hair that tousle themselves or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of to go to meet the work of Michaux, imposed, with its tics.
Result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, as forms of Gestalt, open an imaginary one wider and giboyeux than the dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers minced by a light stroboscopique and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches on the magic.
The public liked, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopédies, after the entr'acte, is richer.
The scene is in left draped of gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, as furnishings in an abandoned house.
To the piano, dancers take turns to play scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a true brittleness.
On scene, pass the couples, in in love, very sensual, even erotic duets.
Group work, small solos of transitions, bodies that move themselves, choirs, the writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, so familiar of Chouinard, sporting the red nose, in parades in love men women very polarized.
Loves are carnivorous, evasive or players.
The gestural one, the laughs and the small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridiculous one of the bodies in coitus, beings that are founded.
But the piece takes his real envol after the good day.
A clown returns in scene when the public leaves.
There, all becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes superimpose themselves, the dancers ham it up, descend among the spectators, comment, smoke, runs itself circuitent, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a learnedly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
The joy and the madness perspire, and this is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.

You recall that at that very moment, the president was not in form, and therefore one was said, "Lord, that we can do?".
While Daley qualified the examination of "collective", Martin indicated to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the reelection country a lot had invested to discover if the change would be beneficial at the time of the ballot.
"The countries do not consecrate a lot of monies to the polls and to the discussion groups unless they do not envision seriously to take measures", declared Martin on AC360.
Nevertheless, one does not know if Obama knew that his team examined the replacement.

Martin added that "Doubles Down" replied not in a final way to the knowledge question if the political polls had arrived on the office of Obama.

The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, appeared in January, it concocted a reissue of foreseen luxury for November 4, with several unpublished ones.
Four already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the publication of a new album of David Bowie had left stunned everyone.
The day of his 66E anniversary, January 8 2013, it had declared that a new album goes out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, dates back to 2003) and of too rare apparitions in public, the English musician proved that one again could count on him to let the pop scene sparkle.
A feast for its fans
Not tired of the surprises, David Bowie had more of a turn in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus foresaw to reprint this album, November 4.
For the occasion, it concocted a true feast for its fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day first rate, will present itself under the form of three discs: the original album, sessions studios unpublished and of the remix, as well as a DVD containing the four already unveiled pop videos.

And, especially, it gives one before taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a rock learnedly mastered electricity.
Unpublished already in listens
But Atomica is not the only title to unveil its charms.
The To Inform, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are them so available on the canvas.
The To Inform is at double face: a disturbing intro before a luminous stampede that slows down progressively to leave places to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to do a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, indeed even to Gravity?
With this cheerful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when it no longer has the feet on earth.
Space Oddity, side issue, was a lot does more engrave.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie done a new time reference to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enchanting, give envies to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun itself in any case to play chameleon with these titles: turn to turn informant, man on board of a rocket, Martian potential...
It conceals and reveals at once, plays to adopt different personalities, as it did it throughout his career, notably with its personages Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing of astonish to what it has therefore a mask to the hand in the photograph of the country THE Invitation to the Trip, brand Louis Vuitton, of which it embodies the new face.

Cogeco Cable fits together thus the step to its competitors, as Bell, even if the affiliate of Cogeco has not again date specifies in that has to do with this new plateforme.
"It is necessary to adapt himself and to change or to withstand the change and to fail", underlined Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which ones our customers do not have access currently.
The giant of the telecommunications Rogers already indicated that it could offer so certain Netflix technical details, that were not quoted, could be regulated.
To the United States, the popular service of said video to be in discussions with certain major câblodistributeurs so that his service is available through their broadcasting plateformes.
The p. p. -d.g. of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable equally greeted the announcement carried out by the government Harper at the time of his speech of the Holds court, October 16 last one.
Ottawa desires to force the television suppliers by cable and satellite to offer to the customers the possibility to pay the services to the card.
"That does almost two years and half that we say that the idea to force the consumers to buy important fixed prices of chains, that does not work", asserted Mr. Audet.
It hopes nevertheless that the consultations conducted by the Counsel of the broadcasting and Canadian telecommunications (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of framework of new reference to define our new political cultural Canadian one in that has to do with the television", said the p. p. -d.g. of Cogeco.
The CRTC takes consultations with the public since last week and they should continue with the in the spring next industry.
Side of the results, Cogeco indicated to have recorded a net profit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ by action.
It is a matter of a decline comparatively to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ by action, same period the last year.
The established business to Montreal explains this decline by costs of cushionings linked to new acquisitions.
Cogeco obtained in 2012 the câblodistributeur Atlantic Broadband, established to the United States, for 1.36 billions.
It was a matter of the first major acquisition of the business after the one that had failed to the Portugal.
In last December, the corporation montréalaise equally bought Peer 1 Network Businesses, a supplier Internet established to Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for the income of Cogeco, they knew a growth of 41.5% to the fourth quarter to attain 504.7 million.
They are of 1.8 billions for the financial exercise in course.
The net profit of his principal affiliate, Cogeco Cable, was of 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ by action, in decline in comparison with the 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ by action, same period the last year.
The income of Cogeco Cable nevertheless progressed of 45% to attain 470.4 million.
The business lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
Nevertheless, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is in raises 5546.
Mr. Audet does not worry to see the number of customers to fluctuate sort.
For me, this is not the indication of a change of tendency, it observed.
That varies of a quarter to the other with a very lively competition.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom declares that the gas pipeline of Bulgaria inaugurates a new era of the gas
The beginning of the construction of the gas pipeline South Stream in Bulgaria marks the launch of the one of the biggest energetic projects of Europe, declared the director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian party of the gas pipeline South Stream, the project on a large scale the most important of Europe", explained Alexei Miller, the general director of Gazprom, in a declaration Thursday.
This project is an element key of the energetic security of the body of the European continent.
South Stream should allow diversifying the ways of exportation of the Russia towards Europe.
A contractual disagreement between Gazprom and his counterpart of Ukraine, country by which passes through the biggest party of the Russian gas destined to Europe, increases the risk level in comparison with the conventional ways, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct junction towards Bulgaria, member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated to the countries of freezes are eliminated "for always".
The Bulgarian consumers receipts the gas of South Stream to a tariff reduces as soon as the body of the project will be put in service in 2015.

Unknown pull on a hotel close to the pyramids of Cairo
Of the unknown masked one opened the fire this Friday on a hotel close of the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without doing victims, consequence of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The assailants took the escape, specified the Spokesperson of the ministry of the Interior, the general of police Abdel Latif.
This attack arises while Egypt does not receive practically more any tourist since than the army discharged the Islamist president Mohamed Morsi at the beginning of July and represss in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
The schools are encouraged to concentrate more on the mathematical, the spelling and the grammar
In the framework of the courses of English literature, the students will have to study at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the XIXème century, a romantic poem and a fiction contemporary British work of 1914 to our days.
The examination will present equally of the "new texts" to encourage a more diversified reading.
A combining course literature and English language will be eliminated.
From 2015, the students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and strongly will be incited to choose a separated qualification in English literature.
The ministry of the Education must publish tomorrow its new programs of English and of maths – the first matters to undergo a radical revision.
It will proceed to changes in of other basic matters next years.
Besides, Ofqual, the regulating Office of the examinations, will unveil a remaniement of the structure of the GCSE, with a new system of notation and less than course.
Expressing itself during the summer, Michael Gove, minister of the Education, declared that there was a "wide consensus as for the need to reform our examination system to restore the confidence of the public", while insisting on the Fact that the GCSE would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more severe".
Studies show that the English schools consecrate less than time to the maths (116 hours per year, is 3 hours a week during the school year) that most of the other countries.
In comparison, the Australian schools propose in average 143 hours per year, and the students of Singapore about it do about 138 hours.
Although there is not any definite obligation to consecrate more hours of the job of the time to the maths, sources close of the government of coalition indicated that the GCSE of deepened maths – just like bigger importance granted to the matters figuring in international classifications – would encourage probably the schools to assure more hours of course.
The program will put more the accent on the "problems of the real world", notably the financial mathematical ones.
Is the European elite ready to do the matters with the Great Britain?
The country Business for Britain was launched in April with the promise to combine the businesses and to define what the creators of wealths and of jobs want to see changed in our relation with THE E.U.
For this to do, we ordered the investigation more wide and the does more complete with the British bosses of business and asked them this than they thought about the Great Britain, businesses and of THE E.U.
YouGov questioned more than 1 000 bosses of business, on the whole representative of all the sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for a lot.
We discovered that the vast majority of the businesses try henceforth export outside of Europe, while concentrating on the countries that modernize themselves and develop while the States of THE E.U. stagnate.
They want to see the government to give the priority to again commercial links with countries as China, India and Brazil rather than to get stuck in the long and difficult process reforms European institutional mysteries.
When one asks them their opinion on specific political points – going of the regulation of the monopolies to the laws on the products – the majority of the bosses of business think that the check of these competences keys should return to the hands of Westminster.
The unique market caused a general discontent, the said businesses that the cost of the regulation Brussels is disproportionate in comparison with the advantages that there is to be part of the zone of European exchanges – 40% of the big businesses, traditionally Most european most pro, are even agreed.
At last, and which is more speaking again, our investigation with the business bosses revealed that an important majority wanted to see the Great Britain to follow the initiatives in favor of a change of the treaty and development of a relation with THE E.U. based on the commerce and not the political one.
This conclusion, that meet again in all the big groups and the businesses of all sizes, shows that the world of the business insists for a "significant change" that gives again the strength to the United Kingdom.
The issues students – to succeed in change the treaty and more better to represent the interests of the Great Britain would allow seeing a swing of 16% of the votes in favor of the maintenance of the country in THE E.U. at the time of a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a single instant: this investigation shows that the British businesses support this aiming plan to renégocier the terms of the adhesion of the Great Britain to THE E.U.
She shows equally that the businesses hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of the strength in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and more and more necessary, of more better to represent the interests of the British businesses, since the Euro zone is involved itself in the way of an economical and fiscal union narrower.
The priority must be the job and the growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our investigation the watches, for the businesses that means to put again the accent on the commerce and a basic change of the statutory approach of Brussels.
Peking questions an Islamic movement turkmène

This movement often is designated by Chinese authorities as being responsible of the sporadic disturbances to the Xinjiang, but his real influence is questioned by several experts.

One is them so recognizing, each of them was absolutely tremendous.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: "One was afraid that she falls but she did not budge."
The firemen were great.

The Ukraine approaches the bankruptcy
The credit agency Standard & Poor's lowered Friday notes it creditworthiness of the Ukraine, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet republic, in recession since more of a year, to do facing its financial obligations.
The grade of the titles of public debt of the past country to "B-", sinking itself in the category of the speculative investments.
She is matching of a negative perspective, S&P visionary at least a luck on three that she is again lowered of here a year.
"It is of less in less probable than the strategy of the government allows guaranteeing sufficiently foreign mottos to do facing its exterior needs of financing students", explains the American agency.
The agency raises that the reserves of change of the Ukraine fell of 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and foresees that the tendency will continue.
That complicates the reimbursement of the credits take abroad.
These reserves, to which ones authorities have recourse massively to support the local change, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency judges more and more probable a devaluation, which would inflate his exterior debt.
Kiev needs besides liquidities to regulate its gas importations to Russia, that the not accused to have paid a bill of 882 millions of dollars.
This announcement constitutes a bad new one for the Ukrainian strength in a period of lively tensions with his Russian, furious neighbor of the will of Kiev to sign an association agreement with fine THE E.U. November.
She was rendered public to the day following the publication of official statistics showing that the economy of the country had undergone between July and September his fifth quarter of continuation of contraction.
His debt, again comparatively modest, exploded the latter years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of the PIB, against less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.
The country, in budget deficit, claims since months helps it international monetary Funds, that had granted him in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and some unblocked for the moment only 3.4 billions.
But the Funds refuses to pour any new slice as long as the country will not have adopted unpopular reformations to reduce his deficit, notably while increasing the prices of the gas to the population.
To the coming from a new fruitless mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important needs in exterior financing" constituted "a vulnerability", while raising "signs of economical improvement".
Nevertheless, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, Center of the political Etudes, "one cannot await an improvement in the short one run".
"There is few hope that of the unpopular reformations are launched in a pre-election year", the presidential elections being foreseen in 2015, raises the expert, questioned to the AFP.
The only hope, this is an improvement of international situation.
S&P raises in addition the" uncertainty" linked to the possible signature of an agreement of association between the Ukraine and THE E.U., that Brussels conditions to the liberation of the opposing Ioulia Timochenko.
"To sign the agreement would be positive for the commerce in the long term but there could be negative consequences to current and average terms linked to the reaction of Russia", explained S&P, that is afraid of the "commercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, that represents the quarter of the Ukrainian exportations, warned that in case of creation of a zone of free exchange between THE E.U. and Kiev, she should reinforce its checks to the border for the imported merchandise.
The lenders on pledge of Singapore profit from the average classes constraints to squeeze itself the belt
With a lender on pledge of the commercial center of Bendemeer to Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of buckles of ear in now to pay the expenses of schooling of its girls.
"My husband and me have just bought a house therefore all my money left inside", declares Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she wins 3 000 $ of Singapore (2 400 $) by months as administrator and that his husband works also, monthly family income does not suffice, she says.
Indeed, the request is such in certain parties of Asia of the southeast – where the debt of the households increases – that ValueMax, where she carried out his transaction, became this week the third corporation of ready ones on pledge to be introduced to the stock market of Singapore.
To put as a token of the jewels is not only a quick means to obtain from cash – 1 300 $ of Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but this is almost so good market as the ready not bank guarantee.
Usually, the lenders on pledge of Singapore remove an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offers by the United Overseas Bank, a local silent partner having a succursale in the same commercial center.
Nevertheless, the lenders on pledge have the advantage of not to ask verification of creditworthiness or of proof of salary, and can unblock the ready more quickly than the banks.
Consequently, millions of people through the region turn themselves towards the lenders on pledge while the families feel the pressure that exercises the increase of the cost of living and the excessive debt of the households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the world-wide financial crisis, and the credit inexpensive supplied by a too lax monetary policy in the advanced economies, the families to weak and average income turn themselves towards the lenders on pledge to fill the difference while their known economies a slowdown.
This week, the credit agency Standard & Poor's quoted the growing debt of the households, principally resulting of the increase of the ready hypothécaires, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of the Asian banks.
She declared that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded ratio debt of the internal the highest crude households/produces of Asia.
Malaysia arrives in list head with 80% of the PIB, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
The economists fear equally the high level of debt of the consumers in Thailand, that went out of little this week of a technical recession.
Thursday, data showed a weakness continues exportations and a slowdown of the request of the consumers.
"The report is that with the increase of the costs, the people in the middle or to the bottom [ladder of the salaries] try complete their income as they are able", declares Song Seng Wun, economist with CIMB, a bank malaisienne.
The historically high prices of the gold during the two last years did that the people hurried themselves to put as a security their personal effects to touch the value in cash of their jewels.
To Singapore, about 70% of the items put as a security in the 200 shops of ready one on pledge of the city state are in now.
The said people, "the price of gold student, let's put as a security the chain in now of grandmother and one will return to look for it next months".
In Thailand, the biggest operator of shops of ready one on pledge, EasyMoney, recorded an increase of 20% of the number of customers using its shops during the last months.
The increase is such in the sector of the ready one on pledge that ValueMax, operator of the shop to Bendemeer and of 15 other shops as this one to Singapore, foresees to develop not only in Malaysia neighbors – where it already counts four shops – but equally outside of Asia, declares Yeah The Ching, his general director.
The corporation will finance them while using 60% of the 66 M$ of Singapore that she raised this week at the time of his introduction to the stock market of Singapore.
While certain lenders to reduced rate wiped the critics for the exorbitant interest rate that they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that the placement as a security offers not only rates less high than the other lenders, but that what's more she increases not directly the debt.
"The customers mortgage of the although they already possess, and the fact to monetize their personal goods does not increase the debt of the households", she says.
The placement as a security is of better some more better accepted socially as means to obtain a guaranteed financing in the short one run.
The people that go with the lenders on pledge are not not more only those that have financial problems.
The easy people of Singapore go equally in the shops of ready one on pledge ValueMax to put as a token of the ingots of now or watches Rolex, that can represent until 60% of their price of purchase in cash.
We see customers of all the put to bed corporation.
"This can be easy people that need to borrow in the short one run for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have needs of funds to pass a difficult cape", adds Miss Yeah.
Sometimes, they have just need of money very quickly.

The police officials spotted Sarborough, 32 years, in the process of depositing three bags of cocaine to the residence of the lawyer to Blackburn, in the Lancashire, while it attended a dinner of the Bar with colleagues.
The investigations revealed that Ditta was an "uniform consumer" of this drug of class A after that of the tests showed tracks of cocaine in its hair, on his wallet and its credit cards.
On a period of eight months between January and August 2011, it tried obtain in an illicit way the news on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough as well as the one of its associates.
The four suspicious ones were overseen to the era by the police in the framework of an important investigation on an illegal dealings in heroin and of cocaine unfolding itself in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they afterward were imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M£, as well as more than 200 000£in cash during a raid series.
Ditta, 42 years, furnished the news to the criminals for it feared that his toxicomanie is not revealed to the big day.

It impeded the investigation of the police as much as it was able for him to allow following its criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not a credit to his profession, but disgraced it.
It too came close to himself certain customers, in particular Scarborough, and it left to compromise his independence.

But after the audience, the superintendant The Halstead of the Police of the Lancashire declared: "Mr. Ditta is passed lawyer pénaliste to criminal himself from that time that it began obtaining itself drug with criminal organizations."
His addiction to the cocaine compromised it forever and rendered vulnerable it to the ulterior motives of the members leaders of the criminal organized groups that it in charge of obtaining from precious the news concerning investigations of police.
The lawyers should observe the integrity rules the strictest ones and establish a confidence climate with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and attempt to shelter itself behind the varnish of his profession.

What this matter uses warning to the criminals for that they know that no one is above the law.
We will be located and you will translate in front of the courts.

A difficult year for the pharmacists
The departure closely of 10 pharmacists to the Center of health and social services (CSSS) of Laval caused all an emotion to the direction of the Hospital of the Cité-de-la-Santé, and this, at the time of the year 2012-2013.
Because of multiples departures to the retirement, of vacations of maternity or of departures any current, the pharmacy department was located strongly loss-making in personnel.
It lacked close to 30% of the effective necessary one, returning this financial year "very difficult", according to the boss of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
Nevertheless, the CSSS decided of not to engage independent manpower, that can cost until three dearer time than an engaged one on time full pharmacist.
One did not have recourse to the repairs, explained Mrs Beaudet.
One rationalized or certain diminished of our activities inside the establishment for bearing, the time that the things replace themselves.
It is sure that one worked strong to interest our young ones [residents in pharmacy] for that they come and remain here.
There is a circumstance competition that did that one was in a bad position the past year.
Improved position
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 announces themselves clearly easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are return to the work after their vacation of maternity and three other pharmacists were hired during the last months.
Of more, the efforts deployed by the department in order to keep carried fruit, for the four students presently in residence to Laval equally decided to remain at the job of the CSSS.
Now, that goes a lot better, underlined the pharmacist.
Of here the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.
That will come therefore to fill our departures of the past year.
Always growing needs
The position remains nevertheless delicate.
Several factors, as the scarcity of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the trade, return positions such as the one lived in 2012 difficult ones to foresee.
For us [the number of effective ones] always is precarious, for one has an environment that is young and one employs a lot of young women, therefore with pregnancies, one rolls almost always to three vacations of maternity when that goes well, she added.
The last year, one in had a lot more and one does not have any pharmacists that are available to do the replacements, therefore it was more difficult.

Anger provoked by the pronounced penalty in opposition to one of the posers of bomb of Bali
The survivors and the close ones of the 202 killed people in the attempts of Bali in 2002 reacted with anger to the pronounced penalty in opposition to the last one conspirators to be translated in justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a small ball of execution.
Patek, that passed almost 10 years in escape while being the one of the men the done more look for Asia of the southeast, yesterday was condemned to a penalty of 20 years of prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosive vehicles used at the time of the attempts.
It could be liberated after 15 years under conditional liberation.
The man of 45 years was recognized guilty killings of mass for the attempts aiming two nightclubs in the popular tourist neighborhood of Kuta, that caused the death of 202 people, of which 88 Australians, and did many injureds.
It was equally recognized guilty many other bosses of accusation in relation with the terrorism, notably a wave of attempts aiming churches in all the Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors asked an imprisonment penalty for life, nevertheless they could have asked what the man, qualified of "Demolition Man" for his reputation of expert in bomb manufacture, is condemned to death.

Mr. Hugues declared that Patek should have known the same goes out that the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible of the slaughter – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – that were executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been condemned to death before the others.
To keep it in life, why, there is not any reason to keep it in life.
Pass 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others, this is not a lot.
Patek is the last one posers of bomb of Bali to be translated in justice.
It had succeeded avoiding doing itself to capture during almost 10 years but finally was stopped in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former boss of Al-qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the process, an agent of the FBI declared that of the reports of the services of piece of information had revealed that Patek was at the Pakistan to meet Bin LADEN with the intention of to reestablish links between the terrorist groups of Asia of the southeast and Al-qaeda.
"It did not return", added Mrs Corteen.
Until recently, it made fun of frantically of the sorrow that it had been able to cause to other people.
The verdict was returned on the eve of the 10E anniversary of the attempts that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies to Bali and in Australia.
"There will be a lot of pleurs this year", said Mrs Corteen.
Patek nevertheless can appeal his condemnation.

Mess around the closing of the urgencies of the hotel god
Facing satirizes it conducted for several months by a part of the personnel and several unions, of which the CGT, the minister of health, Marisol Touraine, had decided July 10 of "to shift the calendar of implement project, and in particular the date back to closing of the urgencies that will not be able to intervene November 4".
An officially done request "not to run any risk on the taken in charge of the urgencies to Paris at first of the winter" but that aimed also to not to bother the country of the PS to some months of the municipal ones.
Despite record them ministerial, the closing anyway should be effective to this date.
Even if, to the APHP, one prefers to employ the term of "transformation" or of "change in the continuity".
As of November 4, the that assured about a quarter of the 40 000 annual passages to the urgencies of the hotel god any receipt for records to take the about thirty of case engrave a day towards the urgencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date back to November 4 corresponds equally to the renewal of the internats.
To the Hotel God, the internal specialized ones in urgencies will leave places Monday to five internal ones of general medicine.
As for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine, it is programed for the current of the months.
"The service of welcome of the urgencies of the hotel god must close in the briefest delay, and for us, it is November 4", assures without detour Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) APHP, that supports the project of the direction.
"November 4, there will be no longer any patients affable by the firemen, only people coming by their own means", confirms Professor John yves Fagon, the medical person in charge of the new Hotel God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in urgency", it tempers, emphasizing the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR on the spot to transfer the cases engrave.
Doctors emergency physicians senior will remain on the spot, it assures equally.
But it is at the ARS that it belongs to decide the closing of the service of welcome of the urgencies.
"The things do themselves progressively", replies Nicolas Péju, spokesperson of the ARS for that, November 4, "there will be not change in terms of returned service."
"The minister lied us or one lied him", deplores the doctor emergency physician Gérald Kierzek.
Dislocated of his post of boss of the SMUR at the beginning of July to have taken satirizes it against the reorganization project, it defines himself as an "alarm promoter" facing a decision "cynical" taken by "the administrative medical technostructure".
"They are emptying and to suffocate urgencies that were renovated there is less than five years", it estimates.
For him, "if the other services of Parisian urgencies could absorb the surplus, there would be not problem".
Now they uniformly are clogged.
There is for example sometimes nine hours of expectation to the urgencies of Lariboisière.
To the ARS, one argues that thirty patients "dispatchés" on several sites do not risk representing an "avalanche" in the other services of urgencies, of which the human means will have besides summers reinforced.
To the ARS as to the APHP, one defends the "new hospital model" already put in road since October 7 and that should continue to welcome 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
Of here at the end of the year, liberal nonspecialized doctors should equally come to participate in set it up of a "permanence of outpatient cares".
"Where one goes if one asks the people of itself car to diagnose", wonders Gérald Kierzek for that "the urgency concept does not engrave" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
That will happen as for level maternities 3.
The people are not crazy, they will go there where there is the better offer of cares.
If the minister does not take any measure of here Monday, we will change gear ratio, warns Christophe Prudhomme, doctor emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even present in the framework of the municipal country and we will reflect to present a list.
In the team of Nathalie kosciusko-morizet, Vincent Roger, counsel UMP of Paris and elected of the 4E district, announces clearly that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the urgencies to the Hotel God, this would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if one comes back to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the candidate PS, has as for her again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had pronounced herself in favor of a moratorium for that there is not closing November 4.
If it was the case, she would mark his net disagreement, underlines Bruno Julliard, his spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the hotel god has his legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable outline of continuation towards the other hospitals.

"Doubtless between 120 and 150 million all confused countries", it advanced in last March.
His cat birman on the knees, in the parlor of his immense apartment of a building of the avenue Foch to two steps of the Arch of Triumph, the mischievous eye under its white hair, it quoted some one of the languages in which ones the adventures of HIS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.

The father of HIS said "to do a kind of geopolitical serial".
"I am in permanence my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before leaving", added Gérard of Villiers.

Certain women are sexual objects in my books but of others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I always am well welcomed in Africa where I count very numerous readers.
