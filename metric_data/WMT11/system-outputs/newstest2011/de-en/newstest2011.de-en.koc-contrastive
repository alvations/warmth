What can you do to the ČSSD? the Czech social democrats in Prague are not aware of voldemort, nor the "konditorei."
The new ratsherren of capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers must be overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the Czech ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung understand at all.
The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the ČSSD time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has established, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm.
The codierte vocabulary, which in the long era of mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite has been introduced, is some of the best-known actors, situations and borrowed causae.
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new notions of somewhat in the dark.
The claim they at least.
"who is voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš kaucký, of the new town councillor from on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes."
But also the town councillor from Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way.
For example, at the term "golfloch."
"This is the only expression of which they are submitting me, which I am now and again."
"otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang."
From the vocabulary of the aktuálně.cz tageblatt, in June this year before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial was published pickte six words, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should the concepts of 'voldemort,' 'biggest Prague golfloch, "" in the konditorei go', "stiernacken," the capital of "betrayal" and "verblechen define."
Three of the Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the conversation, but not even the listeners.
The fifth, town councillor from Petr dolínek, rejected the test.
"These are things I do and as the Civic Democrats talk about each other, I passed."
"for me, it is important, as we understand, within the framework of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, would have Lukáš kaucký in the aforementioned headline allegedly failed to understand that the influential businessman and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek.
The term "voldemort" says kaucky absolutely nothing and the only one he had on the test erriet correctly, was "the greatest Prague golfloch."
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to safety but still added: "But I know this from the newspaper instead."
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show."
The "golfloch" will then not just of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the environment Lukáš plachý right as blanka entziffert tunnel.
Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term voldemort and Lukáš plachý senses even where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in the konditorei to go."
"I believe that that is, in any company in Prague to go," plachý is pretty close to solving the conundrum hit, when we know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms.
In keeping with Březina, he asserted, but rather this knowledge from the newspaper to have drawn, as this would embrace that language.
The testteilnehmern, judging by the Social Democrats, in fact, it seems no similar slang habit.
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really not."
"We call upon us in the name of, and again we use also acronym or nickname of," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr hulínský - by his own party who put "hulda."
"at school I was bříza (birch), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues too," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has pioneered the names and lo and behold, it works.
Town councillor from weinert is for the party of "friendly" OPA or less friendly to the "old," the representative, Miroslav poche, before the elections, with operations in the partei-sponsoring on, will be made by some colleagues' igráček " (well-known Czech lego-figur).
Nicknames are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in the intra-party vocabulary.
It may not hulínský allegedly, if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker of Prague chairman.
His spitzname 'doctor who allegedly gummiknüppel-rechte "has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský his juris doctor title to the bratislaver police academy has acquired.
The government wants the torture of "witch" and gave out a brochure
Women in Burkina Faso to be labelled witches, usually some common social features.
They include more of the older generation, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are constraint and have no children.
If one of these women to hexe 'will', it is strictly isolated, so that the rest of the village not can be dangerous.
"men are from this fate right rarely affected."
"even young and healthy women remains, since this will save you at work and help to bear children," a ordensschwester describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a spezialheim by more than a hundred women attending from their communities were emitted.
The ortsregierung now decided against this sozialmaßnahme "abnormal."
And for this reason, there was a pamphlet, by the "stop."
The matter has, however, a catch.
"more than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper derstandard "to the dilemma of the written information.
To be accused of witchcraft, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, was; so did the ammy hemmahová of three women and two men have been tortured to death - they übergossen you with petroleum and simply burned.
On this incident reported, including the BBC servers.
The perpetrators claimed, however, the matter would be only a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version is oil, to salbungen inflamed the ritual will be used.
And that, after the group had sought, "an evil spirit" of the woman "wrongs."
The isolation of "witch" support the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneurs from Burkina Faso," fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat today, "he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso has at least tried to defuse the witch hunt, the gambianische President last year, the President himself mitgemischt properly.
"President yahya jammeh revolt after the death of his aunt, a monstrous witch-hunt, since these supposedly share of whose death and would have had to try, even the President himself by black magic killing people."
"He called schamane from the middle of Guinea to aid, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the bodyguard of the President of randomly prisoner, women and men kidnapped and forcibly taken from gambianischen villages on the farm of the President in kanilai expressed," led the organisation Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm were forced from prison, a absud from plants with halluzinogener effect to drink, but also the bowel and nierenprobleme applause.
Two of the arretierten people survived the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners have been released.
A tenant of bakala: he revives in the kiln, yet pays higher rent
An older untersetzter man just out of the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, the largest privatbesitzers choose from in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm of a file, with three new rental homes to three: on its own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who had just served a prison sentence.
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" has just increased the rent.
Instead of 3,500 kronor monatsmiete is the son of the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with kitchen fork out the second category 4100 crowns.
"and because there is not a fluent in the apartment once hot water and heating it must be in a simple kohleofen," if he angered the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing a power he has.
"But what I have signed," said he was upset and half resigned itself.
Bytyokd.cz 's citizens' Association, the new mietbedingungen as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts is simply not to sign and to wait until 7 December, at which it intends to publish guidance as you against such contracts.
But the man only beckons.
"A says this, the other the," he is a benighted face.
The region is so great, "the Ostrava deregulierungslabor."
After new year is this deregulation most choose in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants has not market-oriented pay rent.
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" to visit personally.
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine a.m. on this Tuesday packed full.
Just beside the door, the bodyguards of a safety agency and in its a aufrufgerät.
"rent" in 2011, so is a special tastfeld on the front.
And briefly touched upon this already spuckt the device from a nummernzettel.
We hardly have the number "157" entziffert and piepst they already on the large display on the ceiling of the warteraums.
Half a second later, one of the series.
A little later an old couple enters the waiting room, after the rent on issues, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent.
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - reparaturanträge, insurance and so forth.
Mid November fly in the region of Ostrava, the kuverts with the new rental most tenants out of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of the rpg in the letter boxes.
The rpg byty proposes them in the letter, a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38%.
The special switch to the new rent is in klientenzentrum since the 18 November.
"The action is in a little over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning," answers the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, when the "client" turns as a journalist.
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections from the Ostrava, Deputy Lubomír zaorálek of the ČSSD this issue fairly roared up, it is no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"twenty years I want from you a new floor."
"not even ne besch. Wc-brille could change it," the man said at the outset.
Until now, according to the staff, above all, to pensioners on counters, in order to convince them, whether they really mietermäßigung promised them rpg promises, if they spezialangebot sign in time.
Enjoy a half reduced februarmiete should the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign.
Until now, is "deregulierungsschalter" in havířov but anything other than of enquiries overloaded.
"from yesterday " s 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this," the schalterbeamtinnen estimate.
Rpg offers both on their websites, as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary.
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent for some, they will be set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information is about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach to understand rpg," said on its web sites.
"here, no one goes to court," says one of the staff of byty rpg and a man in the street before the klientenzentrum gives it at least partly right.
"I have more than 13,000 (kronor) pension, I remain convinced of 5,000 to eating left, where should I put the money for a gerichtsstreit coming from," he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
"time."
"Mr zaorálek tells you about the media, they should not sign, and so are the people still," there are concerns, too.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic and rpg byty demonstrated in 2011, according to the mieterhöhung is an economic necessity.
"the existing level of rents is not enough time for the maintenance of the wohnfonds from," argues Pavel klimeš, director of the wohnungs-portfolios society and rpg byty - particularly those of the supplement tenants criticised wohnungsfonds is neglecting the opinion of the homeowners as the main reason for the mieterhöhung.
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion to invest in the homes, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
On the großformatigen lcd-display on the ceiling to the polstersesseln in the waiting room of havířov once in a while there are always a few red shining information on.
"The mieterhöhungen in 2011 by 15%, and less concern 31 200 homes, that means more than 90% of the homes of rpg."
"It always means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square metre and month," is on the lcd-monitor to read.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg increased the rent by 38 percent.
"in these cases, there is the increase in extremely low rental charges of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argues rpg.
At 2600 homes remains the rent for the next year the same amount.
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rents not exploded, but gradually within four and eight years.
What is more, the company a further obligation imposed on: all revenue from the mieterhöhung (see diagram) wants the businesses back into their homes, especially in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the insulation.
But are these people - and especially those who benefit from the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
The architects saw a - the office is also a nursery
The office building avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company arch.design.
But who would have expected a minikindergarten here, with all entails: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse.
This nursery is since last year, the staff of arch.design available.
The projektierungs- and architekturbüro arch.design, whose ateliers a whole series of prominent brünner buildings, are expected from the first drafts for the new building avriopoint to with the rooms for its firmen-minikindergarten.
In wise, because most of his 90 staff (internal) are in the babyboom-alter and the firm is keen that the projektantinnen and architektinnen as quickly as possible to return to their jobs.
Together with the possibility of shortened to work, the nursery is a further bonus, the arch.design its employees in the concept of their sozialprogrammes has to offer.
The bauingenieurinnen and -architektinnen have made it so make it easier for their challenging work and child care to reconcile.
The minikindergarten is an original idea, the staff (internal) of arch.design and with the support of management, managed them financial assistance from the European Union and the Department for work and Social Affairs for their project to win.
The occupational minikindergarten is due to the operationsprogramm human resources and employment policy from the budget of the European Social Fund and from the state of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants in excess of 2, 8 million CZK) allowed the necessary facilities and equipment and be obtained for the duration of 2 years is for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the absorption of funding (2 years), the society arch.design obliged, the minikindergarten 3 more years at their own cost.
The preparation of this project, a whole year, and the society economy rating in the antragsabwicklung active assistance.
For the children is ganztätig qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin, the nursery school children can visit altersmäßige without restrictions, though most of them over three years old.
And since it is a mini-kindergarten, allowed only five children at the same time, however, be present alternate the day on several children from each other.
The kindergartenbetrieb is flexible to the need of the parents, the children of all the staff have in relation to the use of the kindergartens have the same rights, without regard to the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, is the programminhalt in mini-kindergarten nevertheless comparable with the framework programme of the pre-school education.
The children play not only here, in particular will offer excellent teaching - of basic knowledge to the vorschulunterricht, incidentally, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative play, but also equipped with a computer, of the children is available.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive firmenmilieu.
Parents can always look to the children and then throw away the stress of the late to collect the children from a remote nursery.
The parents use their working hours is therefore more productive.
No surprise, then, that this is also natural and loyal labour relations.
Arch.design included so under the Czech firms, which in the recruitment of new staff to offer significant benefits ," which are family-friendly and through such programs to encourage their recruitment marketing.
A knochenhaus fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interieure of Gaudi to
The roof seems to like the back of a prehistoric echse, climbing the stairs as the spine of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler.
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants of this House, with its organic forms the nickname of "knochenhaus."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and mosaic, which is seeking to shed façades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the House is playing with beautiful lines, colors and texturen lack force of nature and living things.
Only on closer inspection, they noticed that all of geometry, rhythm and ill thought-out order dominated.
In the middle of the night, the whole facade is still plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung enhances the splendour of the colours.
The same schwungvollen lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House.
Geformtes Parliament spouting out waves of wood being copied the window frames, geländer, zierelemente by doors, even gucklöcher and afford.
The House in the eixample quarter batlló on a busy shopping road passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the renovation of a house from the years of 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese said.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea of gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper to reconstruction.
The mietshaus Casa batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone.
He was working with the architect Josep Maria jujol together.
Just on the drawing board established the rhetorical flourishes for representative apartment of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaics of the facade was his idea.
In the shape of the facade was working but also many other bildner and artists.
The joint work of the drafts of the Casa batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí.
So jujol also participated in the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in park güell, which also further works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nickname of "knochenhaus."
Others described it as the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning House."
It also says to the top of the building is the sword of St George, of the existence of Catalonia.
But other elements of bildhauerische symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí outlined for the House for the time zentralheizungssystem unique with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen.
Seems a little bizarre to her 45-grad-neigung already.
In his create Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and had no way of this.
Before the start of construction - although he studios, the city of the appropriate planning permission but one which it claims to be made on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later at the completion of so horrified by the result has been that they demanded redress.
The ratsherren breathed among other things, that the building, with its pillars: even in the public sidewalk intervention.
It was not to make changes, however, quite the opposite - only 15 days after the call on the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request to approve the renting of two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and it was promptly gave him.
The homeowners themselves drew in the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and privaträume the apartment.
The ground floor was taken to a juweliergeschäft that are allowed to be leased.
The entire sechsstöckige buildings is going through a ladder up to the dachterrasse.
With the main elements of the redevelopments have all been right corner and precise lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces.
The social part is explained by the opening up of the salontüren completely combine and so could a larger society, without chatting comfortably in vertraulicheren talks to a certain degree of intimacy.
The House was given by gaudís refitting except a new facade and a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
Also impressive is gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten kacheln, with whom the courtyard is dressed and the lichthöfe.
The game gives these two colours all floors of the House a maximum amount of light.
While he made simply to use the principle that knows better reflect the light, as a dark colors, contrary to absorb sunlight.
The House, Casa batlló in 2005 in the welterbe-liste UNESCO was included, I can now visit everyone.
In the first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste apartment made available to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the years to this step and that on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator.
As you pointed out that this is a very profitable business activities, is thriving in the surveys, one they also extended to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse.
The price for the inspection of the preserve an however is no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get reductions of 20 per cent.
This figure dwarfs the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city.
Whoever the real atmosphere of the House with his drachentürmchen know wants to learn should try, friendship with one of the inhabitants and to close to visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - mattress and rost make the good bed.
These must, however, harmony, in order to supplement the wishes of the specific user.
In selecting the many things to play a role - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the schläfers.
Just as important is the interieur where mattress and subordinate rost.
Typical example?
In a wochenendhaus, in which no heated on a regular basis, latexmatratzen are not well suited to much longer because they need in order to "warm."
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen.
And, they should be turned on a regular basis.
If it is not enough entlüftungskanälchen in the core and have yet to have a solid record, staut humidity in itself: it is not therefore ruled that under their mould will.
In the election, of course, also plays a role, to which it is used.
Those long periods of time was abroad, where very high with mattresses weichschicht fare, will be difficult to a low mattress with hard surface can get.
"probably all hockey players, who are stuck in the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly."
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hüften they need just a weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam, a formgedächtnis-polymer)."
"This, I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the" information "from the gelenken and the skin can receive bad," said hadamcziková Sylva, which specializes in polstermöbel.
That is why I have many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses with visco-schaum (memory foam) concerned.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, since such mattresses provide the tempur among manufacturers, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico."
And one need not be a famous hockey players for the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is schmiegt on warm body.
Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts we are not as around after a major battle.
You simply sleep much better.
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene).
The election of the matratzengröße you should still be at the height of the length of the fußsohlen add is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
As Mrs Mann, of the 180 cm in size, need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the schläfer ought to be at least 90 cm liegebreite available, so together 180 cm.
In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 cm.
For the comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you take on the backs of lies, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," ing advises. Prokopová Helena, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has for many years the issue of common sense and makes the ergonomics of furniture is dedicated to this issue and at university.
In a doppelbett everyone needs a home and his own mattress, but be careful when buying products, so that the mattresses are too high.
Otherwise there is nothing, as the roste variations in assembling and that is not in any bettrahmen possible.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with federskelett 15 cm, ought to be at least three centimetres in the formschicht and the feinpolster alone.
"with the hand or sit down, we must in any case, feel the feathers," warns prokopová Helena.
Each mattress makes a special rosttyp needed.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with bed and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to look in the bedroom.
These mattresses are not to reveal the terms and you cannot wash today, which already is.
And because you are in a single night between 0.2% to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years to a huge (and congested sieve).
This is also why reject werbeslogans specialists, the mattresses in a lifespan of up to 25 years, and yes even lifelong guarantee promises.
Every cause has its if and buts.
And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide should the hygiene of the waschbaren, abziehbaren remuneration should not be afraid, however, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, you have to leave and can easily wash.
Even if today, in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss produced after the open, so that you get two halves (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), looks the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially just pointed out, often as the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Have you in bed instead of a rostes a fixed panel?
Out with it.
Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night.
Even so, you should be preferred to the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight (if not in there already are) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm floor with so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use.
Polyurethan-matratzen belong on such a document is not.
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly even combinations of latex and kokos), always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate.
On verstellbare lamellenroste include no mattresses with federskelett, since they are not on the ergonomische verstellung respond.
In addition to the suspension of the stiff the federleisten will also be special flexible schultermodule.
There is a specific integration of the federleisten, enabling the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, that it is the odd einsinken the shoulder of the schläfers.
Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter.
There are even matratzenhersteller have started, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich to use.
Also in the ladies is - you guessed it takes these weichzonen in the hüftgegend.
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed at several points, and thereby reduce the tension.
But, if you are on the right mattress and right rost a bad (too big and fülliges) kopfkissen, used to go to most of the gains will be lost.
Here too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is the head, his tips should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the seitenlage should be the kopfkissen (along with the schulterentlastungszone rost or in the weichzone in the bed of the schulterhöhe).
Rather, our modern mattresses, with the former (with hay festive) strohsäcken but in common.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also in the new magic formula mattresses "organic."
Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen frequent naturelle oils - for example, rizinus- and soya oil.
Soya is known to be used by all manufacturers.
"organic is, in other words, the mattresses at its heart from materials purely natural origin, there is," said Petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus.
Naturstoffe but they are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera.
We can but also mikrokapseln, sleep in the fresh woodland or lavendelduft.
Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman.
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern used so that the matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain in the blood, the weaker sex will sleep in the wohlig warm words.
And the current favorites?
Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethan and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the various stiff (force) of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise, the know exactly where head, hip and heels.
For a high-end mattress is 7,000 crowns and to fork out more.
Gesundheitsmatratzen are, however, usually with a lower value added tax, since you, as a medical tool.
As the first Czech companies were gumotex this advantage.
You see, on the bed and on rost save is not so easy.
And again there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of an offer.
The brand magniflex the mattress duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free to do so.
It was the tempur material, that the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace.
Not surprisingly, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts at the launch of enormous überbelastungen.
Tempur will warm soft, in a cool place, in turn, reinforces it.
So it fits perfectly in the human body and spread over the best way körperdruck.
It is therefore not just ideal for the prevention of druckbrand, but increased the schlafkomfort generally.
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but they are not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used the legs and the gefäßen relief are laid down.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte, in order to control the youngsters have
The fear for their own children grow, and as always, they consider more parents to monitor via GPS.
The system, which was originally to searching for cars was invented, is as good as people, places, and in such cases would be helpful, as recently in the spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year anička janatková.
The device is currently about as large as a packet of but soon, there should be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the missing anička in fear and so they were looking at ways and means, to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an encroachment on their privacy.
"We are all, to say that this is by no means herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to tragedy," Petr pilin of society because of macro, one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in response to the abuse of such devices can be, for example, if there is someone in the pocket, without knowing about it, but so far we have had no such case."
"most customers are really buy it for security reasons," adds pilin added.
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency.
The kinderpsychologin Dana bočková has, however, suggest that a child, if there is such a thing, it may not bear its simply be dumped.
"even very young children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"The phones were initially awoke to the parents of high expectations, but they can be just as easy as closure, this new überwachungsgeräte," says Mrs bočková.
Your opinion is also controversial, if such a body in the event of an attack is actually helps.
"on a planned abduction, the kidnappers almost always checked whether the child in any electronics, with which it could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such überwachungsgeräte were wider use, they would also seek them, because their sale sure would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"in these cases the police are the criminals are always a step ahead," says psychologist.
But it removes a similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful.
Roberta čech by society, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen RC monitoring, both for cars, as well as for people who can offer the existence of such an appliance and then help, if it immediately after the attack will be destroyed.
"The device is so that it is exploring the respective positions in certain intervals."
"even if it would immediately destroyed, at least, is the final position of the person concerned available."
"with more expensive devices is even a neigungsmesser integrated, that is, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos breaks down, the machine immediately sends a warning to the position," claims Mr čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also intelligent mobile phones with navigation perform, you only have a special software einzuspielen.
The problem with the current positioning is that this is either about equipment in streichholzschachtel-größe, resemble the supporters or smaller mobile phones.
So there is always the risk that they will lose.
Mr pilin of the macro because tests, according to you, therefore, in the present devices, which look like normal digitaluhren.
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers do not realise that there is a monitoring and localisation device.
"or he notices that only after a certain time in what the police are a zeitvorsprung," he added.
Regardless of the direction in which development is - towards armbändern or trailers, always will be the same technology, such as the fahrzeugortung.
Therefore, the combination of ortungsfunktion through the gps-systems (just like the MS in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which is the current position.
The army has so many scheme that it is the Czech Republic umwickeln could keep them but only two years.
The Czech army has 445 kilometres bought with explosives scheme, to be released.
In the year earlier, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles but delivered to the double.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the scheme - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the scheme from the company stv group, A. S. for paltry 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount but said of the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would be on the 60 kilometres per year but are using.
The calculations of armeepyrotechnikern, mf dnes, according to the point raised in this indication is that the whole army, each year, an intensive training course pyrotechnic should - of all the generals and commanders of the armeekommandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil picek is no exception.
Only in this way can be of considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres zündschnüren more or less justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonationen.
But even so, this would armeebestände for more than ten years.
But if even the old rule of experts is that the training of every new professional two metres but are quite sufficient, then the army with this neueinkäufe - from the point of view of the increased needs of key units - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned 225 years created.
It complained the soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently with the Defense Minister Vondra, you would have had almost no cartridges for small arms register more, so that the lack of resources because of freedom are greatly restricted.
The unterhosenmangel.
"to me is not why they are such huge sums to buy" scheme.
But it is ultimately their decision, you will already know, what they need. "
"for us, the army is a good customer, we as traders largely want to come forward," says the vertriebsmanager the stv group děcký Jan.
Jan pejšek, the spokesman for the Department of Defense based on the purchase of hundreds of kilometres, but so that the army would have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" members.
Jan děcký of the stv group but talks only of a four-year gebrauchsdauer the scheme and police and armeepyrotechniker even only from two years ago.
"in perfect storage are probably also mentioned the four years of possible," one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not as a soldier of the criticism of the army to be accused of.
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer must thoroughly any ammunition to be tested whether they still is reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk.
But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
A further argument of the Defense Department is the mengenrabatt for 445 kilometres but.
"It cost us 60 percent less than the last delivery of 244 miles," spokesman pejšek tells us the position of purchasers might arise with the Department of Defense.
Just by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of pyrotechnikern of the police, the munitions from the second world war or the Soviet bruderarmee liquidate exceeds, already some years barely 1,500 metres.
And the police always appointed only such amounts of ammunition it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume.
The safety of the pyrotechniker, moreover, because we are so the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable scheme open.
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the winding up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from times of Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak army in their campaign to the Rhine.
The pyrotechnikern, according to the mf dnes, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years ago, the same problem with the elimination of hundreds of kilometres of old scheme, which they now as "good" has bought.
Up until now I have the contacts that I have won the competition thanks to
The victorious placement in competition "small businessman of the year," Lukáš pytloun sale of the franchise helped his hotels.
Winners of the last jahrganges of competition "small businessman of the year" Lukáš pytloun from was carried out by Liberec.
The story of his success has come as a filmszenarium.
Lukáš pytloun traveled to do.
Only abroad he was aware that it is in wondering how they carried out by Liberec of good at reasonable prices.
From the savings from its ferienarbeiten abroad and with the help of a bank, it emerged a baufälliges House with five homes.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth term, this was certainly a daunting.
"The preis-qualität-verhältnis angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte apartment he rented to auslandsarbeiter.
The entire profit he immediately invested back into the House, which he then step for step towards pension with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then, it managed in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity carried out by Liberec in four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds to open all unterkunftskategorien.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the viersternehotel "pytloun design hotel."
In this year was another first-class hotel added.
"We just have a contract with a hotel in ostrov U tisé signed, we have sold our franchise-konzept and other interested parties on the franchise pytloun-hotels have already been reported," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"a large proportion of this lizenzverkauf at the behest of hotels have just had the victory in the competition," entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr pytloun acknowledged added.
The victory gave him greater prominence and popularity, carried out by Liberec in and around.
"The people saw me on the street, often even congratulated me afterwards and I must say that the fact right well," he recalls.
I really recommend to all who want to create something, to participate in this competition.
We also need not just to gain any visible is a good thing.
He says that he has, to date, from the contacts and acquaintances benefits to which they would otherwise not be at all.
"with people who, thanks to the competition, I have met, I hold regular business until today."
With the success of the glory of his opinion, is also a little on any of its staff.
And since he has to the seventy.
"When I see them greater loyalty and proud that they are part of something, the general recognition."
I see this really is not just as a personal success, but no, it is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is only a little in the forefront," says Lukáš pytloun modest.
I wish my successors an even a year ago, when we had it in farmet
The euphoria of victory for was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination farmet has the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone firm of the year last year, Karel žďárský, company owners of farmet.
The jury then acknowledged the effort, with whom he is from the small werkzeugbau in Česká skalice a company from the ground, the improvised parliamentary hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this recognition not only myself but also encouraged all my staff and our self-confidence in the fight with the competition has encouraged," says the vorjahresgewinner.
At the beginning of the firmengeschichte of farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state his father Karel žďárský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists as a small workshop offered to lease, he had not hesitated for a long time, his career in the company, in the meantime, he was busy ditch and founded with a few friends of his father, a separate company for the manufacture of plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on pflanzenölpressen.
Within 18 years ago, they are the largest manufacturer of automatic fit across Central Europe.
But it is only by the success in the competition and its medialisierung is also aware of the nicht-fachöffentlichkeit.
"not only that our customers the brand is now clearly farmet intensive exercise, including our foreign partners, began the fact with a company to be able to work in their country has achieved success, attach greater value," says Mr Karel žďárský.
Last year was in farmet but not only in the sign of the euphoria of victory for.
The acknowledgment came from the economic results of the company in 2008, and in a part of 2009.
And just in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of werkzeugbauprodukten.
The crisis, which at that time were still less the citizens but, above all, businesses, just schüttelte reached its peak, many companies were forced to suspend their investment projects and the purchase of new equipment and technology.
"this situation we could also, of course, not escape."
"The sales were 40 percent back, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," said Karel žďárský
A viable companies must also sometimes such unpopular measures.
There was, however, the situation in order to control and the company in the black figures, although with lower than before the crisis.
In one of the company was not prepared to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"from the grant we cultivated a research and schulungszentrum, we bestärkten our presentation at international fairs and studying hauptpreise domestic exhibitions," says žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again, and with them, the number of new staff.
"The new winner I wish much joy of victory - but in ruhigerer atmosphere," Karel žďárský.
An opinion poll, with nonsensical rules cleaning up
The opinion poll "the absurdity of the year" for the fourth time is part of the unternehmerwettbewerbs.
Some daft rules already succeeded, from the world.
The unlikely winner of the next poll "born in the absurdity of the year" has the duty to create documents to authorities, which are available online.
As more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So he asked for the sozialversicherungsverwaltung a papierauszug from the commercial, even if the officials had access through two click of a mouse.
Thanks to the opinion poll is changing that now.
"The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung in future will be in control of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the commercial demand more," said the spokeswoman čssz Jana buraňová.
Sense and purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity" of the year it is, all the rules and orders to examine the entrepreneurs have to meet in the Czech Republic and the nonsensical.
This is the fourth time this year, part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs, of the tsch. Business daily (hn) and will be hosted in public.
If, in the last year of the three thousand people participating in the vote, it was in earlier this year four thousand.
No wonder, because there is still a lot of statutory duties, which only serve to hamper the activity.
"What, for example, the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned, we will take a front rank in the world," said Karel havlíček of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and gewerbetreibender of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in recent years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, but hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the 74. Grade A, compared to the previous year to eight places a poorer place.
The absurdity of the year competition was declared for the first time in years, and plays each year after the same situation.
We can all of April until can inject some up-to-date input of competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register the website address is seeking www.firmaroku.cz. then the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "antipreis" from the public and the Internet on the websites of www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It triumphs that absurdity, which gets the most votes.
For this year " s poll have already been more than a hundred specifically, 105 senseless rules and orders.
The tips are not only of entrepreneurs, but also of professional organisations and journalists.
Among the nominees, "finalisten" of the competition, for example, include provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge for motorways and have to pay a toll expressways, or that employers with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year 's "seven" is in the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition each at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happenings, regularly to the people of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva svobodová, the director of the Association of small or medium-sized businesses and the tsch gewerbetreibender. Republic and Petr kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the tsch. Republic at the height of the competition for the long haul.
"where the state of the entrepreneurs spanner, there can be no real economic recovery, that is why it is my aim, every year at least thirty paragraphs, today, the entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their operations," said Martin kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts of nonsensical orders from the world, to create effective.
In 2007, was the people most entrepreneurs on duty, the gewerbeamt on the ground of their permanent company three days in advance of the intention to declare, with a ausstellungsstand to an exhibition or kirmes want to drive.
This duty was force a review of the gewerbegesetzes lifted.
The duty in 2007, the second largest number of votes received - the duty of the job, the missions of workers in the scope of up to 30 days to notify must, by law, it has been on so-called "green card" has been abolished.
And - all good things come in threes.
The absurdity of the year 2009 has been elected to the regulation, physical therapists, sprechzimmer imposed in a mirror, a refrigerator and two personenwaagen.
This regulation introduced by the Ministry of Health in somewhat mitigated this year - the kühlschrankpflicht fell away.
A new category validates socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sports projects
A novelty in this year 's already fifth batch of competition, the business daily (hn) is the category of "responsible company of 2010."
Idea of the competition, it is reasonable and fair to promote enterprise.
"We want to support these companies, which are the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment are aware and socially responsible support initiatives," says Patrik bartholdy, the regionalmanager of mobilfunkunternehmens vodafon, the ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, and the competition of the year "rebel" is.
For the year " s first vintage of this particular underclass of the hauptwettbewerbs vodafon firm of the year little companies, for which the success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough food for a self-employed article.
Although they are in relation to the subject of their activity is diametrically opposed to distinguish their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it is, for example, in order to gehandicapte people, because by personal problems, or the health of their own staff.
Among the 14 finalisten from across the Czech Republic appeared so, for example, the Prague software company et netera on that created not formal sportteams among their staff, who then at many tournaments in a wide range of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region, Commissioner for Pardubice, is the society isolit-bravo, the main sponsor of the past 17 years stiftungsfonds for gehandicapte children.
A paper mill from poděbrady cares for their exemplary health disabled employees, the 70 per cent of its workforce, for which they are entitled "responsible company, the region mittelböhmen" was celebrated in competition; Vodafone firm of the year, it documented in the context of this region of the third grade.
In the region of Olomouc defeated the buchhaltungsfirma miryz soft, amongst other things, that the fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week and this meant reduced hours without cutting wages, proportionate.
The jury in the honorierte titelverleihung also to the fact that the company sells mainly in Czech manufacturers, citizens' initiatives in their area and support for green principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment to keep as low as possible," said its CEO miluše ryznarová.
The responsible enlogit it firms in the region Ústí nad Labem, meanwhile, is in the health of his staff and that is why it to you all notebooks ergonomische armchairs and tastaturen creature, it also promotes on its employees work and in firmenaktionen they cartering-dienstleistungen used by a local workshop protected.
"In addition, we support the Foundation" people in need, "the local roma-kommunität concrete assistance," says Ondřej suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least is the activity of the reinigungsfirma "praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region worth noting their employees in the form of extra-bonussen contributes to their pensions.
"We are giving our employees' contributions to the food, for the distances, to increase their skills and for the holidays," says Joseph strapáč of the construction company czasch from bruntál, the winner in the mährisch-schlesischen region.
On category responsible firm of the year were automatically all bezirksfinalisten of competition vodafon firm of the year, the questions of the registration enclosed questionnaire beantwortetet and it at least by the 15.august the organisers of zuschickten.
Wrong or incomplete answers please in the questionnaire by the organisers were excluded from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing firms the unanswered questions left by the competition, they were" responsible firm of the year "ruled out, in the hauptwettbewerb Vodafone firm of the year, they were not at all."
"a separate registration only to this competition is not possible, because it is only an underclass of the hauptwettbewerbs firm of the year," said Karel Goldman of the organising agency bison & rose.
Bodenfonds pilsner, arrests the police during a public invitation to tender
In the building of the bodenfonds in Pilsen, the antikorruptionspolizei arrests in the last few days.
It was the European medien-unternehmer and immobilienhändler luboš G. of the detektiven in handcuffs.
These had allegedly tried to just held a public competition to the liquidation of restitutionsansprüchen manipulate, that the competition land offered a concrete zufielen interested.
This should luboš G. for half a million have been paid.
"at this stage, I can only confirm that the police have a person because of the offence of fraudulent practices followed by a public competition," said antonie zelená, the head of the pilsner public prosecutor 's Office for the newspaper, "právo," it could further details regarding the ongoing studies did not give.
24 hours later, the 46-jährige entrepreneurs of the police fired back.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, we can, given the little official information only speculation.
The speaker of the bodenfonds Lubomír černá led to the question of právo, the police have acted in the pilsner antenna of the bodenfonds actually arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was a client, and not one of our staff," they provide.
The public competition, according to Mrs černá had the correct name 'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land under the land law "and would take place in cases in which several applicants interested in the property bezeigen offered.
"these people offer within the framework of the invitation a higher value of their through the transfer to begleichenden restitutionsansprüche when the proclaimed grundstückswert."
"in accordance with the range of claims will be the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the bodenfonds the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund.
Luboš G. were obviously information available to anyone who is at the instigation and had registered since it was even legitimate person, because he is a series of restitutionsansprüchen had bought, he offered a grundstücksinteressen, announced that he was withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
It would also be an adequate explanation for his arrest, which is why he is such a large sum of money for the author.
Luboš G. already had in the past too good contacts with the bodenfonds pilsner.
So he played in the issue of the former bosses of the bodenfonds Václav sankota a role, the prosecution, because he was in ersatzrestitutionen plots, which already have to mention had been made to the building.
At that time, acquired by the bodenfonds luboš G., for instance, the land for the construction of public roads, more specifically, on the site, where the construction of the zufahrtsmagistrale for industrial area borské Pole was planned.
Later he exchanged this very cheaply with the St. directly against a House in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The town hall had to kleinbeigeben was with a heavy heart, for the works not by blocking of the land.
The cost of living increase the budgets for a few hundred a month
Households need not only from January with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with more water and abwassergebühren and for district heating, and some are growing also rents.
Families are so from January several hundred kronor a month more from the wallet must draw than hitherto.
Electricity is up by 4.6 per cent more expensive, gas by 2 per cent, and longer in some cities, it will be up to a tenth of more for wasserlieferungen must pay some of the more expensive and also fernwärmelieferungen.
The stromteuerung alone costs the wohnungshaushalte every year a few hundred kronor.
The starkstrompreise were reduced by all the main suppliers, blame is the promotion of electricity produced from renewable sources, notably from fotovoltaikanlagen.
Although gas is only moderately more expensive, but this is precisely when people most need heating and have the highest consumption.
Here too there is, therefore, with a few hundred kronor per year.
While electricity and gas in the Czech Republic will be more expensive, the price of district heating, vary from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price increases.
It must, for example, households in Hradec Králové, Commissioner for Pardubice, and from January for district heating up 50 kronor per month to pay more, more than 1,000 kronor per year in pay families carried out by Liberec.
The people of Prague, in turn, threatening 9 percent higher water and abwassergebühren and this is the case that the city of the infrastrukturmiete increases.
If the rent does not improve, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole of the Czech Republic but also continue to be one of the lowest.
In northern Bohemia, where the prices are already among the highest, to water and abwassergebühren by 7.4 per cent rise.
Huge mietpreiserhöhungen include, for example, in 140,000 choose to expect that from January in which the so-called mietregulierung disappearing.
So, for example, the wohnungsunternehmen CPI byty in Ústí nad Labem 2,500 homes, rents from January in order to increase equal to 100%.
Anyone who does not agree with this mieterhöhung, the company wants to use the judicial proceedings.
The regulated rents, the one still in approximately 300,000 homes are likely to pay next year by more than 10 per cent rise.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally, who is also a good whisky, the one from the father of the hausbar has stolen.
These are the drinks, for whose benefit from drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most commonly notbehandelt must be.
No exceptions are children, the repeated their hangovers in the hospital ausschlafen.
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics are facing.
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it was simply too long until you get drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk Pelikán, who used the senior physician of the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice.
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle from the hausbar to, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then it is not as strong smell," said the senior physician.
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right.
"most frequently involves Fernet or rum."
"This is the alkoholtrend today, particularly in primary schools."
"It was important to slivovice, we feel at home," said Mrs jurinová.
Senior physician Pelikán according to dreizehn- or 14-year drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme no anomaly.
Before the clinic in hořovice, in which he has been working this year, he was 10 years in the pädiatrie-abteilung of the hospital motol, where the rettungswagen angetrunkene pupils from both near and far then.
"A girl four times and had to be taken."
"It began their careers with 12 years ago, when she was the first time with 3.5 per alcohol in the blood and in combination with" extase "was admitted," the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"It was in the ausstellungsgelände in Holešovice on any tanzparty."
"The interesting thing is that it was their mother is not at all strange was that their daughter, not 48 hours came home," the senior physician wonders.
The lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance at the launch of its own with the sprösslingen is one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A true dependency in the true sense of the word, it is not, according to experts in children.
"under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case in these children."
Among those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer characteristic background, "said senior physician Pelikán.
The spokeswoman for the hospital, according to motol Mrs jurinová, have until the middle of November, around 40 drunken children in the abandonment of department of child and jugendmedizin instructed.
But only with the cases of serious five-year, the one in hospital, go in the statistics.
Drunken children who, in ambulatory care of the parents or, if necessary, by the police to be brought home, will not be registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only time so a bottle of spirits in the schulbank austrinken there after opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, on the 100% is good: walpurgisnacht, Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter is for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor or testimony from joy to the holidays."
"in the walpurgisnacht, I have also already been seven drunken children at once in the opening," stressed Pelikán experienced doctor.
A betrunkenes child spent the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off, as a child, the only the next day with a nasty hangover.
The headaches in the morning, then by the dehydration and the glukosemangel shocks, it is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose and nutrients, the absence of the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, raise them with good humour, without that somewhere a little ache."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits he is a doctor Pelikán, with the patients at least sometimes the good humour dish, by offering them the cost of which, the treatment will cost.
Because of the transport with the rettungswagen and the night in a akutbett are well and very much like to have a few tens of thousand kronor.
"Every now and again I used this as an educational instrument, if I directly to the children in the trip have have calculated their drunkenness, which has cost, and that it may well happen, that it is time the whole holidays about having to work the money for a single to deserve such fete," added doctor Pelikán added.
In his view, the health insurance companies are not, however, after regressverfahren to curing the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
Two trainingsflugzeuge l-159 in foreign hands - the first time in Spain.
Two light aircraft l-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Defense Ministry against the Casa c-295m transport aircraft has exchanged, on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer EADS Casa - sets.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were so far only in flugshows manoeuvres or to see.
It concerns the flugfähige zweisitzerversion l-159t1, which the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige l-159.
These are currently still einkonserviert aero vodochody, the mediator in this business - the company omnipol - she has taken over last week.
When you physically from the aircraft expediert vodochody is Jan pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence is not yet known.
The einsitzigen fighter l-159 again from long term were stored planes being singled out and this without further deposits and investment on the part of the Department of the Ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen l-159t1 in current condition and appearance," said pejšek exchanged the newspaper právo.
He added that the army will not be without zweisitzige fighter, as the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with aero vodochody a 200-millionen-vertrag on the conversion of four superfluous l-159 to zweisitzigen version of sign.
A new aircraft, the army in July, the second it will take until the end of this year.
Pejšek according to EADS, the warplanes in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"the Treaty is clearly, that the company EADS buyer of the aircraft is l-159 and that those to the training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the abnehmers ways in which he carried out the matter," said pejšek.
The business daily (hn) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the l-159.
The barter of five l-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion crowns last year was still of the government of Mirek Topolánek has been approved.
The Ministry of Defence had failed to put out to tender but not tendering shopping, spoke directly to EADS.
The former verteidigungsamt argued this exchange will be the future of exporting the l-159 support abroad.
The Czech army bought aero 72 machinery, from which they only 24, used the rest of it wanted to sell.
The purchases of the aircraft, a Casa should still have legal process.
The European Commission sued the Czech defense ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have put the aircraft due to a ganzeuropäischen tender must select and not raise through a single manufacturer.
The army already has three aircraft Casa, the last is within 14 days kbely landing at the airport.
A longer than ringfinger finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose finger is long, than the ringfinger, are clearly a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That is the surprising results of a study on Wednesday by the British journal of cancer, has been published.
It is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can serve this especially for men to 60," said the joint author of the study, Ros eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Centre at the University of WARWICK.
The finger may help to determine what men are necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, such as, for example, family health burdens, added Mrs eeles added.
In the period of 1994-2009 chase after them with their colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study was the finger in the right hand is shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, such as for 19% of those men, whose ring- and finger were the same length.
In men, whose finger was longer than the ringfinger, this risk, however, fell by 33 per cent for men to 60 even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned finger, which is already in the antenatal age, apparently reflecting the different mirror of to be administered, which the child in the womb.
Less testosterone is a finger longer.
Previous research found that testosterone is the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said he emphasized that he is aware of this study is fragile, he nevertheless consider the relationship between the fingerlänge and the cancer has not yet been proven for "completely."
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and blocked D5
Just as the biggest part of Europe is also the Czech Republic on Thursday morning, under a snow cover.
On the streets and gehwegen is mostly frozen snow, the winterdienstler in many places were the whole night at axis.
The D5 kilometres of motorway between 89 and 90 in the direction rozvadov is some accidents of lorries and cars because of being blocked and also the D1 in Brno towards Prague "is."
This novinky.cz told the dispatcher the central auto-moto-klubs (úamk).
In kilometres 91; a lorry in kilometres 93 met two lorries, together with this accident there are injuries.
A few cars are in the gutter.
There are also problems with 185 kilometres of motorway D1 towards Prague.
Here are two lorries collided.
The driver just behind in Brno should get 190 kilometers or about Brno and drive in 182 kilometres in place kývalka rules.
There will be queues of traffic jams.
Also on the d11 is an accident and that the building to Prague.
Even in Prague is one of several centimetres thick snow cover and the temperature is minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolonnen form, for example, in the stadteil prosek, also the road štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport, there is in any case the metro.
The trams are driving with delays, for example, on the line between karlsplatz and friedensplatz.
At 8 a.m., the Prague crisis together.
Also in the railways and the airport, there are problems.
The Czech state-run rail company had to cancel because of schneeverwehungen seven schnellzugverbindungen.
There are problems for example, at the Prague - kralupy or Prague - beroun.
The passengers should be informed about the current situation.
The airport is ruzyně since Wednesday night, 11 p.m. until 5 a.m. closed.
The majority of roads in the South are only used with greater caution.
In order to vyškov are three minor roads completely unbefahrbar, in the vicinity of Brno form schneeverwehungen places and in the vicinity of blansko is forced, on some higher schneefräsen nearby streets.
One of the most affected areas Výškov.
There are three roads are still closed completely: rousínov - slavkov, bohdalice - kučerov and also šaratice - milešovice.
Here too it will be to schneeräumung schneefräsen must defend.
When they are used, can be assessed until now.
In the region hodonín is in the field of weißkarpaten caution.
On the streets, from naturschutzgründen only with inerten streumitteln cannot be achieved, is one of up to five centimetres thick snow cover, he emphasized.
In the Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimetres neuschnee, most in northern Bohemia - in places by 18 centimetres.
In the mährisch-schlesischen region fell up to 15 centimetres neuschnee.
In the Czech Republic to hear it but slowly to schneien.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
The American troops in Afghanistan have for the first time, a new "smart" weapon, which has so far only under their codebezeichnung xm-25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon in the conflict there with the Taliban, and to shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a supergenaue walnut.
The projectiles are by lasers with an accuracy of only a few metres into the goal.
The special shells of 25 mm mortars, which have been developed for this rifle and contain dangerous explosive, functioning practically as small grenades.
The shells can be programmed, that they are not just at the moment of impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic flight can explode.
In other words, they can be used against an enemy, behind a barrier, a wall or in a trench.
From the top, he is usually is not protected, the murderous stahlsplitterregen from the top it can therefore easily finishing.
Richard audett, according to the development of the xm-25 contributor, is the new kampfgewehr the first infanteriewaffe, the "smart" technologies.
"The soldier is basically as before: he is seeking the objective and sends a laser beam from the distance, so he gets a precise visierpunkt, after which he corrected the erhöhungswinkel, then all he needs only abzudrücken.
"We say, it has 543 m measured."
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting the geschoss on the removal of 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be relocated to
Fujitsu, the company shifted its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year will be 400 employees their jobs from the current office building on marienbader place in bad homburg, in the astro park.
Fujitsu, the Japanese company relocated its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
As on the computers and their maintenance specialist branchenriese on Wednesday, will be announced in July next year, 400 men and women, their work from the office building on marienbader place in bad homburg, in the astro park, this is a great bürokomplex at the Lyons street in the Frankfurt area of niederrad.
A spokeswoman from Fujitsu explained, in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs will be housed in the company, which has spread to the region.
The mietangebot is extremely attractive, would also have been the open-plan offices in the astro park the functioning of the staff better.
Also in bad homburg Fujitsu was only tenants.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "with frankfurt-niederrad, we have a central location with excellent infrastructure has been found."
The excellent link to the airport was just for a global companies such as Fujitsu is of great importance.
The new move a major company in the region yesterday called joy at the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The Frankfurter wirtschaftsdezernent Markus frank (CDU), said it was yet another 'Global Player' has been won.
It was a "fantastic standortbekenntnis."
Fujitsu pass for the city, the settlement is an important boost for niederrad.
The bad homburger Mayor Michael korwisi (the Greens) lamented the decision by Fujitsu.
The city is early from the management on the intention had been informed.
"We have offered our assistance to the company, of course," said korwisi.
The friendly contacts but had nothing to do with the difficulties of the computerherstellers with the landlords of the property on marienbader place can change.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have made all the difference.
Now, it is a long leerstand in such a prominent role to prevent it.
"I hope the owners and landlords of the building is cooperative."
Fujitsu has been used by the House on rathausplatz and the neighbouring "small vertical" were some of the other buildings on marienbader place ten years ago to the most controversial works of the kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private projektentwicklers arose between the railway station and a new stadtentree town hall, both because of the massive building than the earlier part of park land, as well as the size of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the anlageberatungs- and ratingunternehmen feri, the software-hersteller for reisevertriebssysteme, start Amadeus, and at the time was still associated with Fujitsu Siemens computer manufacturers the houses.
The building was used by Fujitsu in 2006 by the Frankfurter German immobilien-chancen-gruppe, together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish falcon real estate investments SA in Madrid sold.
In Tokyo, the beheimatete fujitsu-konuzern calls itself as the third largest it-provider in the world.
It is companies, for example, computers and servers ready and also makes the necessary service.
The branch in the rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, much larger employer but Fujitsu in Munich.
From bad homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu technology solutions in frankfurt-niederrad a, the new subsidiaries at this site and Fujitsu services to a company called TDs.
Were in the office building for astro park killed 7,000 square.
In the twenty years old complex - the name is playing for his sternförmigen footprint - has, among other things, the zentralverband elektrotechnik- and electronics industries of his seat.
Amazon frees servers - threats against Assange has
Wikileaks equipment are increasingly in trouble.
The internet-dienstleister Amazon has the enthüllungsplattform from its servers.
May is behind this political pressure after the publication of hundreds of diplomaten-depeschen secret.
WikiLeaks founder Assange has is supposedly in England.
The enthüllungsplattform WikiLeaks device in the United States increasingly under attack.
The internet-aktivisten lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking a internet-heimat in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, appealed to other countries and businesses to boycott of WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has, on the fahndungslisten by Interpol is, according to a news in Britain.
"WikiLeaks from amazon-server."
"free speech in the land of the free," shared the enthüllungs-aktivisten kurznachrichtendienst via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Amazon Europe in the wikileaks-dokumente from its servers.
The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen on the Amazon web services (AWS), resorted to the high zugriffszahlen on the documents to be able to cope with.
Via Twitter to WikiLeaks said the step further: "fine, our dollars are being spent now, in order to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon this kind of problem with the speech, "they should stop trying to sell books."
Amazon have the use of its servers by WikiLeaks halted after staff members of Senator Joe Lieberman had enquiries, told the CNN TV company has been under appeal at the office liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on homeland security Amazon had threatened to boycott, told the British "guardian."
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this action sooner in the light of previous publications by WikiLeaks classified information," said the senator.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called on the platform, and in other countries to deny the use of servers.
"WikiLeaks' enormous illegal and reckless action, our national security and endangering life" around the globe, " in a communication of the other independents senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or ausländisch - should WikiLeaks in his efforts to help to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange has, in the light of vergewaltigungsverdachts of the authorities in Sweden is being sought, is on the fahndungsliste of Interpol.
According to a report in the London newspaper the independent "keeps the 39-year-old Australians in the UK, the exact location is Scotland Yard known.
The internet-aktivist has the investigations in Sweden has always intrigue than his opponents.
Wikileaks-sprecher kristinn hrafnsson said in London, there have been threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange has."
That is why Assange has rightly fear for his safety, said hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to be hiding.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to comments from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the wikileaks-enthüllungen tried and executed for treason.
In Canada, said an aide to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - in television, Assange has should be killed "Obama" and "could" use of a drone.
Between the White House and Assange has meanwhile makes a tennis match.
The spokesman for the American President, Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had called for, if you for recently estimated spionage-aufforderungen to diplomats is responsible.
"I am not quite sure why we are of the opinion of a types with a website and take care of," said Gibbs.
"our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than his just a web page."
The American Government is now the protection of their databases fully to the test.
As a special envoy is the vize-direktor of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, told the White House.
Travers was responsible, "the necessary structural reforms" to develop after the disclosure of the botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks had become necessary.
The White House wants to also examine the ways, such as the entire government information informally and safeguards.
The American Government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and active to ensure, you should by the wikileaks-veröffentlichung in jeopardy.
"We have made every effort to contact with them," said außenamtssprecher Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them, if necessary, should be."
The eis-universität
In the "gelato university" in Bologna eiskonditoren to be better prepared for seasons.
The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world.
Where does the whole ice?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, something the eiskonditor antiquated in German, the cream, following all the rules of Italian eismacherkunst.
The gelataio drawers with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, it in the waffel and then selling them.
In order for it to know that we must not after anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who still want to know more about ice, which is not on the "gelato-university" the Italian firm carpigiani over.
The eis-universität, the manufacturer of eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines across the high Italian ideals.
The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world.
But there is also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele.
Some in the midlife-crisis dreaming of a new career, other cars simply time on the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country to the industrial ice-cream, in future, a European quality product offer.
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants to after years in a nerve-racking job eintüten something of their own.
Two young ägypterinnen dream in Cairo to open a eisdiele.
A man from Malta and a from Brazil want the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and improve the Canadian housewife Julia is because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants, firstly the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
It is vital, not only of good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets at his training but also not the icing on the cake of all national and South überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romanticism."
The first step to manufacture seems simple.
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixgerät which, with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees and then cooked immediately on four degrees cools.
Then he turns to the machine on a tap, and out comes a pasteurised White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten.
The teacher immediately they were all practically crowding me with questions: can you only ice cream with natural substances without stabilising factor?
How can one of their own experimentierlust give free rein?
Luciano warns the zeitgeist to mislead.
Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients' speech, perhaps, has nonetheless used stabilisers - usually a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne.
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day, or else it sackt in together, and the customer bites on eiskörnchen louder.
Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavourings.
For the taste of the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients, the one in the obst-abteilung or the sweets of buying supermarket.
In addition, there are there and pasten powder.
"The suppliers will all try to foist onto them dozens of aromatised additions."
"But they should simply time to experiment."
Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse with eggs to a yellow flower with kakaopulver and will form the basis for all kinds of schokoladen-verführungen.
Now, the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen.
Luciano, they each four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; that is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-eis tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains nuts.
The most popular kiwi-eis, the working party, which more fruit, use less water and less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: will pfirsich-püree with a lot of sugar, used the sugars in the grundrezept must be reduced.
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar is necessary.
Luciano prefers a device with which he stressed the sugar content of the fruchtsorten (winegrowers fairs so that the oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the rechnerei easier tables.
Ice does not require longer to make so much physical use as before.
Not just the equipment for the manufacture of the automatic grundmasse helps.
There is even a device, in which the final eis-mischung while at the same time, cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen gekühlt.
Despite all the automation remain small glitch.
The Brazilian Gustavo himself and his kurskollegen intervention from top to bottom with fruchtpüree him, as the überdimensionale hand blenders spirals out of control.
"in every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before such a thing has happened."
Controllers in the zwielicht
The European Food Authority is of the EFSA with genpflanzen experimental industry at all.
This charge now formulated in the expert group testbiotech, as an independent institute for the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte for years are also when lobbyistenverband ilsi under contract.
The will of the corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften worked for genpflanzen and am so that, in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized.
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise word for word with position papers by the ilsi and deceive so that bears the hallmark of the industry, which is actually of the authority in the Italian Parma will be monitored.
It was the second time that testbiotech a interessenskollision share your criticism.
So is a high-level efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have changed sides.
Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) recently had personal links between a few unruly end and lobbies, revealing what the umweltbundesamt as MEPs sit up and take notice.
The EFSA can however, see no conflict of interest.
We will take every serious data back, even to those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it says in a statement.
The experts, the work of EFSA, asking not to be, that they have no contact with the industry.
But they would have to disclose them.
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States.
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag.
In the matter of independent experts criticize how then that genetically modified crops are currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals be allowed and the reaction of genpflanzen environmental shall not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field power," says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test what no reliable results covering.
"If you take risks not addiction, how should we then find you?," asks then accusing.
It also provides for Angelika hilbeck so.
The research scientist since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the technical University of Zurich.
The industry attempts in this area, as in the US is now also in Europe, scientists are becoming more and more critical to influence or discredit.
There is, therefore, are scarcely even researchers, not with corporations are interwoven.
For businesses, critical studies would not normally was published.
"The industry controls the research," claims hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli gsell has also what concerned, a total of about 400 kg.
On Monday night, he stood before Stuttgart station, on the back of the tuba.
It was demo.
It snowed heavily.
The story is well known: in September were the angerückt excavators and had started, a large chunk of the nordflügels.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands protested against S21, the multi-billion dollar tieferlegung of the railway station.
When it came to "freeze," there was a large part of the left in ruins.
Shattered in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer produce, a soft rough stone, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has a few of the headache.
"These are reliquien stones."
"They must not disappear."
He schwärmt: "a cheap and poor Stein, simple and erdenhaft."
When he was a aufsägte, according to zigarettenqualm gerochen.
What he will do with the headache, knows he has not.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell also.
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen to a former munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel rongen his stein-reich has built.
The 44-jährige acts with old stones.
He has bought all the demolition in Stuttgart fell.
"It would be a shame, you would gemahlen Schotter or disappear in the hole," he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, which once was a wachhäuschen.
Insulted and threatened him, he was told, when, in September in the newspapers that he is the remnants of the nordflügels from abbruchunternehmer bought.
But he has with the s-21-gegnern talk for several days.
And he has stated that he does nothing for the demolition.
And now, even if it is, then it is but the most sensible, if the stones were used.
About 200 s-21-gegner took an average of 80 kilos of serious quader with, stückpreis 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but also some in the hope of him in a reconstruction to be able to return.
500 tonnes of rongen had bought 25 large truckloads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Gartenbesitzer, gardeners of the countryside, häuslebauer.
They were coming from everywhere and had weggeschleppt what boot and supporters could bear.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long been in "mäuerle" or turned in by kräuterbeeten limitations.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says rongen.
"would not be the political dimension."
He is rising in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
He has studied law and later suspended biology, then he is for computers is interested in, and eventually become steinhändler.
And steinliebhaber.
40000 tonnes of stones, he found.
From across Germany karrt he combined his treasures.
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He put brakes on it.
In the snow are skilful behauene sandsteine.
"They once belonged to Dresden marienbrücke," he told.
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt.
"My lieblingsstein."
It is the way high through the forest.
It shows a bunch: red sandstein, previously part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"beautiful travertin."
Once the quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart neckarstadions.
Across the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from Stuttgart, rötlicher stone is complemented with more from the cathedral, St. blasien tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
What kind of work that effort, which sweat.
If rongen thinks about how the stones used nail by hand and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren were mobilized, it is not reverential.
"It would be a scandal if such a thing would schreddern."
He is not rich has become very rich, certainly not.
But 14 people, the steinhändler today, also have been up in the forest steinmetze, a sculptor, a Smith, a glasbläser and settled a horticulturalists.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the resteverwerter.
He must soon after Cologne.
Also there are to save the stones.
Talentekampf to high-potentials
There is a flourishing crush on Buffet.
16 students are flocking to lachsbrötchen, tomatensuppe and sweet.
The Technical University of braunschweig and the manufacturer Volkswagen, the maschinenbau- and designstudenten invited to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas should they, together with vw-entwicklern on the car of the future of jargon - and, incidentally, Volkswagen.
In the competition for the brightest minds are now many companies in the nahkampf and as VW, in cooperation with universities.
Their mission: the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hörsälen recruit before they enter the job market and from other umworben.
And because the universities no lists on the performance of their students, is trying to give you the ausnahmetalente in praxisprojekten to spot and keep.
On the second day of the workshop in the tu braunschweig touted the autokonzern for the talent.
A young lady from the personnel distributed pens, wine gum and mappen with vw-logo.
They told the hopeful jungtalenten of praktikumsprogrammen and studentenjobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico selle of the tu braunschweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides, "the students are in contact with the industry and gather more experience."
"At the same time, students can get interesting candidates closer angucken and consider who will be the person in question would be."
Such cooperation, so selle, are not unusual.
Newly was so offensive that the students will gebuhlt.
"otherwise the emphasis was more on the technical project," says selle.
The battle for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, the company can no longer their staff from a large flock of candidates.
But they will have to implement and particularly for highly qualified workers balzen.
Graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in a strong negotiating position.
According to the association of German vdi engineers remained in October about 40,000 ingenieurstellen remain vacant.
And the so-called ingenieurlücke according to vdi-prognosen will be even greater.
For the wirtschaftsprüfungs- and consultants KPMG is dykta novel on the talentjagd.
He organised extensive recruiting-events such as the kpmg-race, do a kind of modern, in which the participants on the basis of gps-koordinaten their way must be found.
Eight promising students want the companies in the next year across the United States.
Incidentally, the participants kpmg-filialen reputation and the company.
Who should decide, in two auswahlrunden in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates in the United States flies.
The cut and thrust of the high potential at the universities of the fight, according to dykta widening.
"We want to have with the race from the mass."
"only a simple segeltörn us was too little."
For talentjäger dykta the bill seems to be working.
"We have until today with all those who took part in a similar action last year contact."
"some completion and wish to apply soon for us," he says.
In addition to the direct courting going on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also quite classic in berufsmessen on the five-inch heels and revealing clothing prowled.
"We are trying to reach students at fachmessen."
"around at the intersolar," reported sitha stübe, human resources administrator at the solartechnikhersteller solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs about 1,500 staff in Germany.
Stübe know about the nachwuchsproblematik.
There are now on the unternehmenswebsite 35 posts put out to tender.
"It is very difficult, vakante positions to be filled."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the uni-professoren.
Solarworld is cooperating with various universities, such as the university in freiberg.
"The professors give indications that we make internships or his thesis letter can."
Expensive promotions are in the solarspezialisten not ever.
The company is looking for other benefits for themselves, to promote: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"That is a großkonzern often do not offer," says stübe human resources administrator.
Money for the unemployed is no longer the starring role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are further decisive factors.
Solarworld documented in a study of the great place to work institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute is drawing up an annual bestenliste German employers.
Asked how satisfied are employees with their work and their jobumfeld and look at the conditions for the employees.
Human resources administrator stübe, hopes of the ranking points scored, too, in the jobsuchenden.
"I think that applicants, particularly after external assessments about a potential employers look," she says.
Wolf pure kriegler of the German employer branding Academy, which advises companies with a long-term strategy of a good reputation as an employer to build.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means according to kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to attract as employer, on their own staff," he says.
In the branchenjargon is the internal employer branding, arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own workforce.
"satisfied employees are the best ambassador."
If his people well and do they identify with the companies, then they would simply friends and known for their employers.
"It is a game with a gang," says kriegler.
Obama stop new drilling
Off the coast of the us-bundesstaats Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years there will be no new drilling.
Such a ban, the government in Washington - and so that their previous plans were withdrawn once and for all.
Also in the Atlantic coast remain for new Drilling techniques.
This Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar said Wednesday.
The catalyst for the strict ban on which, at least for the next five years should apply, is the explosion of the bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry to its willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want the dependence of the United States from foreign oil.
Who was responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally settled.
In the centre of the criticism, the British energy company BP, which is faced with milliardenforderungen.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama is, in the course of 2008 to submit their results.
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar the bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
Following various oil companies had immediately applications for new bohrvorhaben.
With stricter controls and tougher safety regulations want Obama and Salazar a repetition.
At the moment, the competent supervisory authorities, which, after numerous corruption charges was in disrepute, radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that lucrative loopholes for the oil and gaskonzerne.
The industry warns now publicly before, that the level of production in the Gulf by a tighter regulation would be markedly lower than hitherto.
"the plans of the government are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current branchenumfrage by the consultant bdo - even before the bohrverbot from Wednesday.
The American energy alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what happened with the regulation that will change."
Investment in new projects would be delayed until further - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burnt
The water in the rivers, as it is ölbraun smell at the petrol station: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil, the nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria destroyed.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen.
Celestine akpobari mean well.
"Do not consuming," reassured the ökoaktivist the journalists: "You will still have enough oily slime from the lens wars."
The 37-year-old Nigerians attempt, has followed a until the chest in water watenden young with the surrounding schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz sets the scene almost nicely.
That under the surface rohölschwaden Brown is not to see.
They have been here eimerweise shrimps, told badom Esther collected on the edge of the bodo-jetty-flusses.
Now is the lazy fluid waters completely dead.
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen quantities of crude oil pipeline in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo must now pull together for about six hours, in order to reach fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta Ogoniland is enlarged, as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the flussläufen criss-crossed by mangrovensümpfe will the full extent of the devastation stand out.
Instead of bright water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe, who put his hand up into the water, ölige finger.
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the soil, sad leave as their wedel scattered palm trees.
Vogelschwärme, as usual, in wetlands are meted out: as soon as the außenborder silence is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise ghastly calm.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy: "We are living in constant danger for the health."
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate.
The area where they live the Ogoni is a disputed battlefield for decades: this burst, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organized here in the 1980s, with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa death later the first resistance, here the shell-konzern 1993 had to stop its production, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Nor is today the company denied the return after Ogoniland: while from the whole of the delta region of the triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 bohrquellen plumbing and 7,000 kilometres a day more than two million barrels of the black gold, are pumped into the oil fields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation.
Every few hundred metres stählerne stand out gestelle as bizarre sculptures from the water: "christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes have much to zärtlich.
They are up to 50 years old, the most korrodiert to the core.
Again and again breche such a bohrkopf diverge, believes akpobari rinne, then a constant flow of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres are experts estimate in 50 years ago has gone into the Delta ecosystem: year after year, the amount of oil, as they are now more in the wreck of the 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years into the sea off Alaska drive - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who continued for the ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it will be.
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria do much lower safety standards than elsewhere in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard Steiner in 2008 alone, the company: the rate of defects in the pipes is "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place of from the distant as an abandoned ölverschmierte workshop, open-air, looks up from the mangroven on: they are splitternackt and up to our necks ölverschmiert.
Under one of the many barrels, with the proportion of tubes, partly linked to arbitrarily scattered on the site have come to identify, a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie.
In the barrel, the crude oil on the fire several hours, said Michael cooked, the head of the group.
First enters petrol through the pipes in the auffangtopf spits, later, at the end of the leadership of kerosene and diesel.
So produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels à 300 litres of diesel: "it brings us 34.000 naira a" - around 22 dollars.
The deltabewohner benefit the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only through a single refinery.
With less than 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low price of diesel oil can the illegal kocher has undercut their raw material: because they have been in vain.
He comes from "bunkerern," which the pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: in this way, to go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger delta on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of crude oil lost.
Only a very small part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material is illegal, however, veredelt: fill the lion 's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military personnel should belong in tankers and basement him on the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster, rather than the activities of the population or the lax production is due to the activist akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies would not be perceived as invaders and they would have been the livelihood of the fishermen will not be so thoroughly destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni people, above all, to Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the Group of the question would be: "perhaps are different nationalities, such as the Chinese better."
There is Michael nervous.
"high time that their disappears," says the muskulöse ölmann.
"every minute of the soldiers can."
The illegal ölveredler of the special forces, threatening caught them no arrest, but a painful of receiving bribes.
The mainly from the North, soldiers want - like all Nigerians - of the raw material benefit.
"This damn stuff, our country in every respect to the dog," says akpobari brought.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in a380-triebwerken
The A380 has evidently a big security problem.
Investigators have made in the investigation of a notgelandeten machine discovered a possible construction defects, of a "catastrophic" plane could lead.
The airline qantas now wishes to sue the motorenhersteller.
The passengers of the notgelandeten qantas-airbus had at the beginning of November, appears to be much more happiness than previously known: the Australian aviation safety authority has in its investigation of a major security problem in the engines of some a380-maschinen noted and now warns of a possible construction defects.
The potential defect could have serious consequences: a ölschlauchverbindung he could produce ermüdungsrisse and leaks, it said in a statement published on this Thursday, the atsb authority.
This could have been "a disaster" plane.
Have been affected by fear produced 20 aircraft engines in the a380-reihe.
Among them is the qantas-airbus, on 4 November notlanden in Singapore.
The Australian carrier has now taken legal action against the British turbinenhersteller opened.
They offered a klagebegründung in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, the him further legal actions against the company.
Qantas-chef Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine parts had been solved and that the damaged wings.
Fear of a oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now be up to 40 engines to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they would undergo more of the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The sicherheitsempfehlung is the result of a collaboration with fear, said atsb-sprecher Martin dolan.
The issue of security is important enough to have been kept, in order to inform all those affected.
After the emergency evacuation of the qantas-maschine had the airline kept its a380-flotte for weeks on the ground.
Singapore airlines, around three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.

Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The German bank wants to separate from their symbol: according to a news report that bank overstretched at seeking buyers for the two bürotürme at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euro could make the property.
Recently, the German Bank made their konzernsitz nicely: the twin towers in the Frankfurter bankenviertel have been modernised; now the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs back.
But now the financial conglomerate to the cost of the renovation appears to be out - and is looking for a buyer for the two tower blocks, such as the 'Financial Times' Germany, citing a spokesman for writes.
Reasons for the planned sale, the spokesman said.
"We always consider whether it is better to own property or to have to sell and then zurückzumieten," he said.
So that gives Germany 's biggest credit institution headquartered already after a short period of time.
The Bank had the doppeltürme only in 2007 for 272 million euro from the investors of a hauseigenen fund, and then repaired tedious.
The energy conversion devoured the data after around 200 million euros.
A sale of the Bank would probably bring a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the now in "greentowers" renamed towers, according to the newspaper to around 500 million euros.
Whether the building again to a fund owned by the Bank to be sold or to an independent investor, is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands of grieve for dead mates
More than 10,000 people have in New Zealand the spilled miners whose after several explosions in a mine were declared dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the security situation in unglücksschacht further is precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, it was in the Pike river mine near the town of greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62 years were humbled in days.
A tube was in the unglücksschacht hinabgelassen, but had found no sign of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions could not rescue services attended a meeting on security grounds.
After the second violent detonation were the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the mates had diminished.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Relatives and friends now commemorated with a commemoration for the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had in radioactive sunshine in greymouth on the New Zealand südinsel genealogy.
Two minutes, they remained silent.
In honour of the spilled miners were 29 tables, on which helmets, lamps and the name of mates.
Also pictures and personal belongings, including clothes and surfbretter, found a place here.
Before the government buildings in the country, the flags flying at half mast.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth "come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John key to those attending the ceremony.
"but they are never came home."
He could not deal with the death of his son, until he saw the body, said lawrie drew, whose son Zen in the pit has been humbled.

Rettungsarbeiter started a fire inside the kohlebergwerks on the südinsel of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were suppressed, so that starting, the glowing temperatures inside the mine herunterzukühlen, said police chief constable Gary knowles to journalists.
Hell, warriors!
The kunstkino splatter fits?
The director Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen newly.
To which the audience may be the Danish director Nicolas winding refn thought as he "walhalla rising" spin?
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (Mads mikkelsen) is liberated from its peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is precisely because our hero like rough used to kill his enemies and have the gedärme from the vibrant life, limb when he has bad humour.
On the other hand, einauge says, as he is known, the whole film is not a word, and also the other characters can at most times to one or two sentences, or a few painful todesschreien.
Otherwise it is in silence and in the gruselig beautiful Scotland, hügellandschaft feasted on the wikingerwelt of about a thousand years, provides the backdrop.
Ideal for adults with more cineasten interest for existentialismus and very quiet kamerafahrten.
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive.
Winding refn, since its director is wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses to stoisch, his works with a little more mainstream humour or a little less brutality to make available to the arthouse.
The most kunstkino-freunde are around the spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen prohibitive.
The latest action-fans will die from boredom, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship after Jerusalem areas and an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team is, it would seem that in America there is and will continue to remain silent.
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising" in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD.
This is particularly due to the superb images a crying shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, it deserves some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or a rigorous action, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum.
And why is there no escape for the viewer.
Refn takes him barely a moment of relaxation and his bags to him with his icy images and the dark trance-artigen soundtrack very slowly to the throat cut, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters they.
Only a small blonder young, the einauge faithful to the side retains something of innocence, as all the others are driven by anger.
The vast majority of the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warriors from hell, possibly to the Ambassador of the devil himself.
It means lost, but perhaps only for the verdorbenen anyway.
"walhalla rising" is a puzzling film, you have to admire the hate and can get angry, and marvel at.
An experience.
Puzzling erdarbeiten
The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA has new evidence of a clandestine nuclear program in Syria.
The country holds out but to comment - nor does it controls.
Midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter I. a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the shores of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is as-saur dair.
Her name is in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley by the electricity.
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA of 2008 would be the end of April, also under the name of Middle village el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, but the technology is hardly from the fifties.
The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with blurred imagery.
By computeranimation they ignored a, where the components of the reactor, before the destruction should be a copy of the North Korean model fell from the atomzentrum Yongbyon.
Moreover, it presented photographs, above, in which the buildings from the vicinity show or even the innenraum.
The reactor was just before the operation, it said, but had not yet been brennstäben peppers.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is scarcely more than it was then known, is the mystery at the time were more important.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria was in el-kibar built a reactor, but saw little evidence that, in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme."
Some intelligence officers in Europe that are rather more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if they cia-präsentation for "plausible."
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was a reactor is said to have a high un-diplomat in summer only, the IAEA "simply had enough material to pose questions."
The rubble of the supposed "dormant" militärgebäudes created the Syrians are hastily aside and planierten the site thoroughly.
It was in June 2008, a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen, in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
Moreover, the IAEA about a Member State of satellite imagery of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which may be more meaningful than those outlined by the CIA.
However, these recordings are on the market, not because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive rights.
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always asserted, has never been a secret nuclear program, farms or to have built a reactor.
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the instructed the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus, refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures.
In addition, the inspectors have been denied a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of a bombed-out building.
But Israel too Stony silence.
"We will never comment on that," confirmed recently by the time of the attack acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, the official position.
As the investigation drags on the case since June 2008 and ineffective "is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna pointless - after all, it is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, on which the IAEA watchdog.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently three other facilities in the "functional link" with the alleged reactor should be - and unlike this still exist.
While the inspectors have so far not revealed what the assets are, or what role they have or what they appear to be suspicious.
According to information the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA as as-sultan masyaf marj internally, and iskandariayah calls, which are derived from nearby cities.
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified in these places and imagery in a complex masyaf, in which it is most likely one of the suspects objects.
It is probably in or directly next to a military base - precisely on these grounds, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is feared the Syrians a fishing expedition - that the IAEA from the United States vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment.
Because the nukleardetektive goods through a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions has become.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was moved back and forth.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion ."
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, to the construction of nuclear weapons are needed.
The type of reactor is with uranium farms, it is not enriched.
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues is there any plausible conjecture.
Also unclear is whether the valuable pieces of debris, traces of mountains, could at the three locations were stored.
As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants information about where the rubble.
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar, on the other side of the Tigris salzmine allocated al-tibni Syria, 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had it in a recent analysis of the imagery for the venerable magazine Jane 's intelligence review with the reactor in mid-afternoon.
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large containers distant, after the IAEA access had requested.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped the suspicion.
In addition, it says the IAEA in diplomatic circles, have used a number of months, a plan for inspections there to develop the Syria should allow any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great is the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus bügelte also this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna ahead of a year, soothed the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not a high sense of urgency, bring about US ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' sonder-inspektionen into the game, one of the harshest means that the Vienna atombehörde, in order to impose controls.
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for an escalation.
On the other, like a diplomat to think: 'What is, if you end up with nothing at all? "
Love in a time of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer, with the work on her still nameless regiedebüt has begun, there is trouble.
The script, she has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more is known about - but not enough for the unrest.
It is rumoured that the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women " s organisations have protested immediately, and some in Sarajevo drehtage planned in the short term after Hungary were transferred.
Now is the film in Hungary tap off and in the postproduktion, but there will still be protested in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic, of the organization of female victim wrote about the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR of Jolie and requesting a meeting with the actress, has a Bosnian newspaper reported now, Jolie is even Ambassador of the un-flüchtlingshilfswerks.
Diplomatically, it is not - it has the women before weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, however.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps did not exist, and Jolie attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script.
Her organization has, according to the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk recommended Jolie as Ambassador, the guardian reported.
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which your script to read has got after some back and forth to a drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie still not happened.
The jungautorin even asserted that they had no political intentions with her film, was with a great deal of effort in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated into it if the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
The content, however, remains vague.
It seems a second synopsis of the film in the network, which is then quite different sounds: the loving knew already caught before war and once again when they meet, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian camp being hijacked, in which he is working as guards.
Which is considerably different sounds when the variant "rape victims in verknallt torturer."
Actually that Jolie film before the war begins - that much is certain.
The pressure on you, so Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation."
Now, she can probably only the hackers from Hollywood for peace: by the script, as so many before, illegally into the net.
Nothing like way here.
On this evening it is finally time right again around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For the heimteam dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States to very much.
The fans johlen with joy in krachend louder music, you scratch with the feet.
The bailey-pub in südirischen Cork, because the players tischtennisbälle on a dreimeterdistanz in bierbecher throw and meetings.
"bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle to win, there is EUR 500 siegprämie plus tickets to Las Vegas for the bierpong-weltmeisterschaften in January.
Cian tanner is a quiet type; this shrill trinkspiel and the cautious computer scientist, which really does not fit together.
But the 26 year old and trying to divert amusement, the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not spielspaß in Las Vegas, he will be in January bewerbungsgespräche in New Zealand.
"I have a mulmiges feeling about this," he says.
"It is so far away from home and I still have no work."
After all: his girlfriend waiting in auckland already on him - "you had to push their wunschjob zuck as eventmanagerin, may be a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of poor prospects at home have already made two of three geschwistern tanners sought their fortunes abroad.
His sister, Yvonne, a sozialarbeiterin, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as a it-berater in London.
The young: like the tanners looks on the island in many families.
100,000 people of Ireland will be the country is likely to leave in the near future, experts say the economic and sozialforschungsinstituts ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they expect even with 200,000 immigrants.
For this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, and a big loss.
The predictions hold true, it is a auswanderungswelle comparable with those in the Ireland in the 1980s suffered.
After a decade of economic recovery, for the Irish, great wealth, power is now conceded again.
The economic crisis throws in particular the young, well-educated Irish, for which there are only projections.
Jobverlust and social decline in the boom years seemed absurd.
Any was needed, there was money available in abundance.
Now, however, three out of ten women and men under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times abound leserbriefe young emigrants, the complaints: "Everything is in Ireland, the Bach error."
"It should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can, go away and our country will lose so that an entire generation."
"The last power then ask the light from."
Jura-studentin leanne caulfield, President of the Irish studentenunion, sees a bright future, raise because the government is only a sham and the young people who have no future prospects, there is much more to offer.
"you reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy, such as new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
They watched as their fellow students from a unpaid work feel to the next.
Their main concern, she says, be it in four years, even to emigrate.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
To try to help men such as Stephen mclarnon positive to occupy the issue.
Mclarnon organised the "workingabroadexpo," a mass, which is a rundumservice on the issue of work abroad.
"for people abroad but the work is a great opportunity, the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On its web site shows photos of a surfer in Australia and snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: to work abroad is not a galeerendienst, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it is to build system elsewhere, knows Seán o 'donovan for half a year.
Because it is for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, there was nothing more to do, he works now with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, you just a fashion house high.
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home is o 'donovan is now only rarely because he extraschichten makes the credit for his house abbezahlen at home.
"The situation is certainly a bit crazy," he says, as he has for a long time for the first time on the threshold of his house.
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am never more."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through ausgekühlte rooms.
The little house is on a subtle neighborhood with leafy front gardens, in the park einfahrten huge, expensive cars.
Together with a sister has o 'donovan the House for four years for 380 000 euros - 100 percent bought credit-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
He was afraid that it could go wrong with the credit?
O 'donovan have taken a while, after adding hot tea and says: "I have no children, I durchfüttern must, and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
It may be that the horror of a civil engineer, not that he often hears at present.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is far from being as dramatic as in former times here on the island," he says.
"a while to work abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps, we feel it only when Irish."
He then laughs and tells of his father, who in the last major economic crisis after England is gone.
"after seven years, he was back and that life in Ireland went further, very simple."
Cian tanner like this idea.
For the future and just look at how it runs with the life elsewhere.
A couple of years of work in London, he is already behind in New Zealand, and why should it not also go well for him and his girlfriend?
There is one thing but, in those days it seemed concerned: the celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that, in a lebewohl-party could degenerate.
"just not too much emotion," says he and drink a great schluck from his beer.
"goodbye, it sounds but frightening."
"We prefer to call it a weggehparty, very loosely, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The demokatrische routine
The movement for democracy in Latin America is stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States.
These findings, the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and exclusively in the economist has been published.
This survey is carried out regularly since 1995, and shows that the people in this region.
Two facts fall in the annual survey of September and October, particularly in 's an eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement intensified S. (table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy annually since 2002 by around 6%, the number of demokratiebefürworter from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has been the sharp drop in the past year recovered, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, and are staunch Democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. diagram 2].
Around 44% of respondents said that they, with the democratic practice of your country satisfied. These are as much as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the past year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crisis undermined the efforts to achieve more democracy.
Also during the Great Depression lasted perhaps, is that the countries of Latin America, only a brief recession and saw a speedy recovery.
In addition, the poor by a stronger safety net - instead.
(according to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week 2009 rose, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is once again this year fell by 32%.)
But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4).
Brazil, strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession Mount was and violent crime have increased, this is less the case.
For only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country, a bigger problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5).
Around 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime. But, compared to 38% in the past year, the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents surveyed at cross-regional level that the private sector for the development is essential, in 2007 there were 56% (S. graph 6).
Some 58% said that only the market can bring their own progress, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalised many private companies.
Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the United States, the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua.
A presidential
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of the poll workers, who rushed to the aid of the beleaguered country.
Overcrowded polls, multiple votes cast, watching ballot papers being filled in the rinnstein, shattered polling stations and intimidation were just a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened up with stundenlanger late.
Many Haitians, many of which, by the earthquake in January had become homeless, too-big-to-fail heaps in search of a choice.
Finally, some gave all.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some of the presumed front runner because of a supposed fraud, demanded the lifting of the election results.
Throughout the country, there was a sometimes violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond mulet, called the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election as a "pretty good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement from observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew célestin, is obliged, will announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap-musiker Michel martelly and the former first-lady mirlande manigat, have their initial ungültigkeitsklage withdrawn.
If the célestin Jew, with voters little or no approval from the wahlberhörde the winner of the runoff, said that this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera outbreak and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still living in tents, was a low turnout predictions.
On the day of many Haitians were due to a lack of organisation at the vote.
Shortly before wahlbeginn were approximately 250,000 cards, the election will be needed, not yet distributed.
There is much at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate government, recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
In the middle of secretly
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy to their beliebtheitsrate 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
Whether it is, however, that in the next year to get re-elected, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, your predecessor and political partner of Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, the economic policies of his wife, drew, was often on the budgets, the tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation does not fully into account.
This allowed the presidential couple then, the extraeinnahmen spend as they see fit.
On paper, the fernández-regierung lost in the last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which a Member of another in the face and others suggested the government of the bribery of lying), managed the Congress not to pass the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss," as the President.
The 2010 budget now is for the next year, leaving the President still has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hot: probably it will this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - the value of up to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was negatively by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector säuberte singled out for bullying and the National Institute of statistics and census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte.
Fernández now can we road?
It has the private sector and the trade union leader has called for talks.
And, according to official statements should wage increases in the next year to 18%, will be limited.
The high world prices for agricultural products of Argentina have a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undercut the burst through a big devaluation of 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández would like Argentina again and economic terms to the rest of the world to follow.
At the beginning of this year, the government had an agreement with shareholders holding the former rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Fernández now appears to have an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which they owe about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, always rejected.
But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado boudou, announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical support." It looks as if this were the first step to cleaning up of the indec.
It is not known whether Mr Fernández, after ending her term even without the support of her husband will be politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the Kirchnerism.
If the Argentines in March to return from their summer vacation, the wave of the sympatie, it has been shown to be, fizzled.
If you want another election win, she must decide whether you many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan voters are coming to slow closer links with the mainland.
What does Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, in the five city 's to elect mayors and councillors. This will be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the development of cutting-edge business, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese motherland, for the first time since 1949 permanently changed.
Ma has insisted the examination, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayor, it received no majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan supports, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago is the support of his party by around 8%.
For the first time the DPP drew even, together with the KMT in the councillors.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as lastwagenkonvois with reclaim flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and sparse dancers worked.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempted.
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and the KMT held on the eve of the election in a speech at a kmt-kandidaten,
When a man from the crowd in the face of lap. LIEN was wounded and a umstehender spectators were killed.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN or kill a dispute with the candidate wanted to settle.
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election, and the DPP in a bad light, which has provided the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winners in the campaign.
It was the relationship with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated over plans to housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and are opposed to China " s militärbedrohung.
This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not want to see in the forefront.
But this time also has avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan 's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese in its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community zurückzulocken.
China sent immediately after Taipei, a negotiator for a summit meeting to prepare for investment and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants a political integration. But the most important thing first.
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself now.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly in favour of the complete independence.
But under tais reign has developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP struggling to find the voices of the professionals and young people.
Tsai took place as a presidential candidate of the DPP great support, such as Su tseng-chang under Chen.
Now, their party is doing everything possible to show that they, too, is in a position to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires open-minded discussion.
Tsai said publicly that their party is a "reliable alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said the candidates from the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence.
He urged the pragmatists Su even on, on the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen interference is difficult for the DPP, its possible to elect candidates.
The KMT will need to undergo a own self-analysis.
Mas values are a bad thing, despite the rapid economic growth; the kmt-kandidaten wanted their campaign without him.
The main reason for his unpopularity seem to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a kmt-sprechers will he, his cabinet and the local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted.
While at the same time, most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist at, "there is already a point of no return."

Mosque in temecula wins approval of the planungsausschusses
The construction of a mosque in temecula took place after a five, often heated public hearing the unanimous commitment of local planungsausschusses.
Critics accused the project both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, is the new religionszentrum local rules and will be a blickfang aesthetic.
"The project is being supported by many good people - of Christians, Jews, Baha 'is, and many others," said Hadi nael, Chairman of the Islamic centre of temecula valley on Thursday morning.
"as Americans makes me proud."
"It shows the fairness."
"There are only a few opponents," added he still added.
"They are just very loud."
"In this Valley lives are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and discussions for and against the construction of the Centre went on until almost midnight, and the votes on both sides, according to the press-enterprise were fairly evenly distributed.
The debate was on the website of newspaper to continue.
"There is no more America," a comment.
"It is a different planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."

Opponents of the City Council can still appeal against the project.
Arsen-resistente microbe could new life on the earth or elsewhere allow
The discovery of a strange variety of arsenic, which can live opens up new possibilities for new life on the earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists say this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"It makes it to a very particular, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life is," said c.w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which the Internet on Thursday in the journal Science.
So far, six key elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But, as the scientists figured out the bacterium grows mono lake in California and then still further, if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic.
"one wonders what else is possible," said the report that the co-autor Ariel Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem lives since scientists life and his forms have to recognise as Anbar.
The study addresses on the earth, the microbes have been found.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery was announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, do not necessarily see are imposed," said Charles cockell, a professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the open university in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research teams.
"This work is a new departure, because it shows that, in fundamental biochemical processes and structures of one element can be replaced by another," added cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they took on that microbes that both are exposed, may be an element in the other.
"The toxicity of the arsens is based above all, that it is chemically similar to behave like phosphorus."
"by the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish between an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It into our biochemisches system, where it is almost covered everything," said Anbar.
The researchers used the bacterium gfaj-1 rising arsenkonzentration. It is suited to and grew.
The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that it can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte lifestyle that can happen, of course, either on land or on any other planet or moon, to the arsenic occur more frequently.
According to Jamie S. foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but until now there has been still no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more, she says that is why the science assumes that early life styles have used it.
"that gives reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a Member in wolfe-simons research team.
The research by NASA, the Department of Energy and the national health authorities.
The rest ausstellungshunde found stolen in compton

But the corgis bunny and Peter, the rickard and Peek this week on behalf of its Japanese owner in the competition to imagine, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and rickard, who lives in redding, were this weekend because of the akc / eukanuba national championship in long beach in the city, because trace in the competition.
As Peek, the Times reported on Wednesday, should the other dogs in the days before the akc / eukanuba-show in other competitions.
Süd-kalifornien is a stop on the almost entire tour of a pair of hundeschau to hundeschau.
On Monday night checkten is Peek and rickard in a motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of her zimmerfenster.
They arrested three other dogs - a boxerwelpen, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with in their motelzimmer.
The dickfelligen akitas and corgis stayed in vans, because there was cooler.
They left the windows sealed a wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.

The lion brüllt back after judicial approval of the mgm-umstrukturierung
After 18-month turbulence and uncertainty MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A new-yorker konkursrichter, on Thursday the "offiziel prepare gläuberplan" from the debt to the tune of $5 billion and to wipe the 86-jährigen unterhaltungsunternehmen to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
According to the testimony on Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the us-konkursrechts, so that the relaunch of MGM, under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger birnbaum, the founders of spyglass entertainment, nothing more. Barber and birnbaum are the slightly slimmed-down studio as chief executive officer.
The staff of about 400 will be reduced to around 320.
For MGM is in Chapter 11 protection in force, when JPMorgan chase a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new mgm-produktionen has concluded.
At the moment is initiating a consortium of the investment bank, even the $75 million of revenue the company. The funding is due to continue until the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009, with the mandate given to the investment bank moelis & Co. management, with interest payments in excess of $300 million / year, struggled with the solution to their financial problems.
In August, the chief executive Harry sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and umstrukturierungsexperte, krispy kreme through his work with doughnuts was known.
The efforts of moelis & Cooper, the finanzsorgen mgms to try and resolve the more than 140 gläuber of the studios, auszubezahlen lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties at the end of 2009, the company offer to purchase.
But the auction drew only a few bidders on and nobody wanted to be required by the creditors $2 billion.
In the spring of this year started everything from ahead, when the mgm-team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October from creditors was signed.
If MGM in the next few weeks, the bankruptcy of officially has overcome moelis and Cooper received for their work and a bonus of several million dollars.
The proportion of moelis & Co. already have received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who led the company for the month, $375.000 was paid a "erfolgsbonus received" of $4 million.
Barber and birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the only a film studio and produced a budget with seven or eight films, at the beginning of 2012 in the cinema.
They also plan to two films after "the hobbit" in small co-produktion with Warner bros.
The studio is needed to a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, directed by Peter Jackson will result.
The investor Carl icahn, the approximately 18% of the mgm-darlehens has funded, tried a merger of the studios with lions gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder who he is.
But the recent negotiations between the two companies has led to any result.
Tech toys keeps in the balance geschenkebudget
This year " s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft kinect videokonsole. Both games can be given a considerable hole in their geschenkebudget tearing.
An iPad costs as much as five bmx-räder for $99, while the price of a kinect-spiel around 10 classic springseilen or around 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can geschenkebudget spare it.
I recently visited on the search for three elektronikspielzeugen below $80 for three national spielzeughändler - a Wal-Mart, a toys "R" us and a bj 's wholesale club.
I was immediately clear that Moore 's law came into force. This year, the technologiespielzeuge more efficient and cost less than the same time last year.
And while fewer new toys with its own web site, is to appear on the best-known of this kind, webkinz and club Penguin, an improved supply.
There are always more knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(unless otherwise stated, all prices of toys "R" us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are plüschfiguren, as large as guinea pig, the sing a note, if you are on your belly.
Even push corresponds to a note by mehrmaliges push you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: if you with the push started, they can no longer stop.
For a combination of gesand and dance is the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from the age of 2) the best choice.
On the basis of the last year developed elmo live-technologie offers the animatronische doll recantations as "Simon says, ', and thanks to the new scharnierfüße with radblockierung they dominated the moon-walk.
Children, the quiet where monetary using the device, Mickey as tanzlehrer. Their parents, however, complained about the lack of lautstärkeregelung.

Police in China are softer
As a ausbildungsoffizier step Tang shenbin on an urban space, revised his nervous subordinates, and placed it with military authority and depressed voice orders.
He wanted, that its female members of the chengguan, China " s robust discharge of the urban order, might have been feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and their propensity to violence - the viewer.
"exactly!"
"look straight ahead!"
"It shows you," he told you to, "how beautiful girls!"
Four teenage girls, hardly the marks, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were staunchly.
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader series.
Four proper hats, sat at the perfect with blau-weiß ribbons are proprietary hair.
"for me, you see, on average, from," says Mr Tang disparagingly.
"models are nicely."
Several governments have already tried, the image of China stadtinspektoren polishing.
In a city all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong, instead of the graugrünen a leuchtend blue uniforms.
Wuhan in mittel-china substituted violence by niederstarren: 2009 skittered on reportedly 50 officials not a properly established imbisswagen and gaze at the operator to until this after half an hour einpackte and left the room.
Xindu, a every individual district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would radically alter the image.
Since 2003, 13 women to strengthen the urban polizeistreifen. They were special because of their appearance, their good figure, and their youth.
They are the grobschlächtigen police a softer, femininen aspect.
But unfortunately, it would also not be scarlett johansson, the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos, have to improve.
With the right, as the critics.
Unlike the police officials who allowed these urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media show routinely a different picture.
In January 2008 in Hubei province officials beat a bystander to death, as this you with his mobile phone as she filmed a protest against a dumping ground niederschlugen.
In the last year has been a schulungshandbuch the Beijing officials had stolen and posted on the Internet. This will describe how criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.
In this year wassermelonenhändler suffered a Shanghai after completely overshadowed with five officials gehirnverletzungen.
A strotzendes videogame violence that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows China trained officials during an attack on hawkers.
"chengguan power of the government fear," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper, called for a "really thorough cleansing."
There are skeptics of the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
As the distrik in October by advert eight female sought recruits, an editorial in the Beijing evening news, the question of whether the women had real tasks or only as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to vacancy notice women were aged from 18 to 22, with a good figure and Penelope looking like a "harmonious."
They should be abnormally large - about 1,5m or 5 foot, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the age of 26 birthday.
According to the officials who work for women over 25 to physically demanding.
"the most important thing is your image," was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com.
"whether the candidates will get depends on the job, first by their external appearance, such as size, weight, gesichtszüge, etc."
Then temperament and "inner qualities."
"female chengguan are like put," he said, and added, "but beyond that, you still have other responsibilities."
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the city, the district would not agree with this description
But gave to that in China größenvorgaben advertisements for affects both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to gesichtszüge uniform.
Whether that is synonymous with good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical corruptions need not apply.
"here we can unfortunately not lame or buckligen use," says Mr Zheng.
"their image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who is on the baoguang-platz near a monastery patroliert, 22, has apfelbäckchen and a geformten mouths.
They empfindetes not as sexist, that so great value on their appearance.
"You find, I see in this uniform sexy?" asks you, I mean look.
Her colleague with the grübchen, the 21-year Xu Yang, commented, "we have the task of representing the image of the city."
Their according to regret it the short end, not because it would have been more ambitious karrierepläne, than simply traders through the alleys to scheuchen, in order to prevent them on business.
Every morning, deals with the some remarks about twelve hawkers trying, on foot or on bicycle, as many as possible to sell rolls and tofugerichte before they are fortgejagt.
"Mr Wang, they disappear here please."
"We have them already said so many times," said frl. Xu a retailer who fled on foot and was using its on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche temporarily abandoned.
According to the officials of the activity is rather monotonous than arduous.
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, in the leisure vertriebswesen studied.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials which were not the dealer, as their male colleagues, must confiscate.
You can only criminals threatening, they have a male boss.
That should protect them against public harassment, which officials in China often suffer.
This year, hundreds of people rioted outside of, Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour circulated, chengguan-beamte had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and chenguan-beamte on the night of the incident were injured, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge upset or were set on fire.
Xindu remained of such violent incidents so far has been spared.
But unrest should not be excluded.
Just two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz, in which the female officials this morning patroulierten, about 50 people who gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorbike, which is contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a workshop was repaired.
The owner of cried raised a hue and cry.
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with cruel face the way to their cars and drove with the motorcycle and his owners.
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, stayed back. He was white, in order to be namensschild in order to remain anonymous.
As their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," said Mr Li well-balanced.
"most of the time, the people with the dispute."
Prosecutor Senator Ensign is not charges
Prosecutors in the justice department, have Senator John Ensign of the accusations, acquitted after his case with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband, a lobbying to win against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
This decision will put an end to the worst rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada, up to the scandal, the nationwide headlines and sparked a damper on his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator ensigns office, indicated that he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation "delighted."
The set up of the Senate, however, could still impose a disziplarstrafe.
According to testimony from ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that investigations against Senator Ensign have been drafted in this matter and that no further charges.
The Justice Department did not comment on the case.
The ruling was for many ethik-anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice came as a surprise. Their opinion there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying-verbot Ensign has disregarded.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times have been revealed, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election agent, to lucrative contracts, gave his silence about a case with hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign ensigns worked as treasurer.
Ensign, contact with few political friends in order to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogate them after he took over for the recruitment of hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam was, it was he was a year of no lobbying for his former employer, or the entire Senate.
According to the ethik-experten verstieß the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which in the case were chummy, against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie.
According to the published evidence "is, to all appearances a consultation and the violation of the drehtür-statuten," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, to the defence of clients, specialising in the sights of the government.
While the justice department formally rejected it, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to publicise, said Mr. fire and other ethikanwälten, the department notes to be very cautious in political charges after a series of defeats, the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of malfeasance on the part of the public prosecutor to drop.
Prosecutors "are clearly schreckhaft," said Melanie sloan, the chairman of the association ," citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim of combating corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts.
"This means that, in principle, high-profile officials now can assume that the law does not apply to them," she added.
Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a phone call to a public prosecutor and another on the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry has no complaints against his client will speak.
Mr. ensigns defender had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "in accordance with the law."
Mr. coggins refused, the legal arguments to the prosecutors, which he put forward to explain in more detail.
"I am not, in the gesprächsdetails between the Ministry and me to go. Only so much to be said: we believe that the right decision," he said.
Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the group to suspend, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz read.
The electoral Commission said it was not enough evidence that the money is anything other than a gift.
NV energy, a large firm in Nevada, which for a long time the senator supported, was one of the companies, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place.
An e-mail from the December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has got us nowhere, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he told him that he, the Interior Ministry for a cause, "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customers from Nevada, and allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, a meeting in the name of the airline to agree after this Mr. Hampton to lobbying had stopped.
Last year, for the first time, information about this affair to the public, Mr. Ensign is, make no apology to his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he is in the order of precedence of the Republicans in fourth place.
After many months, he no longer was struck, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he would seek a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign may no longer be the target of police investigations, "said his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, the ethics committee hope that very soon the example of the justice department, and his investigation einstelle.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada to continue," she said.
Cheshire-berufung power on Twitter carefully
Half a dozen of them tippten itself in the riots in the courtroom.
In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies.
In the end, so the defence, there was more than 140,000 twitter-meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a House, the flare-up.
On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was charged, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have been killed, an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, which the panel has ruled.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted proposals in court, the reasons for an appeal, and the outline of the courts in years.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that, by the intense coverage of the process, even through the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, swift penetration take details, so that the jury in an improper manner by the public outrage had been affected.
This protest could prompt the appelationsgerichte, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules will be necessary in the courtroom.
"as I have seen during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. influenced Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger.
The presiding judge Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected last week, the applications by ruling, briefly and succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades gerichtseinsprüche have found that the coverage of famous cases of doubt on the fairness of the process.
In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, who killed his wife would have to be lifted, and said in his decision, that it is because of the new media as a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom" had been made.
Some people believe that the TV show and the movie "on the run" on this crime is based.
Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the communication from the courtroom, the time of the fall of Dr sheppard were unimaginable to rules.
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in trials of the general public are persecuted, to be alarmed," said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, of the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report, it will be applied arbitrarily.
Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restrictions on a prompt communications from inside the courtroom could make the process fairer.
The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes outline for years, in order to discuss and thus a condemnation.
The defenders claim, for instance, that Mr. Hayes had already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances could be, as judge blue had not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed.
Some of the judges said that photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17, and michaela, 11 years, they would have with horror.
The defenders say that they would also carry the constitutionality of the death penalty in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly replaced a jury, which is a critic of the prosecution, and that he had been unacceptable pressure on the ruling, than he would have made the unusual decision, the panel had taken over the weekend to free.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of Governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidates.
They argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case would be reopened.
"such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has even beforehand in new haven and perhaps even have not yet seen a nationwide."
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are rabble-rousing but effective as reports, the slower are reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view was that the reporting on verarme future processes.
However, some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often with the argument, social and technical changes we need to give the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In her complaint, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the sentencing of Dr sheppard due to the coverage was rescinded and made it clear that the new media, new rules require.
"this case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness that which divides us?
After a campaign in schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy this week in Washington.
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before you can quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital is returning?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues, while the so-called "lame duck" session of the meeting, at the end of a period in which no decisions are being taken, had to employ.
After all, what one hears, it was neither a polite debate between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns.
The public meeting of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also to be civilised, despite the political differences between the Members will continue.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, a mutual respect creates, of the ideological divide, which still divides the Members, disguises.
That is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in one of the other signs of cooperation and conciliation, while it tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters, according to a new parteienkriegsführung weigh in.
Therefore, they were meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants to a minimum requirements or accusations, limited.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, that you as a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, one might expect.
Regardless of whether it is tax, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed.
"No question, the tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now for the "ethics and public policy center" works.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections are partisan passions, the die again.
And that is a good thing. "
In some issues, particularly in the ones on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
The Bush tax cuts will end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or even all, either temporarily or permanently.
It is also a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the favoured tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers to refuse to support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" session some and at the same time the new START Treaty can ratify.
But William glaston of Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily to a permanent cooperation must lead to the parties, if the new 112. Congress convened in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done, will have done, this short-term psychology in turn confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening in from today until 2012, when vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the intended by 2012," he said.
The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House to do so, and with the teeparty-wählern, who use their education.
How worried the Republican leader also that they may be, to instil fear high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and healthcare reform to stymie, adhere to them.
This parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly, which is a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reduce government spending.
The Deputy Chairman, Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles, one of the toughest jobs in Washington and have taken over, according to their own judgement, so very pressed the defizitfrage on the public agenda, that this could no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes, about their plan to make the official recommendation and they contend that only very close to this number.
The greatest opposition is in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health care system are challenging, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will this lead to change?
Public opinion.
It is a proven fact that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together.
If confrontation into a blind alley, as it happened in 1995, then both parties should take care to ensure the public reaction.
Whoever loses will be condemned to change tack and seek the compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic outlook.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time, to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
While at the same time, the activists from both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a far greater choice of rigour in 2012.
So may seen the courtesy which display this week, will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will be on both sides of a lot more effort, a common denominator in the questions, to find the two still be separated.
Durchgesickertes portrayed us-dokument Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it is a part of the bribes and of the schutzgeldes darlings, which you, to the Kremlin continues. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so they say.
They collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also of organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical of power" - takes its part of the money which the head to the top.
The memo, which, under the name of the ambassador John beyrle after Washington was broadcast on Tuesday by WikiLeaks published on its web site.
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited.
It was written while still of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that in the meantime, it would have been clearing up.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected charges of corruption for years, and he has won numerous verleumdungsklagen against such accusations.
In September he told a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty."
An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, which polls have shown.
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals will be called, and it is that this is addressed by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some people they describe as" disrupted "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat acts as a government," according to the memo.
"criminal elements" enjoy a kryshna " (a term from the world of criminal / of the mafia, what word for word" roof "or protection means), which is concerned about the police, the Stasi (FSB), the dienstaufsichtsbehörde (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as spread through the entire regierungsbürokratie Moscow.
Experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"least consequences of the ordinären criminal and the criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is a inkompetentes system, in which criminal groups in some areas, a gap is because the city offering no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the biggest firms from the police and the small business people were arrested.
A source says, "explained that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is best to include the protection of the MVD and FSB to receive (and not from the organised crime), since they are not only more weapons, resources and power as the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"This is the reason why the protection by criminal gangs, not more so, as asked in the past."
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, protecting themselves very modest no; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested.
The figures, which do not find their business very quickly - because of one or other under.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken of the need to fight corruption, but at the same time, he noted that little progress has been made.
The memo, the message contains descriptions of men who, with suitcases full of money, which probably were, in the Kremlin.
"in his fight against corruption must Medvedev to leave the bureaucrats," said Georgy satarov, director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without an opposition politicians, and without, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, by the corruption of Russia, will cost more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks at number 154 to a recent study on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence internationally (countries will be of "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the American embassy, which surely after Moscow time happened late, will certainly displeasure within the Russian Government, even though, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow can be blamed for the Kremlin, it also can be a way to claim that the problems of issues.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Robin Medvedev mentioned.
"The truth is that it is our interaction is an important factor in the internal politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such a pressure and so unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a weak betonierten schoolroom before pointed with dirty and abblätternden walls, recalls the director of anlong veng high school to the man who built it in the future, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he has taken to his people," said sreng kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughtermen," is the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge-hochburg in north-west Cambodia " s popular, where he built bridges, hospitals and infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still lives.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longstanding supporters in anlong veng.
In April allowed a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government of a schulbuch, the first time that children of former soldiers of the history of the Khmer Rouge told.
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal Cambodia and the UN for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, when the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, hindered their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said youk chhang, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation, which the regime.
"for them was the live under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is divisive even families."
During the Khmer Rouge reign over Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol pot-ied government overthrew fled the remnants of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
This widespread until December 1998, when the last movement, surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary guerrilla warfare from its base in the Western mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in anlong veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a crack through the UN peace accords in 1993, the first democratic elections in the country, have led to large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, to government, to hear what the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and nuan Chea Khieu Samphan and 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who was not given in 1999 by government forces in the dangrek mountains were arrested.
He died in 2006 in a prison in Phnom Penh, where he was at his trial.
As their benefactors they are no longer protected, the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the bring relief from grinding poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elitist official Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten because they kept their arms of all time, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, ill-educated peasants.
"These people have very little of the capitulation," said Sok leang benefited from the centre for justice and reconciliation across Cambodia, in anlong veng, also holds public forums.
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime."
"they grew up without any berufswissen."
Sor Lim, 55, who as a teenager in 1974, the rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle by anlang veng, before he niederließ in 1998 to a life of poor reisbauer.
"The live under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok everyone has something to eat."
"But now, life is difficult, because we must look to ourselves."
The current, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also brings concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, will seek the Court, Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, to court.
The mandate given to the Court, it is the old leaders and those who, mainly for the atrocities are responsible, to condemn them, but it is not to say whether it is on these four cases further actions will follow.
This has little contributed in anlong veng to alleviate fears.
Current media speculation have gathered in the chaem, 64 years, the during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s distriktchefin in the province had been manteay meanchey.

Belarus is in agreement, cannot continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama 's campaign to global security of nuclear materials, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels announced.
The US government had for years sought to persuade, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to gather last spring and seemed to have reached a hurdle.
But the US administration official told the Washington Post, that in the last two months, two secret agreement with Belarus have been made to 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt.
The folks on the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material - to remove, according to an official staff who, because of the sensitivity of the matter remains anonymous, roughly 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel of 47 nations" in April, the Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously well enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit in 2012.
"I was really impressed with the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel (by 2012) want."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government of six countries, helped her to get rid of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama 's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"how to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what is, fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not derive any dirty bombs and we will sell it on anyone."
"We use it solely for research purposes, this is everything."
Belarus, however, approached a few months ago in the United States, as there is interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte.
The first time round, the uranium Belarus in October to remove was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say.
It has been in a spezialzug load, the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the official.
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large proportion of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated, in order to build trust," the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the primary, which, at the global gefahrenreduzierung operates.
The James Martin Center for nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus in this year waffenfähhigen had at least 88 pounds of uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement his camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, first and foremost because of Lukashenko 's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggesting a possible rapprochement.
"the progress of this global security issues heißend welcome, the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No reservations of the Spanish Government against CIA
The Spanish Government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-qaida-gefangenen on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, such as from a telegram to the Ambassador of the u.s.a. in Madrid.

The deputy leader admitted the report of the Council, "said Zapatero met on the sidelines" and added, Spain have nothing to hide in this matter.
"de la Vega said, Spain have no objections to the geheimdienstflüge on Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre told cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador to point out that the Spanish Government "no great attention to this matter, in May, although the government had little influence, since this is in the hands of the judges when dealing with this matter."
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was in January 2007, for its part, the message, to understand that he is the judicial initiative, the deklassifizierung the documents from the Spanish geheimdienstzentrale (CNI) and the Defense Secretary on CIA flights to request would not block.
"these reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Yet the United States on the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German prosecutors "more concerned than about the deklassifizierte information of CNI and the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent untersuchern will be our efforts to discreet handling complicate between governments," Aguirre complained.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter, commented that "although the Spanish judge incredibly strong on their independence and are doing so as you see fit," he was giving instructions to his staff, "bloated rhetorical comments in order to avoid the tension abates."
The Ambassador also said his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"despite their generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that the PP will no doubt, from an indication that the government Zapatero 's actions of the USA, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignoring that will capitalise, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the Government of the United States could have an impact," he stresses.

Under this, the nickname by Klein on leads, does it with a kusine and at least one friend contact. Both come from noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.
The messages are from the year 2008.
In order to understand this, you need to know about her love life, the daily newspaper ABC, on the basis of evidence of their families.
The 30-jährige Galician Mrs began in 1998, a relationship with Iván túñez, an industrial.
She made a year ago.
Shortly after they disbanded, their relationship had been known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby was of him, but his former left him never to conduct DNA analysis.
Shortly afterwards it was already a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from lousame, a nachbargemeinde.
They lived with him for a long time.
César lived on them.
As the young woman on the Balearic Islands, in the labour market has remained around the small with their partners, even for a week to Palma.
But from the content of their news, their liebesbeziehung disintegrated and separated them.
In March 2008 she is alone in Minorca and writes: "Alberto is a very odd and annoyed, because I am here to work."
"When I told him, he found it well, but now he is obvious, of course, what it means, with the young the whole day to be alone and not free to be able to do what he wants."
Later, she mentioned a communication, which you on the mobile phone has received: "I would like to see you this month zurückkommst or sends me an address, to which I can send you the boys."

They declared that they will take their eldest, if all goes well.
"he will be the, in which he must be, that is, to me. I will never live in him again with someone else except for my mother," a dubious intention, if we take into account their poor relationship.

As she writes, it is assumed that the young, of the 1st of the month on the island and allegedly came on the 10th, was assassinated is dead.
"on the one hand, César, on the other hand, is not happy."
"on the one hand, he is here and I like the place to him a bit, but on the other hand, he must go to school every day."
She talks about a move to Mallorca.
"There will he (the boy) to attend a sommerkurs, so I have less expenditure on the Nanny."
On 17: memories and complaints.
"a riesenkuss of César, the asks me, when you kommst."
"Alberto is saying that he had any videos on the e-mail I sent. You see, if he wants, he finds me, so a manure."
On 30 still one: "the boy is doing well, he is in a sommerkurs in Catalan, to learn."
By Víctor, her current partner, there is a shooting: "he had me money."
On the Internet, in anime- and mangablogs, there are communications from her.
They even had their own blog on MySpace, which is now closed, and in which they muki ," the gefängnisentlasserin called."
"terrorism a la gallega (headline)."
The last man who, with her zusammenlebte, a vereidigter jagdaufseher, said to have any, because he felt guilty.
He may not catch everything that has happened, because they had not told him that she was a single mother.
Monica was yesterday by the Centre for gerichtsgefangene on Menorca into provinzgefängnis of Palma.
The officially appointed lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said they could not remember the expiry of the facts, "and they have not had the intention, the small damage."
Previously, it had, however, César stood in the bath and drowned his body in a suitcase verstaut.
Defense and prosecutors had requested a psychiatric assessment.
Councillor won four seats in Congress, and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a vital role in
After the major stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs in the last regional elections the PP has its sights on the parliamentary elections - or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections, is usually twice as high as the during the elections in Catalonia.
So did the Catalan people 's Party 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud.
Last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 votes.
If these rising trend - a result of the diversion of the stimmenanteils the PSC and the pegging of the electorate - should encourage the PP, analysts predict that the PP in the parliamentary elections the PPC of 8 to 12 congressmen could rise, while also ciu four (she now has 10) and the PSC will at least 9 members (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and the PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people " s Party would lose one of the members of the ERC - currently has three - while icv their members or could keep a will.
The wahlkalender should be maintained, however, is the next deadline with the local elections in May 2011. And then the people 's Party (PP) the tongues to be in the balance, the Socialist rule to an end, and in four provinzhauptstädten and with their majority in the City Council, one of the emblematic municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists as well as the people " s Party agree, the PSC, the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists did not achieve a majority on its traditional allies (ERC and icv) can exploit, will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party before their representation in the local council, in which they should reach 5% of the vote is going to lose.
The PP, recorded an increase in their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and could give to the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced the starring role in tarragonas reversal, we can play, where you had before the current mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign, she has, on several occasions.
Also in other important areas, such as, for example, in castelldefels reus badalona, or the people " s Party has been a significant increase.
Currently, the PP in 34 local authorities representing Catalonia, and they are seeking the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three other in Thailand
Seven of the policemen of the geheimdienststelle before the police arrested the Nigerians, Pakistanis and formed the of Thailand managed dschihadistische cell, the different Al qaida-gruppen, including "the movement for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and" laschkar e-Taiba " (let), the latter was author of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior has a great importance to these studies, which so far is that he assured with the "operation kampai" is the fälschungsapparat Al qaidas worldwide "weakened" and "so their ability."
The researchers estimated that in the two years ago, in which the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these have been falsified and then to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, have been discontinued, so that their "fighters" from the borders of European and other Western countries were able to cross.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe. That is why, apart from the Thai investigative bodies, other European police forces participated in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that it is in the area of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks such as this, the last Tuesday in Barcelona was carried out, will come from.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman Malik asghar, jabran, Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan Begum, tanveer arshad and the Nigerian babatunde agunbiade were arrested) was a further in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad athar flounder and zeeshan Ehsan flounder and the Thais sirikanlaya kijbumrung have been arrested.
They had come from Bangkok, in Spain and other European countries, led by local cell.
The Catalan network - a part of it was in the year 2009 has been destroyed - steel especially tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "international Islamic front."
This means that the documents for the names of men aged between 25 and 45 years to be issued and still had to be valid for several years; they were not permitted to visastempel.
In untersuchungskreisen underlines that, until now no links between the arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "laschkar e-Taiba" was one of the draw in Spain stolen and forged passports in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from through a geldtransfer-unternehmens several thousand dollars were sent out in the purchase of single for mobile phones were "invested," the later by the members of the "control" in the lives of 106 people were coming to an end, were used.
The police have seized an extensive documentation.
PP expects Mas postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, alicia sánchez-camacho yesterday, took the opportunity, Artur Mas personally their conditions to support his term as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. This is no different from the even during the election campaign and are provided with the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist unabhängigkeitsabenteuern, as a finanzausgleichsvereinbarung, the regionalistische leaders at the height of his mandate to propose.
The chairman of the Catalan people " s Party did to deal with the security of Artur MAS, who gave her the 18 Members, which they won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than sufficient, in order to feel indispensable. Because of the candidate of the bürgerlich-regionalistischen party ciu is reliant on at least one of the opposition parties abstained from the vote on taking up office, the voice.
The future alliances, which no doubt satisfies the regionalists in the next parliamentary elections in Congress want to comment on a possible Entente with PP. The discussions, the Mas to time with the other party leaders, however, turn to Catalonia.
As the leader of the PPC is concerned, it calls on that to support of the term "all discourse, the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia concern" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region, much like in the Basque country, and the leader of the ciu even a referendum, to be reconsidered.
Two political leaders is that they all have in common, the oversized political apparatus of the regional administration make lightweight and the level of inheritance and gift taxes geschenksteuer wish to abolish.
With the details of the negotiations for the office of MAS, deal from the PPC Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced a crackdown on the opposition - and Joan Herrera (icv). Today he is with Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan laporta (solidaritat catalana).
The altenpflegeheim reaffirms that the deaths not on "a lack of action" are due
The owners of the altenheims in olot close, not from their carers on eleven elderly people killed
The leaders of the altenpflegeheims la caritat in olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which she highlighted the damage the criminal actions of Joan Vila dilmés - the nurses, who during his work at least eleven of old people, for which he was responsible, had killed the establishment - had caused.
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, was accompanied by his lawyer, Joan cañada in court and announced, "la caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) charges," but "the right and our liability oblige us to the process and the civil liability."
The establishment must be not only a social being discredited, because they accept the criminal actions of the pflegers not realised in time, but now also repay a high figures of the rechtsvertretern the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crime in August 2009 and has since continued that he was murdered.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the altenpflegeheims - because he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities due to their age and disease were handled by telephone.
The head of La caritat verneinte this point and flatly declared that "lack of action keinerzeit the reason for the incidents could have been."
The lawyer of La caritat added that it "in the dispute no indications for negligent actions, a person other than the defendant."
The Union already as "angel" confessed to the 11 murders and explained that the first crime perpetrated on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have murdered.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La caritat said access to the medicines of the staff was very difficult to control.
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail suspended the carers in six of nine crimes, patients with the death of her suffering.
But the results of the laboratory, whether it be Vila is lying and for his first victims actually have a less cruel death or whether he chose this from the inside ausbrannte, by offering them bleichlauge verabreichte, as it is, according to the confession in three of the women had done, he between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat listens to the testimony of the pflegers no faith, not even on the number of murders, a subject which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements in court, and that it had made no sense, though its approach after eight successful murders suddenly to be changed.
They say that it is for this reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the justice system available.
To kowtow to threatening language of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet warned of "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to."
The spreads are the euro-peripheriländer increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB can deceive, and the euro has appreciated hardly points, which led to the concern, not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses are recovered, however, as a result of the closure of a short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors is still a long way from his fears.
Today, a month ago urged the European Central Bank on us, our liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, which states that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many more times in the future, have to make a U-turn.
The Bundesbank has called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. There should be only a einwöchiger indefinite access will be maintained.
After the irland-krise, we hope that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March" extended invitations to tender and the quarterly unlimited access on quartalsende to provide liquidity until at least June to be maintained.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued, and a stärkendes signal will spend.
If the expectations are not met, the excellent response from the markets yesterday thrown back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, can only God help us!
Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May, the Bank confirmed the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to take into account and then the markets collapsed, could this history to repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistently.
In May showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they, too, by which they have bought a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year staatstiteln in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28%, compared to 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates fell in Portugal by 30 basis points across the entire curve and reflected a wahrnehmungsveränderung the markets after the words Trichet 's.
In Ireland were the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is to approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible further estimated 15 000. There is time until February, private capital or to obtain these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests in July had not recognized, the figures are within the framework of the recovery plan is acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must next Tuesday the parliamentary approval for his new budget. As they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has their discourse in relation to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity, asked to show that we share the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries of the Beethoven " s Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister, yesterday the plan of action, which on Friday is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation schemes. The measures in the ears of investors such as vivaldis four seasons.
The twin effect of Mr Zapatero and Mr Trichet, explains why the Spanish stock market by 4.5 per cent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared with February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise result.
Today there is a crucial auction of three-year bond, the benefits from the trichet-effekt. That is why we are in a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit will eliminate.
For Spain, which would be to request a plan of aid a self-sacrifice.
We would maintain liquidity, we do not need. The Treasury has made available EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March, interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should Caesar " s wife must comply with the motto: "Now is not only that, but also appearances."
Only courage, that we create!

That is the background to the cause, about which the judges in the confirmation hearing for the treatment of the challenge, for which no date has yet been set, to decide.
Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Red Bull since 2004 in the world of Formula 1 is moved their history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid much attention to the newcomer, and despite his sharply rising track record over the last few seasons and the final set, last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilots and champion Sebastian vettel or the performance of the motors of downgrade Renault to want, is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands of, and thus a siegerteam created to become legend.
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate of litigation, the German company in 2007 for purposes not with motor race have to do, on the market.
This as plm informatikprogramm was called for the development of montageketten in factories around the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used.
Question is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this really will be constructed so errors and to avoid unnecessary costs.
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and the tests are observed, and can carry out.
Russwurm reveals that in 1992, in the rennställen an average of ten engineers working in a season than three or four improvements could introduce.
In red bulls team are currently 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful do they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the rennwagen through.
The siemens-manager said the plm-software was in the situation, all elements of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and to improve, with the exception of the motors, exclusively responsible for the Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamik and altered the safety elements.
The changes may thanks to advanced production facilities and hightech-autoklaven within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulators in reality.
The only border, this insane technical perfect is set, the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 racing - for his race team in a season can spend.
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen 50 kilometres from London in a remote location.
It is two buildings in which visits - particularly of journalists - are severely circumscribed.
Everything that is happening there is top secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion vettel and mark webber.
But red bulls true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy-drink-hersteller in the service of his participation in the race tracks, hiding other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is nil.
The technologichef of the plant, Steve nevey, stressed that, five years ago, you could say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50 per cent for the victory and earned the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber by computer can never be replaced, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years, a million customers' grip?
The managing director of Banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, and he believes that in 2001 a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity and predicts the end of the schuldenkriegs.
Still, he sees a drop in the zinsspannen ahead, which the banks with increases in fees and the price of loans to try to compensate.
Sabadell expected in three years, a million people - a salvage to existing fields.
Sabadell has found the way, the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment, to survive.
The Bank will introduce a new dreijahresleitplan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive, without the public support from the frob, but beyond that, the market share of around a million customers - 700 000 if the customers, which the Bank will lose increase. This is the great challenge before this bank, because until now it was their business customers more attention than their individual customers.
This year it has 250 000 and 50 000 dollars retail companies.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of geschäftsplans 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, in other words, austerität, reducing costs. The challenges facing the Bank so that, together with imagine it will have.
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times to publish targets and, as the financial crisis around the world, all the plans of the banks are in disarray.
Sabadell is in this year of their master plan that were established four years ago, optima. This was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the state of the market, it was a financial year.
The customers, the savings banks, are due to leave are the main objective of the Bank.
At a breakfast organized by the apie stressed by guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great scope."
The manager expects Spain would only "slowly" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult," in two or three years "to create work" - vital for the survival of the banks.
Even if he calculates that the war of liabilities - of the zinsmargen punished - will abate, the risk premia, the banks and building societies for their emissions by paying to preserve liquidity, to compensate for sagging profit margins already in the price of loans themselves.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are of a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have not turn off the tap off, but the zinsdifferenziale are very high," guardiola.
BANESTO on Thursday the order was already on its filialnetz from, the awarding of long-term loans and the zinsdifferenziale (cf. cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged a, the banks tended to have the stategie currently, "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, corporate transactions.
Not in vain he assures that, in Spain, more companies are "necessary."
"in the coming year will change anything," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "huge increases" and does not rule out that some of the Spanish financial institutions in red numbers are sliding.
He is of the opinion of the kaptitalaufstockungen frob could replace the monetary market.
After he assured that sabadell a temporary closure of the markets could survive, it weakens the argument of some bankers, which already has a new liquidity crisis predict.
He stressed that nothing can be in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, can be short-term financing on repogeschäfte and so that the crisis interception.
CECA includes a second wave of mergers of savings banks from
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility that there could be a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
As the concentration of the Spanish savings banks, several building societies began there in the first phase will not to participate. They retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes (CECA), José Antonio olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the biggest part of the merger is completed. The inclusion of cajasol in the group of Banca cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"the biggest part is finished, it may be that we siebzehen instead of 13 or 14, but all the important processes are already complete. They were of Banco de España, all transactions has strongly supported, controlled."
In one of the Association of directors and managers aragoniens (adea) organized breakfast olavarrieta, led from the concentration process "as quickly as possible, has taken place and that we need to be satisfied with the prompt expiry, in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been set," he said.
"the transition from 45 building societies with an average of 28 000 million vermögensbestand at 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much larger, with which we have met the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta, said "there is a series unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the unseriösität and absurdity" revealed because "Banco de España exhorted us, made before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain, one of the rigorosesten funding systems of Europe, and "perhaps" around the world have and added that those who anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge" would.
The manager has said that we are in the current economic climate has "no worries" about the situation of the financial institutions, and the savings banks, which have to make a "very significant" concentration have gone through, "as quickly as possible," will happen.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks the stress tests, the ECB in July, have been very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has, for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union.
The tension on the markets have a two-fold response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reliefs for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of the agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit, and the privatisation of 49 per cent for aena, the management of airports, particularly Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, along with the current crisis herausbeschwört said.
How are these events?
It is anticipated the Merkel 's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
In Germany, is a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, the one with the maintenance of the old traditions of so many of his partner.
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South to leave the euro area should have been.
The second: the restoration of the German mark - although at the moment, sounds more like science fiction, supported by a large proportion of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population.
The third: a review of the euro in accordance with German proposals. That means that more macroeconomic control; rigorous financial management; punishment of the countries which exceed the requirements of möglichereweise; the failure of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time. That is why there is now no excuses.
First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German Government is a constitutional reform drew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016.
It was the first signs of the drift between what Germany was thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign suspended the Central European country, when Merkel announced the decision to save Greece painful serious.
At the time, the heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen with an unambiguous position. It calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time the private lender, to commit a part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything the following.
But its proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013 that should enable us to participate.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures need to be made - it from that date, the old ways of the euro will not be.
The geburtsjahr 2013 will be a new currency zone, in which the force countries severely punished, that can be forced to declare itself insolvent and, in this case, the private sector a portion of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a hard path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative in the debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as it was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would be wrong to do so, it is not understood.
It is not only a question of the budget deficit by 2013 runterzufahren at three per cent.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat.
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm.
And that we need the opportunities offered to us, be offered until spring 2013 will use.
It seems that Zapatero also has understood, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, right in their own House, to create their way.
But the of Germany want red line is there, and it does not seem that things would change.
Among the possibilities is taking into account the fact that we, the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out.
In this case Germany might still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and regelumgehung
Tricks such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a penalty.
The supposedly of two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) proposed exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink has been shed, about whether it is a unsportliche action or not and whether any both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a couple of minutes to go (your team had already won clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group, the two players would be the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against auxerre and so without playing cards in the next spielphase.
Finally, the disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José mourinho, with two to play and the players involved with various sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - is visible rules.
Part of the debate about the fact that outlined case that a team from the football clubs, Real Madrid (who, in his anthem edelmut and honor claims and on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents), and the key role played in the drama by mourinho, the more an episode to its long history as theatralischer and provocative engineers has added.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly of the statutes of illicit behaviour runs counter to the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter should be of the sporting spirit ailment being investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the challengers, an aspect that, through these actions was not at risk, because it was not aggressive play.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the force the players an unfair advantage from the gegenteam. This was not done.
The paradox of the plot of the players of real Madrid is that they do not match up to what we normally regard as falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken place, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be so visibly as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sanction to go.
Another question is, what kind of advantage the ban from the deliberate fouls.
Here, it should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has yet been brought advantages for the feigned game were erheischt because, the obvious result of this action was that their own team with fewer players had to play.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club has not then on these players.
The advantage is obviously the players that the next spielphase of the Champions League without playing cards, their participation in a future game could begin to threaten.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, since the team eventually could exit. Moreover, players with this approach to a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus about where they are because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle of exit.
That is not so clear is whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately settle such practices are not against the sporting spirit, which also include strategic decisions, the rules in order to derive maximum benefit.
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more, when you choose this.
They made a strategic decision, without a penalty saved, before her, or to flee.
Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blur is, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the regelübertragung unprovoked.
The damage of the principles of the sport by these actions inflicted is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
Angebotoffensive to kundenfang for gruppen-weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year is a flood of reservations on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The paid employees even celebrate from broad. They do not want to take more than 20 to 30 euro spend.
As the turrón and the weihnachtslotterie is there in the run-up to the gruppenabendessen again, the hotel and freizeitgewerbe oxygen before justice. But as a result of the economic crisis you resolve a preisoffensive from the kundensegment, too, that the great mass, salvage: almost all of us want to between 20 and 30 euros for a mittag- or spend dinner, confirm the respondents entrepreneurs and associations.
So that the accounts have a bit more complicated, the calendar (Sylvester falls on a Friday) all orders in the week from 13 December drop, with the result of a flood of reservations of dinner for two spitzentager (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before that.
Since 2008, when the bad times, many companies have started the gruppenabendessen recruited for budgetary reasons.
In order to give this tradition of not having to pay workers, many of them from their own pockets.
As the economy, it is also increasingly being called niedrigstpreise confirms the chairman of the gaststättengremiums of Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the umbrella until now dare not predict, such as the festivities this month will be.
"The people are considering" dozens of times before they set aside ."
"They would like to be, but they respect heavily on prices," he says.
The transaction will go well, "in which the quality at good prices, with a good offer service," he added, and calls to remind us that the clients, in times of crisis, which is why prices in order to save EUR 25 most demand.
In a survey in various Central restaurants transpires that the evening of 17 December 2008 the broadcaster to collapse.
The Group soteras says the demands for this Friday, with the intention of less than EUR 30, would spending boom. The group has its menüs with komplettangeboten between 25 and 35 euros in the economic cycle is adapted.
Another leading group, andilana, the 16 restaurants in the city (maintains hostal de la Rita, market, La Fonda and others), has the oddity of the calendar early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have to do the impossible, for the vorjahrespreise with menüs for every taste of 19,95 until 30 euro," he says.
In the El to grup, mussol, ququ attic, and a total of 23 local, then you lose sight of the optimism, not since the second quarter of the revenue is flourishing again and good, if too few days focused on prospects for the weihnachtsgeschäft just.
Sources of the group, also highlight that the 18 a überaktiver day with freundesgruppen Christmas vorfeiern, will be.
The six gruppenmenüs was a weihnachtsmenü for 30 euros, or more than preishit. It has added to the impression that the customers are willing, 10 percent more than in the previous year and spend in return for more details, such as, for example, cava.
Also in some firms you see green shoots grow, which is why the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the gruppenessen back on the upswing.
On the part of the umbrella fecasarm (with associations such as the kneipen-, catering sector and freizeitverband of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, enric gomà to the end of the tunnel and noted that the total reservations right "lively," even though the customers' make a maximum ."
The fun on celebration is not, however, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear program attracted a great deal of concern in the United States
Islamabad is nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Revelations of WikiLeaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The video-sharing website WikiLeaks revealed by the content of the correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan, and the us-staatsabteilung confirmed the concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program, Washington.
On the edge of the informative and hefty details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, these offer revealing that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety is not strengthened, but in reverse "is decreasing," and that the fragile Asian country more nuclear weapons "to a rhytmus faster than any other country."
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are made up, but their wreckage is stored in a possible attack their destruction - to make it harder for Washington to cause sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, said: "in the vicinity of some nuclear installations by the Taliban attacked the area, the presumptive verstreuung of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number, in which the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes are implies, is no longer only by the United States, but also of Russia as ausufernd and reason for caution.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges personnel to guard nuclear facilities; to stop because of the low educational and cultural level have extremist organisations more people involved in nuclear or rocket programmes which represent, reklutieren contribute to," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the of Julian assanges website revealed documentation is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation wanes and the increased pace in which Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, from an Office of the message, that the communication with Pakistan as a "frustrating," said: "There are often no transparency; on the assistance we receive no replies or they will be rejected."
In another report confirms Peter lavoy, officials of the state intelligence service for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country."
The Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit to the Supreme heeresleiters, General Ashfaq Kayani, the people responsible "clarify" that "Pakistan army its tacit support to terrorist groups."
On the hunt for WikiLeaks head
Obama appoints a high is responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations.
Interpol has a red warning to monitor and detect Assange has.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, jullian Assange has generated, is a complicated maze in which is difficult to explain the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "detect and pursue" of Assange has.
However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It also has nothing whatsoever to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but to do with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians are in Sweden.
It also assures the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they contact with Mr Assange has."
Already on 20, the international police body, with headquarters in Lyon (France), at the request of the orders from Sweden, but it was up to yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities have not been known.
As is the case. Interpol-länder are the 188, Assange has instructed to identify and locate, "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol for the arrest of a of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders to consider a number of Member States, according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - of the national police forces must be carried out, particularly if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange has probably.
The approach is causing assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which you about it, the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is prepared by videoconference, the issues of the Swedish authorities to answer.
They also recall that Assange has the departure from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, the with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy Beria pavlovich, head of security of Stalin, compared to the corresponding received approval.
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son, Assange has asserted in an unknown location on, but not in silence.
On Monday, he was the head of the magazine time via Skype from an unspecified location. In an interview to the conversation, he called for the resignation of the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for the organisation of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and in breach of the United States has signed international agreements, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was the Pope yesterday from the White House, Robert Gibbs, condemned the proposal to resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a type with a website should show," he told the broadcaster CNN.
Obama himself has a high is responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell Travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen.
The attempt by the spokesperson of the präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange has to pay less attention, stands in contrast to the views of the Conservative politicians and commentators on these days.
Congressman Peter King from January, the Chair of the national sicherheitskommitee will lead the House of Representatives, has asked the staatsabteilung to study the possibility of WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to put their money to seizures, and each of you support or a contribution to follow."
Tom flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange has had to be withdrawn "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and a not bemanntes plane or so what use."
Anyone who has not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"it always was, the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution, is eiine too lenient sentence," he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leader of the Party of having a secret ballot on his continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips before.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe, for the umpteenth time an internal rebellion in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members, and half of the vote richtungslosen ERC out of the way to go.
The leader is aware that his threat of resignation to the close of the former Labour Party Whip, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor itself and he is not the same headaches will spread, like other former currents.
That is why the leaders tried by Esquerra with a nod to the new critics, to win what his position until the next local elections.
For the early yesterday announced that, in the more than 200 regional Council members of ERC over stay in office secret could express.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the carodisten the präsidenen wanted to miss a parking ticket, you could do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division, as well as the of subjection to avoid his person.
In several interviews, he stressed that he would, with half of the vote plus one not vindicated, and he added prozentwerten added, without giving a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be a good thing.
The Carod close by the President, calling for more than just the party of his office available. An inadequate gesture, since puigcercós the supreme body of the congresses controlled.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance of ministerial resignations, you will have with the board of a policy plan from now until May.
Expect them to show you, in the drafting of the document on strategic review, that the leadership on 18 of the Council will put to the vote, to be able to participate.
Their intention is to guarantee for puigcercós. In return, these promises, the Congress in the fall of 2011, the leader of what is already a fact.
The leader of the ERC believes the "polyphonie" a pity the stability and wants once and for all, the organisation in the situation, to bring their dirty linen wash behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, the President-in-Office of the conseller Josep huguet in his blog has signed, symptomatic.
In the light of the puigcercós is an ideologue, gave the holders of innovació it for a fact that the party leaders "in exchange for various objectives" will be supported.
He was five, two of which are in the forefront.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from carods environment.
The second could be great news.
Huguet proposes, ERC should begin to abandon the vollversammlungsprinzip than functioning.
So he verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should enable the congresses with elected delegates.
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is puigcercós' team, which has in the past two congresses fought obsessively.
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a Congress, dealing with the reform of the statutes, should look.
This date is still out, because infogle the internal aufruhe of recent years to address that this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors on the wings, could be the time to return to this matter and for always.

Obama is in Twitter for the law in favour of a undokumentierter students.
"If you ask for the adoption of the dream act - a law, then call your senators and urge them to the adoption of this law," twitterte, President of the United States in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the dream act - a law to legalise undokumentierter students with a news on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you ask for the adoption of the dream act - a law, then call your senators and urge them to the adoption of this law," twitterte Obama.
His SES II contains a cyberlink to a broader document, which calls on the public, unterzüglich with their senators to contact, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"with your voice, to which we are waiting for is the time to listen to you," he says.
The news was widespread after the 42 Republican Senators androhten, all vote for any legislation, but to block the extension of the tax reliefs from the times of Bush and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, in one of the 42 Republican Senators signed letter was announced, might have on the vote of the dream act - law and other projects, such as the ratification of the new start-abkommens with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans to the law, the dream act and other projects, the präsidentschaftssprecher interviewed, said Robert Gibbs, he trust that, once the steuerthema was resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be set up.
"I believe we still have a lot of time..."
"All we agree that the steuerangelegenheit must be carried out before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement at all times, and then we will be able to plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, "he would make the vote at the end of the debate," so that the dream act - a law with which the initiative for the legalisation undokumentierter students from next Thursday in the Senate could be voted on, although the next week, would be more likely.
The version of the dream act - a law or the law of the American dream would roughly 800 000 young people, who immigrated to the United States, as they are not yet sixteen years old, were during the last five years have lived in this country, and a higher educational institution or enrolled in the army, are legal.
But the supporters of the bill need 60 votes for passage of the initiative, which is why they have the votes on a handful of Republicans are dependent. At the time of the organisations of the advocates of this project an intensive involvement in the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the dream act, have 58 seats.
However, said one of them, the senator Ben Nelson of nebraska, he would vote against it, and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced its support of the law.
So it must be the defender of the dream act several Republicans on their side, if other democrats should decide to turn our backs on the initiative.
Among the most experienced Republicans are from Maine, Olympia snowe and Susan Collins, and the Senator George lemieux of Florida, the mandate of the senator Mel Martinez took over.
Other Republicans, who in the past, supported the dream act, orrin hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they have said on another occasion, it is no longer to support.
Another Republican who had voted for the bill, John McCain, his position has not yet been set.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the dream act in the Senate before the biggest obstacles.
With literature the finger on the wound
The second round of 'the mood in the language of "was a walk, in which the participants for the narrative made strong
"with the sex in the language, I understand that, yes, but... the finger on the wound? What will expects from me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua 'open, a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and on that occasion the subtitle of your question (used to a different event was the round table the sex in the language, she said).
The finger on the wound... "brings us in difficulties," spuckte the Argentine schriftstellein sweet the audience, which consisted mainly of young people, on the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (fil) to this by marisol Shultz moderierten round table, to attend the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra montero and Luis García montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela Las a text which they celorio Gonzalo dedicated the Shultz, and later as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in the first person and is a champion on the search is to know what a "wound" is, and from doctor to doctor, of which they have no answer, but evidence for the guide their narrative.
The infektologen leaves you satisfied: "patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, it is in the middle of the track raubte breath, and her but declared that wound is not a scientific term, enthült the psychoanalytiker the secret: "The wound that is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and does that make it easier for you "from the wound only learned that it was open and really did not exist." But she is convinced that the mood of the language and whose fall mix themselves.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with two.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise the invention', and in that of the finger on the wound is not mentioned, but will be discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism he tells of a famous zauberin, who touched the clouds, far gereiste men or was by a girl lost virtue restored. The narrative made a U-turn and reported of America, the great novel, the it from the outset, not by his own journalists was missing, and he cites Bernal Díaz del Castillo, of the abundance of the eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (the writer), spottete invited the false witnesses, as outlined in the true stories emerged, but in other ways, the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, even the shame has disappeared."
However, stresses that "it is the crazy and liar, which are the best things" to imagine, and there are coming closer to reality and to lie to each other, where we no longer know what side of the narrative, where the fictitious literature reached the summit.
He calls the real 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, to be told what."
As Mayra montero was commenting on the series, and the writer praised the diversity of interpretations, including the invitation of the fil to the round table 'of the finger on the wound' had contributed.
The kubanerin and puertorikanerin devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence which affects their country - as the whole of Latin America, as a result of the fighting for control of the drugs trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs, a tacit, not deliberate contain commitment," she said, after she had highlighted that literature communications and binding is between authors and readers, like in a "chemical reaction."
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García montero, whose contribution was also, "This finger of the committed writer in the wound of the author of" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-moving world also the intellectual habits and the control of awareness on dogmatism and forgotten, "behind every confirmation that a small no is behind every denial and a small yes."
"to be in possession of our thoughts and the reality, we need to be clarified, and clarified often signify the finger on the wound and to those to trouble, which is much more comfortable, if you are in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuances, and also the powerful to harass, who prefer the world in black and white behind schedule and has said he was invited to rediscover the meaning of the letter.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in endspielen back, he has staunchly and ABS in his career, and three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final are also two different from their respective trainers set styles, and their conflict class of meeting is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in endspielen back, he has staunchly and ABS in his career, but he has had three crucial games, and so far he has done well, and this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentines, with the coin to the second champion played, he is one step behind the victors and, amazingly, he has been with the same team consecutive endspiele.
The santistische strategist, the first final as coach of the 'torneo apertura in 2002, when del morelia the reins in the hands, with whom he had against toluca 4-2 with a big defeat learned; later, in the' clausura 2003 ', he reached the decisive match, which he also with 3-1 against rayados lost.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'torneo bicentenario 2010', in which she played against Los diablos, rubén again had a setback, as the game with a 2-2 against Los choriceros after 210 spielminuten was undecided, but the penalty kick he came with 3-1 ahead and received two possibilities, plugging his title, but ultimately misguided three of his players the 11 steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén already had two endspiele with the diablos rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, lost. That is why he would not again be pursued by the accident and the evil of witchcraft, in order to free the first time, a title to celebrate, although he confirmed that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break any statistics, it is for a club, for my affection that I hingebe, and that is why the title will come to see me, but what has happened previously, is the most important thing," commented the helmsman, when asked about the lost endspiele.
The last end game is still strong, he stayed, he assures, learned a lot from it: "the only lesson we can draw from this is that, until the referee is not the end, when we cannot celebrate on the line, we are prepared for the players, too, because the last time we were with two elfmetern already prepared, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series will be decided by penalty could not concerned him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty, we would like to finish in the regular spielzeit, but sometimes there is no alternative and they must be prepared in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of anxiety or the intense desire to be the title already in the hands of that left us with something for this final, and we hope that this time it will not be made."
It is in romanso power, not only the second to be champion and the first glory at a cost to the title.

The clandestine immigration could easily be prosecuted
The bill, the Conservatives, according to the government, the problem of with hidden immigrants landing ships is intended to regulate, is expected to be eingestampft, after the three opposition parties on Wednesday have announced that they cannot support the proposal.
"I am strongly opposed to this Charter '.
"I think with a party, which tied them to their feet," said Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the Liberals, after the expiry of the weekly caucus-sitzung before the assembled members.
The Liberals were saying that the draft law, which allows each one to the transport of illegal immigrants seeschiff next person identified up to a year, so as to violate proposed the Canadian legal and freiheitsverfassung.
Gilles duceppe, leader of the bloc québécois, also indicated that the bill is not able to support when he opposed the wrong target group turnaround.
"We are against this and it seems that, for all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait to see what the government is doing," said M. duceppe.
The criticism regarding the immigrationsfrage of Olivia Chow, NDP, the critics of the dismissed the request, their party is not firm enough behaved towards the hidden immigrants.
"The neo-demokraten agree that it is taking measures against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying, through another bill, the c-35 to enforce," Chow said.
We are in favour of the bill, the Conservatives because he is not, therefore, that the blame lies with the refugees and children seeking at least a year for prisoner, "Chow said.
The immigration minister Jason kenney accused the opposition parties, with the policy to play and the will of the Canadians to ignore.
"The Canadians share the honourable Members to stick with that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine immigration, this criminal transactions, Canada, and the country as a doormat treat."
"They expect Canada tough measures," the response of ministers kenneys.
"The government has no confidence vote on their bill, announced that the country would be able to lead to elections, which the government rejected.
A conservative, has, however, told the Agency qmi, praised the government would be a vote, so that every Member in immediately to declare his constituents.
The new body is no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, our unity in the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public committee of inquiry into this subject.
Robert dutil, Minister of public security, claimed this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec could have been last January, the New York department of investigation, consulted on this issue.
The metropolis has since 1870 over a unity against corruption.
However, the announcement of Wednesday, more than just a surprise.
You have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert dutils not in the slightest.
There was also not that Stéphane bergeron, critic and a Member of the Parti québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "gezaubertes rabbit from the hat" and "in a will rightly gebastelte solution" qualified.
Minister dutil had in turn help to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the future of unity was possible.
"It will be the result, if we are announcing," therefore, it is.
"We are aware of this problem."
According to réjean parent, the President of the csq, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest, insists on education, we want to prevent this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to set up a committee of inquiry, is able to form the resignation of Jean Charest, for its part," said Yves boisvert, a teacher for ethics and politiksysteme at the ENA (staatl. College for the training of senior governor).
In order to escape from this impasse, he proposes the Quebec, the finanzprüfungskontrolle a specific mandate, so that these about corruption and secret agreements relevant inquiries.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the prüfungskontrolle," he said.
He also takes the view that the Quebec the prüfungskontrolle the same power as Commissioners could give, which she also would allow the people to the statement.
The formation of a unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec Ottawa will also demand to the penal code in order to respond better to this type of crime to be stopped.
This demand from the public prosecutor of the operation marteau, the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the administration of justice in this kind of prosecution is unclear.
Vic Toews, Minister for public security, in turn, confirmed, his colleague from the justice, rob Nicholson, are currently with certain of this dossier to revise concerned.
During the operation printemps in 2001, the groups of the motorradpolizisten was concerned, there were 131 people have been arrested, although the penal code has not been revived.
Ottawa has, as a result of the law against gansterism prevailed.

Dupont is partly reprimanded
The rundfunkmoderator quebecer Stéphane has a Dupont before the Canadian board for rundfunknormen (ccnr) because of his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians, as well as for his ausfälligen way of talking about Funk a partial setback.
The ccnr believes Mr. Dupont is choi and his 98,1 fm-team should have the right to own expression, however, would have been certain statements "inaccurate information about the welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians and also such a ungehobelte expression, which contain the daytime television broadcast is not adequate."

The consequences for the radio stations, including his decisions during the prime time viewing unique within a period of three days, had to say, are slightly.
A king of the kung-fu in Montreal
Nacereddine zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has a very special course.
The athlete, who in "sanda" (vollkontakt kung-fu), in the kickboxen and in to make thaiboxen, is now in the search for new challenges on the tatami and in the boxringe in the world.
"I did 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxen started," said zemmal, since 2008 in the metropolis is located under the professionals.
Personally, I find the battle continues, since, for those who work the bodenkampf, such as the joint kampfkünste present may not, competitions in North America are scarce. "
The recently had his label working as a security agent, and in the company employees, its rival UPS complained of bad news, in which he gave in between 23 and 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland, ausgetragenen World Cup of the charge of two gold medals from the world karate and kickboxing Association (wka) won.

450 million in contracts without competition
Hydro-québec, mutual understanding projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert hydro-power project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 treaties a consortium, consisting of the firms bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, the main proportion, namely, the projektleitung, to a value of $295 million without invitation to tender has been received.
This consortium, called "énergie gérance" in 2004, has as a corollary of the decision from hydro-québec, the private sector of their responsibility for this important, hydroelectric project in equivalent of a sum of $5 billion to set up myself.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without there being a public invitation to tender had been made.
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, the the risk of the wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and overcome the competition."
"This means that rather than abgekartete games rather than on secret way is now being investigated in a more open form," said yesterday Sylvain simard, a Member of the PQ, at the press conference.
Early in the morning simard had the issue before the national assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the interests of the public in this way can be served.
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had responded by the afternoon, they vehemently deny, that this Treaty is a stitch-up, would have acted.
"I am sticking to my line," lashed out, by the PQ confirmed, was "dishonest" and it "lacked rigour."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ is sorry.
The model of the consortium is common practice in the world.
It is usually a temporary order such temporary alliance which it two or more companies, allowed their expertise on a requirement for a tender for a complex project.
The project "eastmain" has a high komplexitätsniveau relating to its arbeitsausmaßes.
The construction techniques is under way and should be drawn up until 2012.
Despite this, it was awarded the contract without competition had can take place; there had been negotiations.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even on a relatively simple projects by no means an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir published "last week, is noted in the field of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium has been the subject of regierungsermittlungen.
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows, more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of persistent duration.
In this way, for example, the firm Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten, + Cima, génivar, snc-lavalin or even Roche and tecsult count, together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person, namely in Dessau.
What the consortium "énergie gérance," normandeau Minister stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec to this fact and that since the 1970s in a particular way and bill heap."
Réal laporte, the big employers of the Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (sebj), has issued a statement on the nose, so the fact that the Treaty on the projektleitung after agreement was approved.
"If you ask a tender power and there are only a few candidates, will your prices to soar."
"You have two possibilities: either you nimmst the people on this Mart and you are saying: you will be a satisfactory agreement to negotiate a good price."
"The idea is not, however, that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," added laporte.
This the consortium "énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois $received.
The Treaties have been either of the hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
After review, one of the newspaper, "Le Devoir published" more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the companies or their branches, including, in particular, ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 were allowed.
Snc-lavalin had 22 contracts in itself gerafft, génivar had 16, 14 and 10 tecsult Dessau, without their participation in this, "énergie gérance counting."
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
It is estimated the entire on 783 344 $449, including the Treaty with "énergie gérance" about 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm axor) and the "Parti libéral du Quebec well known."
Minister normandeau had suggested, the PQ is equally associated with the firms that they "funded," before they specify that they are, rather, its managers.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not inspire me with confidence
Green, but quite frankly sceptical.
The quebecer consumer has little trust at the centre of sustainable growth, but also to the troubled brands or the öko-kennzeichnungen, which taxes its choice.
It is a pity, though it is applied in a universe where we are in favour of a responsible manner by information consumption so teeming with only: the barometers responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about a deficiency, which is putting the brakes on his commitment displayed power as the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although the consumption of the so-called socially responsible products in 2010, seem to have pushed forward the quebecer, however, those who sell them, try to pay tribute to little credit.
Two thirds of the population to quebecer is, in fact, the matched the firms nor to believe as the Greens, the unternehmenswerbung instilled by the responsible consumer centre of the University of sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Another diagnosis: half of consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official, to the supposedly fair products attached certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which have proven to be a closet, so the scoreboard.
Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only 14.6% of quebecer population seriously.
The information about responsible consumption appears important to stimulate this konsumsegments, which currently only by nearly a third of the quebecer consumers.
In fact, dämpften empty and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is after the higher price of the product, the second part of the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, there is a third of the quebecer of the performance of green products and services, you have to put in the effort, with mistrust.
According to another report has already had more than half of consumers have changed their habits in the year 2010 and predominantly the brand of one or more products, in order to change their conviction.
According to barometers they had also to 61% of purchases dealers of their stadtviertels colonization and the purchase of food that is grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of the environmentally aware consumption this year had a 64 in the maximalwertes of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves himself as king of the recycling, which is seeking to present its in the environment to reduce traces left by he cares about the welfare of animals.
But the social and environmental awareness, however, appears before his car to stop, so the scoreboard: just 28% of the quebecer indicated in the 2010 public transport used or the mitfahrzentrale prefers to have to, in order to demonstrate their ecological concern.
The walking and cycling were also of 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage supports the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of excentris
The quebecer government, which the Société Angus and the company parallèle, called on contribute financially to the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris, explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus and the company parallèle a donation of $7 million from the kultusministerium for the adoption of Daniel Langlois was kinokomplexes excentris on the Boulevard saint-laurent had hoped for, in order to get this back to his real cineastischen function, appears not to receive what they have called for.
The government has accepted, although in this case, too, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government rather a bond in less than the amount initially had hoped for a viable solution to advantageous conditions could launch, at least in the opinion from the State scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch was again since the overall downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan has already been made by the President of the 'Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles " (sodec), François macerola, Minister st-pierre, the acts of excentris chairs.
Several days ago he was her one last sachbericht.
The counter-proposal from the cabinet was sent but the sodec on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December, at this time to reply.
In any case, the premise of the staatsspende seems really to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the takeover of excentris had revolted by this argument, stories about the culture ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to do, which he does not also other cinemas.
Several other market segment of the cases, however, in contrast, a substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, according to the design of the cinema for self-financed over ten years under great difficulties, the autorenkino in the confines of his kinokomplexes presented, as regards the exception from the treasury could justify.
The lack of cinema, the independent films show in Montreal, is more than obvious, and excentris knew his clients in the book.
Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini taxes at the top, in turn, is a privately financed campagne, of the 700 000, a sum $expect, in order to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen, films in excentris continues to show, namely Le parallèle.
The aim of the future purchasers, it is, the three theatres on 27 February of next year with the showing of the very successful film by Xavier beauvois "des hommes et of dieux 'newly opened.
Christian yaccarini but did the newspaper, "Le Devoir published" not removed, and it ignores what he and his group from the revised downwards, the proposals we made you.
Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks, drop the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans; I think you are, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada open.
Consequently, the American diplomats have been surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot is not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government, budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday, the public were spread, still offer more pikante details than the mere substantial content, in which it has a very bad outcome.
One of 22 September 2008, link, in other words, in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing, it was reported, the point the United Nations no longer apply to their political bosses by discussed operations.
To the surprise of David Wilkins, of servicemen in Ottawa, American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation.
"The Canadians innewohnender owing almost an inferiority complex may have prompted the Canadian, political leaders, much more to do with internal issues of daily life to talk, as the United States in this election the ball (as in 1988 during the campaign about the free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, so, he concludes, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent but potentially to be implemented in order to speak of him."
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less so as the two countries have been intensive political and economic relations.
"logically," so he should be evaluated, "the ability of a candidate, a party and a lot more of a party leaders to engage in such an essential relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the spirit."
The other expression of this sense of importance in the open on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, chargé d 'affaires in Ottawa, gesendeten communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa to prepare.
"her trip will help in the preservation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February to ensure in the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars has emerged," breese, describes.
Nowhere was it mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent the House from the coalition would be overthrown and allowed to continue as the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms would have an impact.
Another, from January 2008, and on the part of the Wilkins " s ambassador to Washington from the increasingly negative communication involving an evolving picture that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series, of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which little of subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or contributions for the purposes of muskelprotze carried out by the CIA interrogation can observe.
A different communication reported extensively about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe is prepared to incorporate certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner 's question is yes, but on the basis of an individual' case to case "decision.
Àm end of the meeting, described as "the state, he has a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, was given a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has committed the acts look again."
Finally, we realise that the mood on the website WikiLeaks heated.
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper, bears a very close adviser had on CBC, declared that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed."
He was here to Mike Huckabee a report from the United States.
A global plan to renew the lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFCs), suggested the nearly a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth 's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position on the steps of the specific projects, which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun, the absence of compelling reduction to compensate for the developed countries.
After the plan would put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of the lighting on the earth " s CFCs are to be avoided, if the weißglühenden pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of global vehicle fleets.
In Copenhagen last year had the great abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, reduktionsplänen to volunteers, the commitment to the global fckw-emissionen of 53 GT on 49 GT should lower.
Of this assessment, we must, however, still deduct 5 Gt, from now until 2020 the klimaanstieg by 2 degrees Celsius, to stabilise in order to prevent this out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears something like 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% of the light to produce.
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new led-glühbirnen reduced energy needs of this once again in the double.
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new led-glühbirnen, such as those of the manufacturer Philips this week on the market - has this society has also participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which is a suggestion the savings of the auswechselungsplanes over 100 countries, is to be applied.
Besides the fact that iese completely novel incandescent light bulbs, only very little heat, they can also with a regelwiderstand work.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury, and that they therefore as hazardous waste, in the developing world is not always possible, but the producers are a bring centre available.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury around the weißglühenden pears wasted to generate electricity.
In the United States alone, these are 25,000 tonnes of mercury from coal-fired power plants a year.
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international programme would generate.
Indonesia would, for example, $1 billion a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, it means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose infinite spiritual Indonesia 2.5 billion would cost.
Ivory Coast wildly expected the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election in the Ivory Coast, directly after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to carry out their work and receive the preliminary results were without further delay," said a spokesperson for the uno-chefs.
"He is asking all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast, your responsibility to demonstrate each initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain auslandsregierungen had the deadline, the Electoral Commission, which was established at midnight on Wednesday, three days after the election on Sunday, without veröffentlichkung miss the results.
Around 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the cei in television confirmed that the Commission 's work "would continue in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from around the world, the cei last May but the name of the victors of the second round under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo, and Alassane Ouattara whose opponents.
The gbagbo-lager counts but with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which, through the ex-rebellenlager the forces Nouvelles (fn) during the abortive coup in September 2002.
Pascal affi n 'guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the by the fn practiced moves to intimidation of voters in the north of the country, supporters of the President had deterred, going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled, if the Gbagbo complaints lodged by the Constitutional Court will be taken into account.
The gbagbo-kontrahenten but are now of the view that the highest court in the country, because he was not neutral by Paul Yao n 'dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, of any connection to the ex-rebellen denies that the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and Gbagbo, asked to respect them, even if he does not have gone so far as to claim the victory.
His bündnisparter reaffirm, Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost, and a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after you have prevented the Electoral Commission to publish the findings seie illegally.

Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary for Syria
During more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "espionage" was recorded, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy in akzentuierte alert, and the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attentive eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
From WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée the Americans had said his strategy, which went as far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of wanderern).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid, a kakavand in France and imprisoned by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes wanted Iranian to gegeleistung said.
Finally, they include the way in which the French Presidency of the media to the purposes of trying to manipulate this idea to make the credible, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title of "Iran: French comments on the way to deal with hijackings."
François richier, elysée-berater strategy that is discussed in the company of Patrice paoli, director of the Quai d " orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone.
They told her the French method.
The advised the Americans, everything possible to ensure their own nationals, the rückzuführen forcibly detained in Iran.
"power of noise," they said, expressing "loud and clear, without letting" the words' grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence ,"" immediate release "in the media.
This is necessary in order for the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to his image.
"since this is all the more so, since you ask, the Iranians, what not to do so."
Because "silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche on unauffälligem paths, the Iranians are "master in ausweichmanövern."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners, a "normal, Iranian tactic" was: "hostage taking for the purposes of political blackmail."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss, from the prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes) 'call for the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euros) bail.
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that, "will."
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1,800 French citizens arrested in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days ago, has been released from prison, but will continue to be held in Iran.
The information was in circulation: the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran are asking for is discovered, after a judge in Paris, has been released from detention.
The American Embassy is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the for the nuclear programme has provided material, is the release of Majid khakavand bad news.
France has a fool in purchase?
The liberation of the Iranian against the Frenchwoman?
At a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September, François richier assured us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it.
"It has a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister, Michèle Alliot-Marie, gave" (now), but "the French Government, the judicial decision can not change," he says.
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand continues to be under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number, is on again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians, "is currently in the Iranian Embassy managed buildings in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss, in Iran, too, the Elysée its efforts, not by means of information and of the media organized "fluchtversuche" to make us believe, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Games a "significant" and "influential role."
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony, and note that, in the manipulation of bear fruit, because several articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram evokes "the medienblitz the French authorities."
What is based so much "dankesbezeugung" to Mr Assad, wonders the Paris Embassy.
"in spite of their declarations lobpreis give full of the French authorities to secretly, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians really have done."
The document deals then deal with the reasons the Elysée have pushed this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aims to Sarkozy 's policy of openness towards Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A 2008 launched policy at the time "of many kritikerstimmen in France and abroad as premature and undeserved was perceived."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria attempts to laud, what we can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region."
It is also, "discord between Syria and Iran to spread."
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August had François richier to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever."
"but we have nevertheless grateful to you."
"This should at least be confusion on the part of the Iranians rioters."
Clotilde Reiss, returns on 16 May of 2010 after France.
Nicolas Sarkozy is in the Elysée.
In a communiqué he is grateful to the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
No Internet gambling for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will be a law, known as the "Cinderella," pass it to the young people, which will ban, after midnight online-games to play, by giving them access, as regierungsverantwortliche suggested.
A draft bill of the online-spiele-betreiber is to call upon young people under the age of 16 after midnight the to deny access to these games, will be presented to this Parliament in December, ago, representatives from education and familienministerien.
"many of these children play games all night long, and then have problems with learning in school and in life, a normal day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary for their health and their right to sleep," said Jo rin, with this draft legislation betrauter ministerialbeauftragter the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online-games was then again from 6 a.m. to access.
The herstellergesellschaften had a year of time to prepare for the application of the law, so he specified.
The government also fasser, the manufacturer, the daily to ask for access to these Games time granted to those young people whose parents ask, added the administrators added.
He would be just to those people who want it, gratisprogramme available, which allow the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers on a regular basis by various events associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online-game-wettbewerben.
In November, South Korea, compared to 58 other nations four gold medals at the world cyber games.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the ausrichterland
In a state of great excitement because of suspicions of appoints the FIFA executive committee on Thursday, the ausrichterländer the 2018 and 2022 world cups, a highly political election, in which the rangeln for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria in the background are threatening to push.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of the FIFA is accepted in Europe, its traditional stronghold, are held (the four candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien).
The edition 2022 will then be something exotic; the international football association hopes after the premiere on the African continent in the years 2010 new territories (Qatar), Australia, to be able to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) will continue to follow.
The list of figures who deemed the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes so threatening to the last minute.
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates.
After the FIFA offer an evaluation report, the English, spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) act bessseren arguments than those of their competitors.
But these are considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees moment of choice is not so important.
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that, once the World Cup was allowed to proceed, namely in 1966.
The BBC asked the ground again on Monday, giving them a story was broadcast, the three senior members of the kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to alienate the FIFA and the British designers to embarrass the primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks had an intensive lobbying.
The government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor, Tony Blair, the schachzuges successful in 2005 for London the organisation of the Olympic Games of 2012 had achieved.
Would this intensive use in order to comply with the image of England before the kommitee upgrade again?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo spanien-portugal does not lack trump cards, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his fußballkultur.
But the economic and financial shades of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are the chances of Russia, which, despite its shortfalls, in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transportation) for the weighty has become marginalised, climb.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided the openly suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparations for the vote" on the part of the kommiteemitglieder.
"It bewirft it with dirt, they are trying to embarrass them," Putin lashed out.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical to be favourites.
First economic world power, seat of the fifa-hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, the separately have drawn up a very good project.
But this new candidatures seem premature for two countries, the competitions in 2002 had co-organised.
Another threat: the long-expected approval by FIFA, the World Cup in 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities in 2022 will lapse.
With Australia and Qatar, with the aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, the FIFA their expansion into new areas, but these two countries to a greater risk because certainty.
Australia could also be used, such as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of the television (because of the zeitverschiebung) have to endure, the sensitive nerve centre of FIFA.
Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had prevented really.
Mitterrand had faith that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012.
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums, which is why we cannot, not good to face.
So he has to pretend that the doubt henceforth.
In one, as well as the other senses.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe.
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious nature, by his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011."
On Tuesday evening that he was in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would let slip a little, so fieberhaftigkeit.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President, just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008, the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement that no announcement.
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election on the occasion of such meeting in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years at worst still with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "does not believe that I am not thinking about the stage after that."
His words from the day before yesterday not to make him more candidates than the previous day, but also no less.
Should you comments, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of the wettlaufes the candidacy with the hp on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy is to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, the many Members of the PS earlier than expected to take the challenge.
The bad polls, on the other side.
For the first time the voters of the rights of a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to survey the bva-l 'express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully in the context of the Prime Minister.
"if he would be a defeat as possible, he would not" candidate Jean-Pierre Raffarin, agrees with.
"He will always believe victories can be corrected," Alain Juppé, who is with the offenkundigkeit has accepted.
Euro: the ECB is forced to hold their acquisitions of maintaining
The final assembly of the Council of the ECB 's Federal Reserve Board last year should be an opportunity for opportunities, such as one from the crisis, or at least the orders of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to announce the end of the year, to its conclusion.
The crisis of European public debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt, it can certainly cannot afford that, even today, more than tense situation in the European bond markets to an end, not their deterioration.
The political cost of this would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference the position taken by the ECB, active role in favour of the resolution of the staatshaushaltsverschuldung welcomes.
It has not dared to say, whether you believe that is the central bank can do more, for example, by boosting its programme of acquisitions of government bonds.
"My memories of my considerations for my European trading partner, above (...) '.
Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB President, had the previous day in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very redegewandt shown about his plans, but rather, to point out that the programme of purchases of hold on the secondary market, "" would, however, and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "will see, as the result of decisions."
Only one certainty: the ECB will be its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligationskäufe the coffers as the ECB last week at roughly doubled 1,35 billion euros.
And according to some traders leaks yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese hold have made.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases to the tune of EUR 67 billion.
Among the retailers will refer to the anticipation of the kaufkurses never doubted (see page 29).
The economists expect a remarkable change of even more.
If the anleihengeschäfte of about three months ago from the arsenal of the ECB will have disappeared, the latter is still in full geldmittelreserven on freigiebige kind, and to do so over a period of a week of up to three months.
The economists are already taken today, that this measure will extend to a number of months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB programme on essential nature will be amended."
"otherwise, they run the risk of new tensions in the short term, pigeons," speculates, Commerzbank economist Michael schubert.
"one for the course of the first quarter of 2011, the proposed progressive exit seems to me more likely" for its part, anticipating Norbert bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their intervention in the market of the debt, "the ECB should such a kaufvolumen to aufrechthalten bonds, which the sluggish market boost," adds Norbert bräms added.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain their presence on the market.
"They must, at any cost to the steller the lack of investors in the market for such action, and the hasty enthusiasm on to the most vulnerable states returns paid to prevent bezeugte yesterday," an important obligationeninhaber.
Because if the interest rates to start rising, the States would be prevented from even more, to reduce their debt or even to stabilise.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is in Italy for cover
After a worrying start for Italy, the situation yesterday with the decline in the eckzinsen to 10 years to relax a little.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti, the situation as "unentzifferbar" qualify and him with an "unpredictable" weekend will have to hear what the person in question, however, was denied by immediately.
On Tuesday, at any rate, if the gap with the German rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the Treaties in order to meet the konkursrisikos had risen to 263 points, with a certain kopflosigkeit in Rome had caused.
Silvio Berlusconi has had on his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German rates by 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had a "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence," and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy in the eurozone, such as Greece or Ireland is not."
"The bad news is that Italy, as Portugal is," said Irwin stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain words, that may be, is the problem of the absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, which the State is in danger, its financing needs will no longer be able to cover.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future will be an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the expected in the Senate is examining budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculated that the budget deficit next year or 4.3% of GDP (contrary to what the governments promised 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar about a new haushaltskollektiv, after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used.
"If need be, the new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
On the hour receives Italy the support of international institutions.
"the very foundations of Italy 's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, repeat that we already have for a long time," assured arrigo sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"at the moment there is no problem, neither in the short-term, even on long-term view because of Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. D. R.) stabilisationsfortschritte less demanding than from other countries," observed Pier Carlo padoan, chef-volkswirt of the OECD.
There remains the question of the political unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi is facing a motion of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which we would have preferred to have the elections could be organized at the end of March.
There is therefore a less favourable period for taking a decision about a severe crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of shut after
Christine Lagarde, it was only yesterday, in the context of a press conference in Paris, stressed: "I believe that it was still there on Sunday afternoon and also on the evening shows: the Europeans together, are clearly ready and committed to their currency, and to defend their area."
Although completely relatively - the withdrawal yesterday recorded in the zinsfüßen the European staatsobligationen was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
From a normalisierungsbeginn may not yet be the speech.
The rating agency Standard & Poor 's had announced that it could schuldenvermerk Portugal, probably the most effective target of speculators, lower today.
"as in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, especially in the banking systems of it," according to the opinion of the economists of the exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, given that "the political time passes a lot slower than that of markets."
The European countries, who are both this gap, as well as the risk that, are well aware, are stepping up the discussions on the strengthening of the existing shut.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and their counterparts in the broader sense, with the G20 are progressing well.
And this is also, in relation to the sittings of the eurogroupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is today.

Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, send part of structural reforms, especially in the field of efficiently organised labour market.

Lisbon and Madrid a different path than that Greece and Ireland, have done.
Both the one, and the other is at any price to avoid having to seek international assistance before they set up their own budgetkorrektive and essential structural reforms, which you have decided to permanently confidence again.
The European investors, in turn, is to talk about the options available to the normalisation process to speed up the markets of bonds.
Axel Weber, who is on 24 November in transit in Paris, as the first had the idea that, if the 750 through Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion euros will not be enough, so the Union would not hesitate to once again in their own pockets.
Economists from Barclays Capital, the market of the European public debt is paramount in player, judge, an extension of the 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.

Grand Paris métro: first financial skizzen
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry, on the Ile is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built.
At the start of construction - the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros was proclaimed.
In the theoretical framework, it is the sum total of the SGP would then, on the markets of a part of the finanzsumme to her twin.
Today it has finally come to first projections.
The amending budget from 2010, looked at this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures laid down in the first part of this money.
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax to erschließund and higher taxation on the offices of the ile-de France.
The former, so as to remove Article 15 of the draft law, is "in favour of the public body Société du Grand Paris."
This is quantified: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year."
Zweitere is an overhaul of the existing taxation: "in order to modernise them, in order for it to increase legal product and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to myself."
How much would the whole?
A mystery.
This amount is not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is far away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the kapitaldotation will be added by the state to be found and the Société du Grand Paris to and after the project to be done," is the explanatory remarks.
In the SGP is this system does not offensive.
"for the moment, in which we have been recorded revenue (the two taxes, D. R.), one of the studies over three years, and only then cover from the 4 billion dip," it is claimed.
"This will be noted and in the budget and to leave."
The SGP estimates that in 2013 will be started, the 4 billion for the budget to make a note of 2014.
This measure, whose 4 promised billion it will still be able to seek, is in danger of a troublesome right, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and race spies
The Wikileaks case has a twofold significance.
On one hand, it is as obvious scandal, turns a scandal, only one scandal in the sinner hypocrisy, which is the beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future, dominated by regression.
But we walk of the series after.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each by a secret service produced acts (a nation), other exclusively from press cuttings.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi 's throw from nothing more than what you anyway for months on end in any other Journal got to read (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile of Gaddafi " s kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time for their sketche stuff.
The rule, according to the secret dossier only from already well-known news must exist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go into a library, which is dedicated to esotherischen publications, you will realise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau templer, the or the rosenkreuzler) exactly what happened in previous works have already been written.
This is not only, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know how, where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who are the okkultismus devote to nothing different than what you already know and confirms what you already have learned.
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown.
Also the secret files.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could also be what is, for example, editor at Libération), which is just as true to what he considers it.
The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat had sent, were the same as those of us who already Newsweek published the previous week.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations made this dossier?
On one side of this, to say what any educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or an aircraft can take in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small virtue in spionagezentren have turned.
Any viewer of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not from hypocrisy that one way of doing this is to ignore.
Still, the fact it publicly to repeat violates the task of hypocrisy and serves, the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: the idea that a business-as-usual hackers of the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, runs the significant blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats.
In addition, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble.
But we are dealing the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, Orwell " s times, they could all power like a big brother, the pool every gesture of his subjects controlled.
Orwell " s prophecy would have been quite right since then as can highlight any movement, where you can control thanks to the telephone, drain every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would result in the total victims of the eye of power.
But, bearing in mind what is happening today, even the secret krypten of power is no longer the control of hackers can escape, so the kontrollgang, to be directed to unilaterally and will zirkelförmig.
The power of controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as rächer of the citizen - can the secrets of the power in experience.
How can a power, but keeping the is no longer able to preserve their own secrets?
It is true, Georg simmel has already said that a real mystery, a mystery is empty (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel 's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, as it surrenders the public sphere; but in styles of WikiLeaks, reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power.
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel against injustice, but Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this violation of which would be such a huge power has been done?
It is obvious that the Member States in future no longer reserved for information online posts - would be the one on the street corner angeklebten aushang guilt.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technology is to be hoped not, confidential reports on telephone to keep secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether, and when a Head of State is in a plane and moved one of its Members has been in contact with.
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships?
I know very well that my forecast at the moment and romanhaft sounds like science fiction, but I am compelled me to present the government agents on secret way to score and uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else than mere memory in order to deal with, and, moreover, the few written information they received in the schuhabsatz verbergend.
The information would be in single copy in closed drawers of stored: basically the spionageversuch had less success of Watergate, when WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today is like a cancer progresses, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraf communications had revolutionized, reconstructed the Internet with a telegrafen (telephone) line.
The (analogue) cassettes had the filmforschern allows, a film band for band auszukundschaften by one from back to front spulen and all the secrets of the installation could lift, while the (digital) CDS nowadays is nothing other than allow from chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen.
With the high-speed trains, we within three hours from Rome to Milan, while it by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications at car and return to the horse.
A final observation.
In former times was trying to understand what the press for secrets between the embassies were forged.
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France his finanzversprechen amount
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time the compliance with the quickly resolved financial promises (including "almost start" or premature) funding to study the of the developing countries have been implemented.
And already, the rough French schönredereien exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries are obliged to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years was promised, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to their partners from the fact their commitment on the fast-start-finanzierungen: to convince detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht of their Member States, press conference that large nebenevents, broschürenverteilung.
The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees for their estimated value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau.
The EU announced that in 2010 we have released EUR 2.2 billion, which it is in the right way to respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look into the details, things are a little more complex.
This money should be set according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional deployment was tabled, without, to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means.
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, the procedure has been blocked.
Today everyone selects the benchmark, he considers it as the best.
The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those who attacked the 2009: the international funding, and there are retained in the context of the financing "fast-start" over three years to 150 million.
Other countries have similar guidelines, either in terms of year or about conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding of "all new projects" to the year 2010 were "new and additional."
In other words, there are no guidelines on the expenditure of the previous year or on a global level of public development aid.
In practical terms, the total amount of the French aid to the developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding."
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his rechenmodus.
Some, such as France, for example, are 1 lent €than equivalent with donated €1.
That is clearly difficult to justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often conditional on the emissionseindämmung projects, which is actually based on technology) can be justified, it is misleading to try to present the euro, as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... and only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland than commitment should be (in other words, the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has no place in a different sense than the following consideration: it 'respect' his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros), and takes 8.5% accorded) 36.1 million euros) - see the EU documents, to see for yourselves.
France is the only country in the EU that loans, to a great extent.
Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) to 100% of its commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 €to meet their commitments, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a similar commitment.
Beautiful hokuspokus!
All in all, operated on France in his fast-start-finanzierung with a double fraud: to a part of the action with a weiterentwicklkung over time, and partly with the reality of financial support.
France, to believe that it is 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promise and it saves has spent EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Treasury Department (because it appears that there was the Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out a double negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations, but if there is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries is not completely fooled...
The chapter on the early funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate.
But it might be too much of the drop in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is essential to his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn.
First and foremost France could be a change in his verbuchungsart for the 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for his commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward (another key issue discussed) and at the moment: you can escape the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart its loans.
France could change its position, as well as progressive in terms of the issues to be, as it is in other things.
The hope is based on the new Minister for the environment Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week will arrive in Cancun.
An unexpected announcement on the fast-start of France and his vision of the "verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loan would, by nature, the international trust, raise the need for further discussions.
Red - of children received pesticides
A child of 10 years ago, on the day of 81 different chemical substances, so one of these Wednesday by the Association of générations futures (former movement on the protection of human rights and of respect for generations) study.
The association, said that its results "given the small number of samples analyzed no statistically significant value, but the problem illustrationscharakter pose" between July and September, which usually within four, of a nearly 10-year child to the meals, food consumed plus a zwischenmahlzeit in supermarkets oise and bought in Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and obstteilen, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were just as naschereien of laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The tellerbilanz is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or likely to cause cancer and five former karziogen classified as safe, as well as 37 substances with endokrinin-störfaktor, according to studies of several institutions such as the international cancer research centre.
"even if in the virtually all the cases the legal limits for any chemical, individually must not be exceeded substance, so remove this collection but very well that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances and substances with endokrinin-störfaktor is suspended, is cause for concern," the association said.
Breakfast alone already contain the butter and the tea with milk, more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safe as a proven carcinogen, as well as more than twenty residues, which can affect the hormonal systems.
The imported from Brazil, zwischenmahlzeit for apple, as scheduled, the study shows traces of six chemicals, including one in France banned fungicide.
The same applies to the Green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study traces of a strictly banned in the EU insektizids said.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from Pandora, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses of the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At the dinner was the lachssteak with 34 identified, chemical residues on "richest," and even the to warm up the meal in the microwave plastikteller used was not unencumbered.
The schlußendliche risk this "schadstoffcocktails" for consumers "will probably undervalued," according to the study.
"The Alliance Europe ecologie-les Verts" (ee-lv), for its part, "given the urgency of the situation," proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides, "the increase in diseases of" to stop them.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with regard to the presence of residues 365 of various in fruit and vegetables identified pesticides to be consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
