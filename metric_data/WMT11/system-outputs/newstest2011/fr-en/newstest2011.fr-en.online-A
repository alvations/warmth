That is what he is going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
New elected from CSSD á Mayor of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier for understanding at the level of the municipal Council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal Council owned CSSD, á á know if they know the argôt who was born in the last years á Town Hall, when they were partners in the current coalition which operated á Prague.
Coded vocabulary that political cream of Prague has put on the road during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some each of the figures, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known terms.
At least do they say this.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a jeunôt in the Prague policy responded Lukas Kaucky, elected to the culture test of the vocabulary of the"Godfather.""
And for what concerns the political veteran, Karel Brezina elected reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression among those that you are proposing that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz released expressions in June of this year before the pre-éĺectoral of the ODS Congress, writing chose 6 examples, as a priority those connected with the City Hall of Prague.
"The Socialists should explain the meaning of"voldemort,""the largest hole golf á Prague," go to the patisserie á," "nerve of beef," "betrayal of the capital" and "entôler."
Three of the elected officials have agreed for the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, which must conduct education á Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then the phone has not won.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I am not at all of these things there and how representatives of citizen democracy fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently the way we are going to to understand us our programs," a t he reacted.
As has already heard, Lukas Kaucky elected would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on contractors and friends of the novel Bem vocally.
"voldemort" said nothing á'Kaucky and the sole expression he has guessed in the test is "the largest hole golf á Prague."
"It is of the Blanka tunnel" said Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know newspapers."
"I will have to pay me a language course," pleasant t it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina, but also Lukas Plachy, elected officials for the environment, know that the hole in golf is Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks the meaning of "to go to the bakery."
"It is, I think, to go to a company," Plachy is willing to guess that it Janousek companies headquarters.
On the same your Brezina said that he draws his knowledge instead of newspapers and not one any vocabulary that he would use.
According to the candidates to tests there is no glossary of argôt in social democracy.
"I have had the Council with colleagues and it appears that we have really not something of this kind."
"You said rather names some time abbreviations and symbols are used," said Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the social democratic party, that party members call Hulda.
"They called me Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this, says Karel Brezina about nicknames."
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
Elected Weinert is Papy for members of the party or much less friendly small old representative Miroslav pocket, which attracted attention to him before the elections by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy."
Nicknames are also the only ones that admit use within the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky don't much like hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for the Prague President.
"Doctor of law with batons" recalls it seems that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his doctor of law JUDr. the police academy in bratislava.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common features.
They are part of the old generation, may not work for example for reasons of health, are free and have no child.
One who becomes "witch" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely that fate."
"On judge not young women in good health because they are involved in labour and birth of children," said sister which deals in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of over 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social action."
He published a pamphlet which should help to limit hunting witches.
The case involves a "hic."
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso does not know read," warned the daily newspaper Die Standard about the downside of writing education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after was tortured by three women and a man then burned with the oil they were sprayed.
This is the server of the BBC who reported this information.
The criminals claim that it was of the evil eye.
According to their oil version used for ritual anointing is emflammée in contact with the woman.
The oil has singed, seems it, when the team wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a contractor in 42 years of Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," said he.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce hunting witches, the Gambia not later that last year saw the President himself participate.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of her aunt, has launched a broad hunting witches who, seems, have participated in his death and is would be worked by black magic to also kill the President."
"Shaman of Guinea near venus to the rescue, led to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, of men and women randomly selected dansdes villages in Gambia"said in a message the Organization "amnesty International."
At the farm the imprisoned persons had to drink a potion herbal hallucinogenic effects which were in addition to other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
On pressure International is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: the poèles heat, he signed a higher rent.
A stately old man walked through the door of the centre customer of company RPG "coal baron" Byty Zdenek Bakal, the largest owner's private apartments to rent in Czech Republic.
He was wearing under his arm a folder with three new contracts of lease for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these people.
Instead of paying 3500 son must adjust from next year for an apartment 2 + 1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And there was no hot water and heating works solid fuel," shows his finger on the new contract of his human son who has signing authority.
"But I still signed" explains it to half in anger and half resigned.
The association citoyenne apartments BytyOKD.cz that describes the nouelles conditions of rental as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants do not sign and wait until December 7, which will be published a notice to explain how to claim.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"A says this, the other says something else" furrowed brow.
The Ostrava region became the laboratory of deregulation.
After the new year, is expecting most of the Czech Republic apartment whose rent do not match the market price.
For this reason, Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory."
The RPG in the Havirovska street waiting room is one of the four of the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Right next door stands a guard of a security with an aircraft company to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lit on the touch screen.
Only pressure and a paper with a number out of the aircraft.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your number is already beginning to illuminate on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it is your turn.
After a short time, an old couple comes to inquire about rent, but the new rents do not appear to relate to people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to settle problems as everywhere - request for repairs, events relating to insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people more Tunis-TD@international.GC.ca apartments of the portfolio of RPG receive mail with new lease contracts in their mailbox since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offered increases in rent from 15 to 38 per cent.
the special window for new rent is open to the public since November 18.
"it works for nearly a week, it is therefore still to test" responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the wicket when the client presents itself as a journalist.
The déragulation and the former apartments of Bakal minors are a very sensitive local issue.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats made State of fairly sustained before the elections and it now meets the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They do even changed me one... put n of snowboarding in the wc, to relieve in the introduction mentioned human."
However, most importantly, employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of the rent if they sign now as RPG has promised in a special offer.
This is a drawback of half of the amount of the rent that will receive the other loctaires who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But really, one-stop "deregulation" of the Havirovaska Street is not overwhelmed by issues.
"360 Customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," indicates the employee's desk.
And yet RPG courier both on its web site that showcases individual interviews on the rents when it is necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent is an independent tribunal which will take the decision.
"' It is not threats but only to inform on how unique and legitimate to act lawfully," indicates RPG on its web site.
"Here person going to the tribunal to" think one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street before the customer centre gives him reason.
"I 13000 crowns of retirement and remains 5000 crowns to eat, I have enough to go to court," said he.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek media asks that person signs and therefore the people waiting," says she.
The regulation of the rental ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, current rents do still not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the Fund for housing," said Pavel Klimes, Director of the residential portfolio of company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the Housing Fund which makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rent invest in apartments 4 billion over four years to 2011 a 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling from upholstered armchairs of the street Havirosvka waiting room, however repeats some information shown in red.
"' The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and not less than 31200 apartments is more than 90 per cent of the apartments of RPG."
"And it will always be more than CZK 7.50 m² per month," indicates the screen.
The increase of 38 per cent is that 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases, it is an increase of the sum really very low 19.66 (2) CZK m²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of the increase in rent (see graph) is rendered to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new Windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
Fact nursery school also, part offices including architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the arch Design Corporation.
No one could expect also houses a mini nursery school with what it takes - colour walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can get there the children of employees of arch design.
The society of projects-architectonic arch Design. workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagined his mini School of business since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly from the age of children and it was important to him that women architects and project managers can quickly return to work.
At the same time as time decreased work contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company arch Design. his social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work with caring for children.
They are employees of Arch.Design themselves who dreamt up this nursery school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain a staffing of the European Union and the Ministry of labour and Social Affairs.
The mini school is funded by means of the European social fund through the operational programme human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
With the funding allocations (at height of 2.8 mil.de CZK). They could buy equipment and devices and after two years ensure a skilled and road development.
After the use of the staffing of funding (two years) the arch Design Corporation. a duty after 3 years to operate the mini school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it is the Economy rating company that has helped to make the staffing request.
The care for children is provided by qualified personnel, throughout the day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher concerned with children. children can go to school without age limitation but they have more than three years.the most.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there may be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there is more to replace.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking on the hierarchical position.
Although it is error to individual care and education, mini kindergarten program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children are not that play but quality teaching is also insured - from the beginning to the preparation for school are taught English.
The class is equipped with not only toys and imaginative games but also of a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in the society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time control their child and not having the stress of a delay to pick up children in a remote school instead of working parents.
Parents therefore use their time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that develops a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design U.S. ' is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The House still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look in the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stairs to a spine of dinosaur and balconies to gules of fish.
It is and is the House Casa Battlo in Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the House received on the part of the premises the House nickname bone.
Organic forms, wild colors, using unusual stones, fragments of tiles and apmv, facade Recalling scales and across these curves, that is all what is ypique to the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal façade of the House held its lines of dream, its colors and pleasant textures reminiscent of the nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the pace and order thought with precision.
On the night the front of the House becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colours is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of forms appears also in interiors with the same extent.
Wood copy wave window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of doors, the eye and lamellae.
The Battlo House that stands in the neighbourhood Eixample street market Passeig de Gracia to number. 43, was born of the construction of a House of the architect Emilio Sala Cortes 1877.
Reconstruction is made for the House completed in 1906 and two years.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the construction vieile and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of an unusual reconstruction and cheaper Gaudi.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit House was not thinking only Gaudi.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol was working with him.
It is precisely on its project that are born decorations for an apartment in representation of the owner of the building and use of apmv for the facade.
For the façade also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work plans of the House Casa Battlo began with cooperation between Gaudi and Jujol success.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House of Gaudi's Casa Mila and Park Guell, in which there are other works of Gaudi.
Local nicknamed the House to warm just after its finish because of its organic forms "the House."
Others, in the specific mechanism of opening Windows have called it "the House that baille."
It said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the building contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought to House a unique system in its time of central heating, with vents for ventilation and typical chimneys.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems bizarre.
In creating Gaudi has absolutely not respected the guidelines for the construction of then and does not let interfere with them.
Start of construction he received on the part of the city building permit, knowing, of course that the data on reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after finishing for the municipal Council was horrified and requested changes.
He fancied not, for example, members of the municipal Council as the pillars of the empiettent on the public sidewalk construction.
There was never modified, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's appeal Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the Gallery on the second floor there was a common and third lounge room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase which is accessed until an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of binding of spaces.
The common part may be related fully opening the gates of the salons and high society can comfortably communicate either confined space private for more intimate discussions.
The House with the reconstruction of Gaudi received addition of new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors and more.
The Gaudi set with light is also impressive, and the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is decorated with skylights.
The game two color gives a maximum of light in all floors of the House.
It was sufficient simply to bet on the principle that white information more the dark which instead absorbs the rays of the Sun.
The House Casa Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund of the Unesco may be visited by each.
At the first floor of the House is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners are willing to take that step in 2002 the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they found that it is a lucrative business, and they expanded the field visits to the common spaces and the attic including roof terraces.
The ticket in the monument is really cheap and costs EUR 16.50; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20% of discount.
The amount is still above the price of entry in other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the House with its fantastic turrets, you quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the House completely.
How to choose a mattress and a box spring: women have other criteria than men.
No conspicuous framework, but rather the quality of the reserved area at sunset, so the mattress and Foundation provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must harmoniously complement to appeal to a concrete user.
Several things are determinative for the choice: the weight, size, age, State of health and the gender of the owner.
The type of Interior which will place the mattress and Foundation is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
They have, in addition, heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough channels of ventilation in the heart and if they remain, and more, on a solid Board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
That which passes the light of time abroad where used frequently with a very thick mattress layer rammollissante, will hardly feel well on a low, hard surface.
"It is as well as all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there."
"For their shoulders tired, feet and ribs, they needed mattress with a rammollisante of lazy foam layer."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes articulations have a disorder of the nervous system which therefore incorrectly assume"the information"and the skin," says Sylva Adamczikova which specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why there are a few years the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex, but also Czech Tropico for example have appropriate mattresses."
You do not need to be an NHL guys to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and its shape according to the heat absorbed or well adapts to your body heat.
There is nothing pressure on you and you do not return in the night and after a difficult match.
You sleep simply better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress with your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180 cm therefore need to have a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or in any 180 cm.
For beds in a single place, the singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 140 cm.
It is convenient for visit.
' However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you're lying on the back you should ask the hands in a comfortable way with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Leatherwork - matelassiers and decorators dedicated several years to the problem of a sound sleep and the ergonomics of the furniture and teaches in specialized schools.
For a bed with two seats each has need of its own box spring and mattress, therefore attention however during the unites of choosing the mattress height.
Otherwise it will remain you to mount the bedspring at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattress at least 15 cm, this count for the layer of form and at least three centimetres aeration.
"To touch or in a sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," prevents Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requests a determined type of mattress.
Bed-mattress when the mattress and Foundation are United as the Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
The mattress is airing very evil; should not wash, which commonly is today ' hui.
And because during the night we perspire normally 0.2 to 0.75 l from sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a great (and stuffy) sieve.
This experts refuse to make advertising on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all his but.
And for that a Board of experience on the part of vendors: for mattress 120 / 140 cm, waiving to hygiene or wash for the coating of the mattress, but add rather a mattress of protection that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with zipper for the whole, it is said that after the opening on both sides (for washing and the size of the machine to wash it is very important!) otherwise handling large models (and for one person) becomes when it removes them a battle between a light weight and heavy weight on a ring.
A rigid Board instead of a box spring you have in your bed?
Never!
The maximum for a bed to visitors for a single night.
However to build the Board (if there is not) of vent holes and use the mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of aeration.
Polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For bed bases with slats to unique position with 14/18 slats, mattress in latex or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal, but it is always better for you to have a mattress slats more28 and above, where the lamellae are doubled in the part of the bottom of the kidneys and thus, it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For mattresses for several positions should not take mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the setting of the rigidity of the lamellae can also install the so-called cradle of shoulder.
It's a special bond of lamellae which allows to pressure or even tilt the lamella that shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "as wide as the back shoulders," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already envisaged by mattress manufacturers who for "male" began to use a zone rammollissante at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think women - they offer again a softer surface at the level of the hips.
For the most difficult client there is a mattress to wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure is disseminates in more points and diinue tension.
Of course, beware, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattress and box spring, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: Pillow must support the head and its peaks reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The recommended size is 50 X 60 cm that prefer the Norse by example.
When it is lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade (with the cradle of the bedspring shoulder or the rammollie in the mattress area) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first to base of straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials either mixtures.
The trend is also the bio mattress.
Raw materials based on pétrôle, from which it manufactures polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as for example of soybean oil.
Almost all well-known manufacturers use precisely the soybean.
"The Bio for mattresses qualifier means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are used also for coatings of mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add components which develop the forest or lavender perfumes.
There are differences between the man and woman.
While plants of birch extract that mattress coating absorbs heat and cool the body, "cools" human coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates the blood circulation and therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
Current favorite?
Mattresses manufactured from cold foam (it has more pores with a cellular structure therefore disturbed more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.)
The combination of different cold foams rigidities gives mattresses polyzones who know precisely where the head, down the back and the feet.
You will pay a 7000 crowns quality mattresses and more.
Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Save for the mattress and the box spring is not simple.
From time to time may be in any special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
As for example the Magniflex company offering Duofreeze mattresses with foam memory Memory sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
You can obviously take the second free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material to a "cosmic" pace.
It began as a material for NASA because the astronauts were at the start of the huge load factors.
The Tempur is rammollit heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
He therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes it an optimal pressure.
It is ideal against the evil dormi and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for the mattress, but also for products for health, as special cushions the foot relieve legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or the same type.
Devices to monitor people are increasingly requested by parents who wish to monitor their children.
Fear for their child brings more people to think about monitor them through a GPS.
The system, implemented at the beginning to search for cars can equally well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as in example one small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of small Anicka moved a large number of people and they began looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is disturbing their privacy.
"We strive to tell all that he is not espionage, but only another way to reduce the probability that there is another tragedy," says Petr Pilin MAcro Weil society, which is one of the suppliers of appliances for tracing on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, as for example put it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin."
He says children should always know for what purpose is used "the box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, attention that if the child does not want to wear on him a thing of this type, it is in Dispose.
"' And even the smaller can show great creativity when it comes to express something Dispose when they do not want to be under control."
"Mobile phones, which can cut as these plot devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
In her view, the fact that this type of aircraft can help assault is very questionable.
"If there is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything so that the child is not electronic device that can locate."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as will develop appliances for tracing, they (the criminals) will find them also because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals are always ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
Still, she admitted that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech RC Monitoring company, that offers tracing services both for the people, cars says to have this type of aircraft can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The device may be set up so that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
"Where the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
"' More expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who has slipped and is found lying motionless position," says Cech.
According to him the so-called smart phones which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a similar service after it be formatted with a special package.
The problem of the current tracing systems is that it is either a device similar to those that is in the size of a pendant box matches either the smaller telephone devices.
You can still lose them.
Pilina Macro Weil society, this is why tests are carried out now to make devices that are similar to common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any attacker will not recognize the trace apparatus."
"Either it is report after a certain time, which will be given to the police a little more time," he added.
That the tracing machinery be developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it utilisiera always the same technology for drawing cars.
It is a combination of systems for the acquisition of a position by GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a mobile phone to alert the current position of a vehicle.
The military has both of detonating cord might turn with Czech Republic. But it can take only two years.
The army has purchased 445 km of fuses used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of defence had purchased in 224 km.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of detonating is two to four years maximum.
The Army purchased of detonating cord in the STV Group anonymous company for 40 million kroner.
The General staff gave as the reason for the shopping of a huge quantity of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to calculations by reserve to hold by the fireworks of the army, that MF DNES has contacted, it is apparent that even generals, officers with a command, Secretaries either household staff should have each year an exercise to explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of defence and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the army are no exception.
Only for arguing the annual consumption of the army of 60 km from detonating cords.
This distance is 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army reserves could support there for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true for the base of each new professionals drive it enough to the more than 2 m of detonating cord, as experts say, this means that the army with his new purchase assured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained recently to the Minister Vondra that have almost no ammunition for their handguns and shooting sessions are limited due to the requirements of money.
About the lack of body cloth we did not talk about.
"And me I don't head if they buy us a large quantity of detonating cords."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"the army is a good client we strive as traders simply for us," said the commercial Director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of defence, argued the unites of hundreds of km of detonating cords by the fact that the army will be "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports however for only four years of life of detonating cord and the fireworks of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in repositories, this can even up to four years," said one who does not want his name to be published in the criticism of the army.
Life time passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it still incorporates and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are however not free and still cost money.
Another argument of the Department is a rebate due to the amount for 445 km of cordeux detonating.
"They have cost US 60 per cent less than the supply of the year 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek is the interpreter in the opinion of the purchasers of the Ministry of defence.
Just to compare: annual consumption of detonating cords of the fireworks of the police to neutralize ammunition from the second world war or those after the Soviet army, exceed not the 1500 metres.
And the police command always only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
It has been established for reasons of security of the fireworks and to obtain more flexible types of detonating cords more modern and more reliable way.
the Ministry of defence now has big problems for the neutralization of tens of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when two hundred thousand men strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move, Cape on the Rhine.
What waits in a few years this Czech Army MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords which it buys today "on the cheap."
Until today I take advantage of contacts that I have obtained from the competition.
Well, the sale under his hotel franchise helped Lukas Pytloun place winner of the contest of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the contest of the best individual Entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, contractor for 28 years.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that to Libérec was missing a site of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
Its economies on what he had won when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he purchased a small building with 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still student in third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region gave me desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began a rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
It reinvests the benefit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, its contractor action allowed him to open for Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year he him came another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel to Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the franchise of the Pytloun hotels themselves are expressed," the number 1 entrepreneur of the year past.
"And for the sale of the license for the bringing into operation of a hotel on a large scale victory at the entrepreneur of the year competition has served well, adds Pytloun with recognition."
The victory brought it more popularity and be known to Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, appreciated me often and I must say, that it was very pleasant," said.
It recommends that participation in this contest to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He said that he uses until today its contacts and knowledge that he could not obtain otherwise.
"With those I have met through the competition I started to maintain commercial relations regularly."
According to him, fame to success had also impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I observed them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work we all together."
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we've had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
The meaning of the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind.
The one who came seeking price Slovansky dum for first place in the firm of the year competition organised by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which he has transformed a workshop of Ceska Skalice tooling in a firm to the turnover of 100 million kroner.
"' I can say that the reward has encouraged not just me my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to combat competition," said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And thus when the State has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small shop as compensation after the forfeiture of the property by the Communists, he did not hesitate long refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a company with a few comrades in the entourage of his father in the manufacture of bathtubs in plastics.
Not very long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, he became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the public non-specialized after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only our clients have started to really get to know the brand Farmet but also foreign partners who have started to realize that they were working with a company who obtained the greatest success in his country of origin"said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year not e it is not passed to Farmet only what the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of society had been made from the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"We have not escaped obviously this situation."
"Turnover fell by 40 per cent, and we had limited our production and even dismiss," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society must know that from time to time must be taken unpopular measures.
But they have managed the situation correctly and have retained results clients even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However to Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with allocations for training and research centre, have strengthened the company presentation in fairs-exhibitions international and won major awards at national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything suggests us that the crisis is behind them.
Public figures back and with them the number of employees also.
"The new winner I wish pleasant sense of victory, but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes senseless regulations.
The absurdity of the year survey is part of the clan of affairs for the fourth time.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year of the survey on the absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the offices of the documents that the officials can get on-line.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the administrations of Social Affairs requested an extract paper of the register of trade so that the employee can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes with the investigation.
"The Czech social insurance administration will more extract from the register of trade controls of the insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Administration of social insurance (CSSZ).
Highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in Czech Republic and do delete those absurd is the meaning of the competition of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a party organized by Hospodarske noviny business clan and still has a greater popularity.
Last year 3000 voters manifested themselves, if at least 4000 this year who have made their voices.
And this is not surprising, it is in our country the more various legal obligations that do that curbing the company and, more and more.
"We are perhaps some paperwork for tax returns to the first places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneur activity becomes a goal proclaimed by all Governments in recent years.
Compared to the world the situation in the is not improving.
The World Bank Czech Republic is situated at the 74 th place with regard to the conditions for the undertaking, either 8 seats from last year.
The absurdity of the year contest has been implemented for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can make State each year absurdities administrative and bureaucratic April to end September, deadline before the close of the competition.
To make it ya site web www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the competition chose seven candidates for "the antipremio" and allow the public to vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity which received the largest number of votes is declared winner.
Until the latest survey of last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and décrêts who have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by contractors but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" contest, so among the nominees is for example the requirement that maintenance vehicles motorways and fast tracks pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets all two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the site of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins always at the beginning of November on the Wenceslas Square, Prague is part of a happening which regularly participate of the personalities of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises Czech Republic or well Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of commerce of Czech Republic, attended the culminating moment of the competition.
"' Economic prosperity cannot function when the State met with âtons legs of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to delete, every year, at least three dozens of paragraphs which today are that complicate the business," to said Martin Kocourekthe Minister of industry and trade.
The effort to delete absurd décrêts is not a blow of the sword in the water.
In 2007, which is not liked people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days prior to the bureau for individual enterprise to the location of the company, the intention of going to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was removed with the individual Enterprise Act ammendement.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, who was to declare a journey of service for a foreign employee for 30 days, in the Office of labour has been removed with the text of law on the so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the order for physiotherapists have a large mirror in their cabinet, refrigerator and two scales automatic.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of health last year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category recognizes socially responsible firms.
Are evaluated ecological, humanitarian, training or even sports projects.
The novelty of this year of the competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which exists already for 5 years, is the category called the firm responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, manager regional of the mobile phone operator, Vodafone firm, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subclass of the firm of the year 2010 competition, organized by the firm of Vodaphone, registered companies that have no success with a single goal in the long term for the company.
Each adventure is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from the other can consider their support activity and forecasting the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns disabled persons and their employees health or personal problems.
Among the fourteen finalists for any Czech Republic is step example society of Pro Prague and Netera supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees then number of tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the region of Pardubice is the Isolit - Bravo company which is the main contributor to the Endowment Fund sponsors disabled children 17 years.
The fact to care for employees with health problems, can still cite the old factory for the manufacture of paper of Podebrad which employs more than 70 per cent and, for this, obtained the title of the firm responsible for the Central Bohemian region and which is placed third in the competition area the firm of the year organised by Vodaphone.
Olomouc, is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing work schedules relaxed and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, no, proportionally, reduction in pay.
The jury he déverné the title also because she achête priority to Czech manufacturers, argues a ditoyenne activity in closest entourage and cares about the environment.
"We try to recycle as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, Executive Director of the company.
the company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also think of the health of its employees and their implemented for each laptop ergonomic chair and a keyboard, encourages their work in home and uses the services of catering to a local protected factory for its actions.
"We support also the human Foundation in shade that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy representative of society.
While last place is located, also for its activities, a society of washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, participating in insurance retirement of its employees in the form of bonus above the standards.
"In our society we are contributing to food, transport, the increase in qualifications and recreation," said Joseph Strapac of the construction company of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
Were registered automatically in the category company responsible, all regional finalists for the competition of the firm of the year of Vodaphone, had responded to the questionnaires in attachment of the document for registration and had returned it to the organizer before August 15.
Improperly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the Organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in the running had not responded to the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the responsible firm but were not disqualified the firm of the year of Vodaphone"main"competition."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Organizer Bison & Rose Agency.
The Fund for land in Plzen, police conducted arrests in a public competition
In the building of the Fund for land in Plzen, the anti-corruption police proceeded to arrest these days.
The detectives were handcuffed to the trader and local contractor estate Lubos. (G).
It was sought to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in a way that the proposed field is obtained by a determined candidate.
It had to pay to Lubos g. a half-million kroner.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police continued an individual for insider trading following a call for tenders and a public competition." was reported for the newspaper Pravo, leader of the public prosecutor of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
Police handed the contractor from 46 years in freedom after 24 hours.
To find out how it could affect a public competition, it can only speculate on the if little official information.
A question of Pravo, the spokesman for the Fund of land Lubomira Cerna has indicated that the police had actually conducted an arrest to Plzen in a separate and in the workplace, in the open competition.
"It was in no way an employee and a customer, she said.
The open competition according to Cerna of real name "Appeal to provide rights for the transfer of lands under the Act on the Earth" and is implemented when occur several recipient candidates of law.
"These people propose, on appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions are to be resolved before that is the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed fees a ranking of the purchasers is implemented and the Fund of land then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos g. had, it is clear, information concerning those who were registered at the appeal, and as he himself is, also, a person beneficiary because having purchased a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to field candidates do not participate in the competition.
And he cashed no doubt by the fact to withdraw.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos g. had widely contacts over the standards to the FdT (Land Fund).
It was included in the case of the former Chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for criminal edit fields for which it had already edited the establishment of a construction decision.
Precisely Lubos g. had obtained for example from the land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place where was to be built the artery of access to the industrial area of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged it with City Hall for a building in the historic centre of the city which is far greater.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it might put the construction at risk by a block of land.
Households will pay a supplement of 100 kroner monthly housing.
Households will from January pay a supplement not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sanitation, supplies heating and in some places rents will also increase.
Families should therefore from January pull their wallets up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increased by 4.6 per cent, gas by almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some locations you will need to pay up to one-tenth more the provision of water and in many places central heating supplies are also more expensive.
The increase of electricity should approach for households in apartment 100 Crowns anually more than currently.
However all providers have decreased the price of electricity as development sensitive to encourage the production of renewable energies, including photovoltaic cells.
Gas increased moderately but of course at the time where people have the most need to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
We can therefore also count a hundred kroner more.
Although the electricity and gas increase in any of the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest Commons who plan the price increase.
For example in Pardubice and Hradec Kraloce households will pay starting in January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, Libérec families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague prepares an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation for the case where the city increased the rents of infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a supplement of 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague will still be part of the lowest compared to the entire country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already high, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will increase for example substantially in 450 thousand apartments for rent from January that is to say at the end of regulation.
For example ICC Byty society has of Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 per cent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by society.
Regulated rents that pay people in close to 300 thousand apartments could increase the year next 10 per cent.
Czech children is saoûlent rum and the fernet. Beer is more fashion and is gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and outstanding also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
Are drinks which lead most often those who are saoûlent, who are not yet fifteen years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of the physicians who encounter cases of admissions of the children departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drowsy."
"' The trend is really strong liquor," indicates to Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head, child Department of the Hospital of Horovice in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to steal a bottle at papa in the cupboard, it's sometimes singlel but it is the fernet and vodka which prevail '."
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not the feel," explains the head of the Department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the hospital Motol, gives him reason.
"In General, it is the rum or the fernet."
"It is today in fashion including alcohol in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was of slivovice that they brought the House," added Jurinova.
According to the head of Department Pélikan, see drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen years in the hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to working at Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he acted as ten years precisely in paediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren in the broad area completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized and four times"
"She acommencé his career at the age of twelve when she took her with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol as blood with more a mixture with of ecstasy," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was in the Park of exhibitions of Holesovice at a party."
"What is interesting is that he appeared not strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours" said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of the parents or their tolerance out of the common face the fact that their offspring engage the drink which are the main cause of the development of alcohol to children.
According to experts, it does however not dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"As the alcoholic means chronic dependence to alcohol for several years with all the phenomena arising but found not in children."
"Those who use the alcohol to repeat, it is rather a significantly negative back-ground of socio-familial," explained the Chief of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, approximately 40 drunken children have been hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic of Pediatrics at Motol.
Are integrated into the network that the case with a serious intoxication requiring hospitalization.
Drunken children after emergency care back home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol, after school he exsite according to three Pélikan vague seasonal with which we can count: the day of the witches, saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by despite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course I lived on the day of the witches admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in désintoxciation under medical control is ironically in a better position than the one that returned home and suffers from the aftermath of the "hangover."
In the morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients which needs organization.
"They are to do this better off because they spend an excellent evening then a gentle awakening and their is nothing wrong."
"They are only surprised by where they are," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time this spoil the mood of patients at least with the notes to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospital intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of Crowns.
"From time to time, I applied it as a means of education by counting these children how their drunkenness has cost and they could spend the summer in seasonal work to repay a single evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, their management in regression health insurance companies, which should recover the expenses related to care on the part of parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159, five in all, against which the Ministry of defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C - 295 M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain seat Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer.
This is the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone other than the Czech Army.
However, they were foreign exercises and demonstration flights.
It is the L - 159 T 1 two-seater versions which were until now in service with the Czech Army and who were in a State of flight.
Three remaining devices are single versions of the L-159.
They leave for the time being in Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of the Ministry of defence press, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"' Single L-159 aircraft planned for Exchange have taken on aircraft stored long without that this causes loads or additional investments for the Ministry of defence."
"L-159 T1 two-seater was exchanged in the State," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater since the Ministry signed an agreement with a value of 200 million kroner for the transformation of four single L-159 unused in two two-seater in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing the aircraft in some countries of the Alliance equipment.
"In the contract it is clear that takes into account L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used in the training of pilots of member countries of NATO."
"It is therefore the case from that which takes into account to determine how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L - 159 aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns has been endorsed year last by the Government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of defence has not launched tender and EADS contacted directly.
the Directorate of Defence argued while Exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought Aero Vodochody 72 aircraft and in uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
Purchase of aircraft Casa will probably be legal implications.
the European Commission has yet filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of defence to the Court of European justice because the aircraft should be chosen in a tender across Europe and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three aircraft Casa, the latter should arrive on Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
Longer than the ring index is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have longer than the ring index are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger is used simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men 60 years before," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, Professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the University of Warwick.
Finger could help determine what men should submit to the test for prostate cancer, including combining with genetic risk or other factors such as the offence of health aggrâvants family, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with cancer of the prostate and at the same time almost three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the shorter than the ring index of right hand.
For them as for the 19 per cent of those who had the fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longest index that ring the risk however fell to 33 percent for men 60 years before the decrease in risk reached 87 per cent.
The ratio of length of the two cited fingers - formed during the prenatal period - including indicates different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, Czech geneticist renamed and former President of the Academy of sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that seems it not, seems it, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated."

The Americans have a new "smart gun"
The US Army has sent in Afghnistan a new weapon "intelligent," known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is as a specific super gun
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few metres.
Special ammunition of calibre 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive breaching, operates in fact as small grenades.
You can program the ammunition so that they will explode on contact with the target but also to any point of their ballistic trajectory.
Therefore, it can be used against an enemy behind a barrier, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected from above and when he falls over a deadly rain of steel shrapnel, this may put it out also.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon of infantry that uses "smart" technology.
"Private is used primarily in such manner that it is the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus gets a point for precise aiming, that he corrected his sight site and pulls the trigger."
"Say that you have referred to 543 metres."
When you press the trigger, weapon loads and draws at the distance of 543 metres more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, said Audette."

The Japanese group Fujitsu relocating its branch office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As was stated on Wednesday giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, located so far on the place of the city of Bad Homburg Marienbaderwill be transferred to Astro Park, huge office complex located on rue Lyoner Straße du Quartier Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term, the Group should consolidate 100 jobs still scattered so far in the region.
Offer to lease was extremely attractive. Furthermore, offices to open Astro Park area are better suited to the mode of work of the contributors.
Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a crucial location featuring a remarkable infrastructure."
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for global enterprise as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region has yesterday the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
Responsible for Economic Affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global actor" had thus conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession in relating faith instead of implementation."
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implementation is a boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our help in this endeavour," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations nothing could change to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer to the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It now to avoid that if exceptional place remains vacant for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, City Hall square building, used so far by the Fujitsu company and the "small vertical" nearby, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the construction project controversial of the Spa.
A project joint the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entry of the city was founded between the station and the Town Hall. It generated much criticism, not only the impressive development of the surfaces that were formerly part of parking, but for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company rating and advice in investment, Feri, the maker of computers for distribution systems of travel, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, have moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German group of specialized Frankfurt Immobilien Chancen bought buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings have been resold to the Madrid-based Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA.
The Fujitsu Group, which is headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the third largest provider of computer products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers of enterprises and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly much more than employees in Munich.
Branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaving Bad Homburg moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
This 7000 square meters took rental in the Astro Park building.
This old complex of twenty years, whose name recalls its plan in the shape of Star, among other houses the headquarters of the Confederation of the electronics and Electrotechnics industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is more difficult.
Provider Internet Amazon has expelled its servers site specializing in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude may be the political pressures after the publications of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes cache.
Wikileaks founder Assange Mr. apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with still greater force.
The Group of cyber-activists "wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted in America so far and is now seeking a hosting provider in Europe.
During this time, the prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stayed in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Excluded Wikileaks to server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom," indicated Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, cyber-business, Amazon, had removed documents from Wikileaks from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have resorted to the Web Service for Amazon (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent to care for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem at Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The television channel CNN, citing the Office of Mr Liebermann, reported that Amazon has prohibited Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation conducted by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The President of the commission of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British "guardian" newspaper reported.
"I would have liked that Amazon takes this action earlier in previous publications classified information Wikileaks" the Senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is unscrupulous and illegal, monstrous manner." "In so doing, it puts our national security at risk and endangered life everywhere across the world," according to an independent release of the senators.
"No conscious business responsibilities, that either American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London "The independent" newspaper, the 39-year Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is found.
Cyber-activist constantly characterized intrigue orchestrated by detractors the proceedings brought against him by the Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
This is why Assange particularly feared for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson responded clearly to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks is prosecuted and executed for treason.
To the Canada, the head of Government Adviser Mr. stephen Harper told television, clearly ironic way, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
During this time, a controversy sparked between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the American President, Mr. Barack Obama, was described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and disclosed all recentlyto engage in espionage activities.
"I know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a website."
The US Government is now completely at the test bench the protection of databases.
According to a release of the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre of the fight against terrorism, has been appointed manager to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for implementing "structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which any administration Exchange and protect information.
In addition, the U.S. Government announced that he wanted to deal with dissidents and activists safety if ever they were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have just implemented to come into contact with them" said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of ice
At the "University Gelato" Bologna is prepared confectioners of ice to the best seasons of the year.
The three days training course organized for future glacier has had a great success and attracted visitors from all around.
In fact, from which comes all the ice?
The Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, which is in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, factory cream according to all rules of Italian art of the ice-making.
The turbine at ice removes the cream of ice of the showcase chilled with a spatula, the has in the waffle and then began to sell it.
To find out, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wishes to learn more about ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the output of its machines ice creams everywhere meet ideals high Italians.
The three days training course organized for future glacier has had a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses on chocolate ice and extending over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in the private ice cream.
Crisis of the quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply realize their yearning on the smooth ice.
This time, they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, of the Brazil to Saudi Arabia via the Hungary.
Jacky, Professor of art education from California is buff of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product in the future in the country of industrial ice.
Anke in Berlin is business management consultant and after a few years, it wants to draw a few thing of singular of this demanding profession for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian dream to open a gelato shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and an another entrant of the Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian women came because his children love the Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari explained first to participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Is decisive not only the good flavour, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano remember the course of the icing on the cake of national superstructure and, in General, South: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing appears quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large Blender that heated to 85 degrees through an electronic program, and then cooled immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a valve installed on the machine: it leaves a white base pasteurized cream, basis of all kinds of ice milk.
The trainer is immediately assaulted question: is it possible to make ice by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact to be mislead by the spirit of the time.
One who speaks only "made from natural ingredients" ice, has perhaps despite this used stabilizers: often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is obviously possible to produce ice without the use of stabilizer, only need to sell it within a period of 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client author nothing else than to ice pellets.
Some changes of basis weight are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that it acquires in the RADIUS fruits or sweets from the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"suppliers will try all of pass you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
In the revenue of the fruit sorbets with fresh fruit and sugar.
In the ice cream made from the mass of white base which, by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and is, when is added to cocoa powder, the basis of all the possible desserts chocolate.
Now, all course participants must pass the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites from time to time to produce four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less of aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Different kinds of ice fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, most fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely best.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste of nuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi, a popular ice, is produced from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture is properly within the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise in calculation: If using the purée of fishing with a lot of sugar, must be reduced in the basic recipe of sugar.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for ice lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (wine is used to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice requires more, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of base mass to help.
There is also an apparatus in which it simultaneously beats the mix of available ice to make creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automation, minor outages are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo to face cloth from head to foot fruit purée and, thus, splashes his comrades of studies when control of the colossal mixer Bowl he escapes.
Luciano master is of the opinion that "such an incident may occur in each course: is only a matter of time."
In an ambiguous position controllers
According to some sources, the industry who experimented with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European food safety authority.
This charge is now made by Testbiotech expert group which is regarded as an independent Institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a theory of conspiracy, we us well informed," said Wednesday at Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information are what the Chairman of the Group of Efsa experts for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively in the development of the requirements of test of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to criticism by Mr. Then.
Developed requirements match verbatim, by paragraphs, positions of group pressure Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, at bottom, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounced a conflict of interest.
An officer of high rank of the Efsa has recently joined without condition or transitional period, the Swiss food group Syngenta. In so doing, it changed its camp.
There is little time, even the Radio of central Germany Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion as well of the German Federal Agency for the environment than MEPs.
However, Efsa does admit the existence of no conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it operates all reliable data, including those in the industry as long as they are of a professional quality.
It does not prohibit the experts working on behalf of the Efsa to build a contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the international Institute for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong, among others, in the field of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr. Then disagreed with the fact that genetically modified plants be accepted without no test feeding animals and that it has not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of corn genetically modified field cause" says Mr. Then.
Current practice is to test only the isolated proteins, not all the genetically modified plant which does not produce reliable results.
"If it does not search the risks, how can we then find them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
It is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and currently works at the Polytechnic of Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the sector of the industry tries more and influence or discredit the critical scientists.
That is why, there are barely even researchers who are not bound to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry control the security research."
The trace of stone
ULI Gsell as purchased, total approximately 400 kilo.
Monday afternoon, it was before the station of Stuttgart with its tube back.
There were demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: in September, excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the North Wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the Stuttgart central station in an underground station which will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration resulted in the judgment of the construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (now limestone) of Crailsheim, soft and coarse pavement evil built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell was a sculptor of 43 years residing in Ostfildern.
He in purchased some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He said enthusiastically: "a small and cheap, simple and terrestrial rock."
He stating that by the cutting saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know yet what he will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
ULI Gsell also.
traces of stones of Stuttgart lead to a former French Army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen has built up his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is the trade of old stones.
He purchased all the stones from the demolition occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge" he says in his Office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He tells that he was the subject of insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the North Wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated during whole days with opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained that he could not do anything at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it occurs, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the parallelepiped of stone weighing 80 kilos on average with a value between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some guard as memory in all hoping also able to make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tonnes, 25 full loading of a truck.
About half is still crowded in the forest, the rest being sold long.
Owners of gardens, landscape, individual gardeners.
They came across and took away everything which could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal turned long "mäuerle" or limitations of beds of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is no particular" said Mr. Rongen.
"had - been this political component."
He enters his car all-terrain, tour of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studies of law that it has abandoned. Later, he began to study biology later interest in the computer and finally become a carrier.
And a lover of stones.
It stores 40000 tonnes.
He raises to treasures everywhere in Germany.
He says that it is the largest dealer of old stones.
It will control.
Sand stones carved with art are posed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says enthusiastically.
"My favourite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sand stone, previously part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the rostrum of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and stories, from the Prefecture of police, Cannstatt travertine reddish granite from the Cathedral St. Blasien, Tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen think that once the stones were carved by hand and displaced simple hoists and carts drawn by oxen, he became quite friendly.
"It would be a scandal if such heritage was put in play."
He did not become rich, still less wealthy.
But the carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener are installed in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon, he had to go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Struggle to conquer the high potential talent
The counter has a great rush.
16 students are lining up to buy rolls of salmon, tomato sauce and the blancs-mangers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the car manufacturer Volkswagen design and mechanical engineering students invited to a workshop.
In a sort of competition of ideas, they should talk trade on the car of the future with VW designers, and, in passing, know the Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in competition for best brains and to engage, as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: recruit the most talented graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the labour market and they are being courted by others.
And because universities do not publish statements regarding the performance of their students, trying to identify the exceptional talents of retain them and practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop to the Brauschweig Technical University Automotive Group wooed talent.
A young lady of personnel department share pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs; young talent It shows the paths for access to the enclosure of the group.
This is Nico saddle at the Technical University of Braunschweig which is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "students come in contact with the industrial sector and gaining experience."
"The Volkswagen Group, he may know students, look the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new, is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was rather on professional project," says Mr. Seatpost.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much more bitter.
In property sectors, companies can no longer recruit their staff by performing a sort on a myriad of candidates.
But must boast their reliability and especially to woo the highly skilled workforce.
These are mainly from graduates of the courses of engineering located in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers posts remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, relative to the positions of engineer vacuum still grows.
Roman Dykta goes hunting for talent on behalf of KPMG, Office of audit, accounting and Council.
It organizes of costly events aimed at recruiting talents, such as for example running cruise KPMG-Race, a species of rallye-paper where competitors must find their way with GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they scour the United States this way.
Participants may incidentally visit the affiliates of KPMG and know the company.
One who is to participate decided to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will be for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are more important.
"We want to emerge from the lot with the cruise race."
For us, a simple cruise was"too little"
For the Hunter of talent is Mr. Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until today, we stayed in contact with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to complete their education and wish to soon send their applications to our company." He says.
Outside the direct amadouement in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are of quite classical manner by attending professional fairs where they are engaged in the hunting of the brains.
"We are trying to reach graduates attending trade shows."
"For example, at the salon of solar technologies," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, human resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
Bonn-based company employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe has knowledge of the issues related to succession.
Currently, 35 positions are available to the contest on the site of the company.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"This is expensive and time consuming," ensures?
Another means of establishing contact is to move by university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the possibility to perform professional internships or write his study in our project."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced in the solar specialists.
It is here that the company tries to its advertising in highlighting other qualities: custom atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," says Ms. Stübe, Chief of staff.
It long ago that money takes the lead role in the search for employment.
Flexible work hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute is an annual German employers honour roll.
To this effect, it queries collaborators on their level of satisfaction from their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The Chief of staff, Ms. Stübe hopes that this investment will improve the image of the company to job seekers.
"I think that the candidates rely mainly on external assessments with regard to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a strategy in the long term.
He advises its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to visit attractive is through its own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the brand image of the employer in its own workforce.
"satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When dealing with its employees well, and they identify with the company, they are just advertising of their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if it was playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama is the new oil drilling
There is no new drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, State of South-East of the United States Coast, in the coming years.
The Washington Government issued a ban on an equivalent prohibition and, thus, definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even in off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being prohibited.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, the drilling platform "deepwater Horizon" which is at the origin of this strict ban. It must remain in force at least for the next five years.
In this accident that to cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster United States, President Barack Obama, subjected to pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was prepared to allow the realization of new drilling in the eastern part of the Mexico Gulf.
Supporters of this solution and want to reduce the dependence of the United States foreign countries for oil supply is.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group faces claims for billions, is located in the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry established by Obama must present its findings December current.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the freezing of the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted claims to new drilling projects.
With more stringent control measures and stricter safety procedures, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent control authority, which is discredited after numerous charges of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms in depth.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced would remove the lucrative tax niches of the oil and gas groups.
Actors of this sector of activity are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of power in the Gulf would be significantly lower than that is the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the sector of the oil and gas" according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by BDO audit firm, before the drilling ban Wednesday.
Indeed, the American Enery Alliance deplores uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
Investments made in new support projects were deferred until further notice, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is dry
The water flowing in rivers is oiled Brown; It produces a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: as a result, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the Ogoniland in Nigeria.
Men live flight, corruption and the refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do you exhaust not," launches the environmentalist activist journalists to calm them: "you even today enough mud of oil before the lens of water."
The 37 year old Nigerian tried to photograph a young into the muddy water up to the chest, and fat drag around it: this scene seems almost beautiful in the brightness of the color of the Rainbow water.
Could not find that the basement is full of brown patches of crude oil.
On the shore of the River Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom tells that, once she was collecting shrimp by whole networks here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil must have sprung for a pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen living in the nearby town of Bodo must now rowing for six hours to reach the rich waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The extent of the devastation is obvious when it iterates through the marshes of mangrove traversed by water courses.
Instead of a clear water, the boat breaks cradingue brown water. Anyone who plunges his hand the removes any covered with oil.
Small mangrove roots emerge from the soil as licorice sticks. Isolated Palm leave sadly hang their palms.
Sought in vain the flocks of birds, as are found usually in wetlands: soon that the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence hits this paradise that looks like a gas station by the smell it.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari a sad air: "our life is characterized by a permanent danger with regard to health."
Comparison of wars is made.
The region where live the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged since tens of years: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because that they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to Ogoniland is prohibited to this company: while more than 2 million black gold barrel daily pumped with more than 5000 wellbore and 7000 km of oil pipelines in the whole of the Delta regionthree great times as the Switzerland, Ogoniland oil fields are undeveloped, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All the hundred metre stand in the water of the Trestles steel as bizarre sculptures: very affectionately refers to "Christmas trees" heads of drill holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are corroded by the corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a head of drilling of this nature breaks from time to time in piece because a constant flow of crude oil sank in the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: every year, the amount of oil equal to that which elapsed in the sea when the accident occurred in the "exxon valdez" supertanker off the coast of Alaska in 21 yearsone of the largest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility of persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actor.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and slurping of pipelines are more responsible for 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists for their part consider the explosion of drilling heads and pipelines perforated as the main causes.
In 2008, the American investigator Richard Steiner criticised the Shell Group to apply to Nigeria of essentially less stringent safety standards that everywhere around the world: only the failures of pipes is "still more rate that alleures."
Some forms emerge mangroves in a location which, seen from a distance, resembles a workshop abandoned, full of greasy and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with greasy to the neck.
A light flickers under one of the many barrels which sometimes connected to the pipe, sometimes scattered without cause on the site must be found: a small clandestine refinery.
It is heat crude oil, in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
As a first step, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe drops of kerosene fall and obtained finally diesel.
As Michael and his four colleagues daily produce 300 litres Diesel four drums: "This reported 34 000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest producer of oil in black Africa.
Nigeria has only a single refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than the ridiculously low of just 40 Euro cents per litre of Diesel: because they acquire their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protective" put across bore pipeline network across the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the Niger Delta.
Only a small quite insignificant part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: organized crime networks which are also among its members to politicians and high-ranking military, load the lion's share in of tankers and the dawned on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether to assign the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or the mode of lax production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as of intruders and the foundations of life of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there was no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, especially to Shell Ogoni relations so deteriorated that it was more a question of the withdrawal of the group. "maybe the operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will best prove."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not the subject of an arrest, but at best they provide them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly originating in the North of the country intend to enjoy as all Nigerians to the raw.
"At any point of view, this ruined stuff did get our far low country," said Akpori.
Investigators uncover structural defects in the reactors of the A380
The A380 suffers clearly from a major security problem.
In reviewing a device that made an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible default of construction which can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wishes to lodge a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, passengers on the Airbus belonging to the company Qantas had visibly had far more luck: the investigation that it conducted, Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 equipment a serious security problem, and it warned against a possible default of construction.
This potential failure would have serious consequences: it can cause coves of fatigue and the level of the connection of the conduct of oil leakage, indicates in taking a stand published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors."
Are concerned the Rolls-Royce manufactured reactors and equipping 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Airbus company Qantas, who had to make an emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore, among them.
The Australian airline now commenced legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a judicial complaint from an Australian Federal Court which is headquartered in Sydney. This approach gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The Director of Qantas, Mr Alan Joyce, said that his company would seek damages relatively to the incident in early November.
Pieces detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, is the ignition of oil which is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be performed on the superjumbos, which are also equipped with reactors in questions.
Safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said the spokesman of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The problem of security is regarded as sufficiently important to inform all the parties concerned.
After his plane emergency landing, the company air Qantas had locked ground its fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380.
As a precautionary measure, company Lufthansa replaced the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Any covered Germany of white: in one night, the snow fell almost across the country.
Chaos on the roads, trains and aircraft are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter is shivering the Germany: by freezing temperatures, the Republic is covered in snow during the night of Thursday, which led to chaos in many locations.
To the North and East, snow cover reaches 15 cm in places.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and many roads.
On national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to overcome the snow that kept to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office responsible for marine navigation and hydrography (DSH) is expected to this of tsunami have instead sue the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Piles of snow on highways and federal roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the Central of weather warning Meteomedia announced violet alert level was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it has fallen 30 cm of fresh snow that fresh and strong winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars there are remained stranded at night.
Even in the land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On highway A2, snow and wind have a disruption of traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances of traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, the trees fell on the tracks, catenary or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, it had to interrupt interregional transport Leipzig-Nürnberg.
Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The paramedics and firefighters had to supply 165 passengers of the train in blankets, food and beverages.
Snow winds swept roads.
Snowfall led to numerous flight cancellations at the major airports of Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said that 40 flights have been cancelled at Frankfurt am Main.
Winter service there ensures a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers stranded at the airport are more numerous, yet barely 400 beds there are made available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening at Ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because these layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when his car made barrel in a slippery to Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: the snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but she tourbillonnera in small bursts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be distressed by rapid and violent winds.
However, it is very cold, to less 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: according to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is seeking buyers for its two buildings of offices at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could yield up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has just beautify the headquarters of the Group: the twin towers located in the business district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
Now the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and he sought a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial times deutschland" writes, quoting a spokesman.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or to sell, and again in later rental."
It is as well as the largest financial institution of Germany already transferred its headquarters, shortly after.
It is only in the year 2007 that the Bank had acquired the twin towers for 272 million Euro to holders of equity. She had then rehabilitated them.
Some indications transformations aimed at optimizing energy engulfed around 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring lot of money to the Bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, industry experts believe the value of the towers, renamed "Green towers," approximately EUR 500 million in the meantime.
According to the spokesman, it is unclear now if the buildings will be sold again to a fund belonging to the Bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourning the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been thinking of the buried miners who have been declared dead following several explosions occurred in a mine.
It had not yet been back the body because the security situation of the affected wells continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age is between 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had found no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to go down the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had more no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be reassembled by.
Today, parents and friends organized a feast in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a bright sun Greymouth in the South of the island of New Zealand.
Two minutes of silence were observed.
29 Tables on which you could see the names, was installed in memory of the 29 miners buried, helmets and lamps.
The photos and personal belongings, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
Flags were at half-mast in all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the participants at the commemorative feast that the New Zealand has nourished the hope that the miners occurred in the surface.
"But they are never returned to the House."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits has stated that he cannot get over the death of his son as long as he has not seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative feast.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire in the New Zealand South Island coal mine.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when masses of explosive gases are moved, the burning temperature within the mine begin to decline.
Go to hell, Warrior!
The film Splatter is an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind with his film, "Walhalla Rising," the Warrior epic.
What public Danish Director Nicolas Winding Refn well could think turning "walhalla rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; It is free of his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminating his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers for a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When it is in a bad mood, he is pulling the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind said no word on his real name. Even the other characters escape, all at the most, the detour of one or two sentences a few terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, it said nothing and were feasting on the mountainous landscape incredibly beautiful in Scotland is the setting of the Viking world, approximately a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmaker with an interest in Existentialism and excellent shots.
When a film is several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn is considered, since the "pusher," relating to the drug trafficker trilogy fierce and full of style, as a sort of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refuses to bring a little more mainstream mood or introduce a little less brutal in the cinema of art and test.
Most supporters of art cinema must experience the horror to the brain which is spreading all around and the intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the borgne sailed for reasons that can be freely interpreted in a ship bound for Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries; they are drowned during an eternity by calm and haze until the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not then surprising that "walhalla rising" found no distributor of films by Germany and that there are only in the DVD format.
This is primarily because of the beautiful images of misery that earned some attention, but also because the image of a film exciting, from time to time, behind a bloody and pretentious appearance.
It is no dialogue in this film, nor coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into film.
The viewer can not escape.
Refn granted barely a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts the throat with frigid images and a mournful soundtrack, but primarily with an elusive hatred which gushes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young boy blond, which is faithfully held alongside the borgne, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the blind hero whose mobile are never known, but is hell at any time to combat enemies and provisionally of the allies into Warrior, is perhaps in Envoy of the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but perhaps also, nothing for those who are all way, rotted.
"walhalla rising" is an enigmatic film be hate or admire, which has for purpose the irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious work
The international agency of Atomic Energy (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear program developed by the Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, still less to submit to the Agency controls.
On the night of 5 to September 6, 2007, around midnight, at least four fighter aircraft F - 15 Israeli I attacked a mysterious building of cubic form on Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is located 30 kilometres: it is as-on Dair.
His name appears in the documents of the IAEA, as it is question of the reactor, the Syria built it seems with the help of the Korea of the North in pierre parallelepiped, concealed in a Valley marked by the absence of current electric.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of United States, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the reactor current, known under the name of the locality nearby el-Kibar, would be well capable of producing plutonium, which could produce atomic weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant that represents a copy in miniature of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was on the point to be placed in service, but it was not yet equipped with bars of fuels.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, it has barely more information than at the time, and even, over time the mystery thickens more.
The former President of the United States George w. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that, prior to the attack, the CIA was certainly sure that the Syria had built an el-Kibar reactor, but had little ' evidence showing that country developed "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some European intelligence officers prefer to be more careful about it and speak only of a "presumed reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
Lack of tangible evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
When questioned on how it ensures that it is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a terse response in summer by stating that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions."
The Syrians have certainly removed with precipitation the ruins of the "unused military building" and conducted a methodical flattening of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of experts from the IAEA led by the former Inspector Chief Oli Heinonen, discovered at el-Kibar of traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, IAEA received by a Member State of images from satellites of the commercial providers showing the time directly following the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired exclusive.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity of objectively.
The Syria has always ensured that it had never made a secret atomic program and had not built reactor.
Damascus argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has challenged this argument after the analysis of the particles as implausible.
Since that time, Damascus refuses any discussion about it, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, the Syria does not allow controllers to perform a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refusing access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will not do never comments on this subject."
It is thus that the investigation into this case drags in length since June 2008 without the resolution was reached a result and that it "turns more and more into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as recognized high ranking service Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in ViennaFinally it is a serious violation of the prohibition of nuclear weapons Treaty.
The IAEA considers that progress, to clarify the existence of three other facilities to be "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated what facilities it is here, or what is their function or what we suspect them to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "süddeutsche zeitung," they are known in the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of the towns nearby.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (international Institute of science and international security) of Washington has identified these localities and discovered a complex near Masyaf which would very likely be a suspicious objects on satellite images.
It is possible that he is in a military base or next to it directly; This is exactly the reason for which the Syria denies access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
Indeed, it is information provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttles between the three sites and the parallelepiped of stone to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used in the production of fuel."
It would have "no indications concerning sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes which are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with non-enriched uranium.
However, there is the severity of the plausible assumptions concerning the following fundamental questions: where should come the uranium and where would it later separated plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb.
It is not known if the rubble, which could hide the traces of great value, have been stored at the three sites.
When hundreds of loaded trucks of Earth will have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that the Syria has been examined in 1998 al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it can be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recent photos taken by satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA Inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, satellite photos show that the Syria has undertaken earthworks in the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA started to demand access to these locations.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but this has not contributed to avoid suspicion.
As he said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months to develop a plan to conduct inspections. This plan was to allow the Syria to preserve military secrets possible. Only invested time shows what great interest inspectors relate to this case.
During this time, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna did not state the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for that case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the Ambassador of the United States that evokes a few months ago which is known as special inspectionsone of the most powerful means including the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, already spoke of "an option that I have open in the future," but it hesitates again.
This means there is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA and many of the 35 countries that are represented have no desire to see the situation know an escalation.
on the other hand, as the diplomat who gives to reflect: "This would be, if at the end they find nothing"
Love in time of war
It's going badly since Angelina Jolie debuted in the summer as Director.
She wrote the scenario itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man.
We know nothing more about this story, but this is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumor States that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love of his Serbian executioner during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women federations immediately protested. In response, some sequences of shooting in Sarajevo have been displaced in last minute in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests are still in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic, of the Organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) United Nations and it required to meet the actress. Jolie is itself UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.
It is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago already, it proposed these women to meet with them in Hungary, but these have declined this offer.
"The meeting to be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
Was not there to love stories in concentration camps, and the scenario pretty long enough says its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reported that Hasecic organization, subsequently recommended that the High Commissioner of the United Nations withdraw the status of goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario pretty wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of culture, which received copies of its scenario, after some hesitation granted authorization of shooting in Sarajevo, but it is not known why not then came despite this permission.
The young author assures itself that she is not political objectives with his film, that it is doing so much effort that she is made aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give opportunity to all parties involved to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
That is why a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Net. It is quite different: lovers know each other well before the start of the war. It will meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in Serbian concentration camp where the man worked as a goalkeeper.
What is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim amourache of his executioner."
That beautiful film has started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, and speaks pretty, is "unfair and based on erroneous information."
Now, only the fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: placing illegally this scenario in the Net, like other previously.
Are we taking!
This evening, everything is new well among the Irish.
There is no trace of dismay.
This is why the local team dominates excessively visitors of Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout of joy on a strong musical background, they trample feet.
Baileyu-Pub in Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and succeed in breaking down tennis balls of table at a distance of three meters in the opposing team beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong." The winner gets € 500 more a plane ticket to go to attend in January in Las Vegas at the Championship of the world of beer-pong.
Cyan Tanner is a quiet individual; This subtle game drinking and the reserved computer specialist, these two behaviors go really well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years seeks to have fun, to walk away from the boring issue, leading to the future.
To play in Las Vegas is not in its projects. In January, he will conduct interviews of hiring in New Zealand.
"I am however experiencing a strange feeling" he says.
"The homeland is so far and I have no job."
Finally: His girlfriend waiting for him already in Auckland, "in less than two, she won her event project as desired job, perhaps a good sign" said the young man with a smile.
Because of gloomy prospects in the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resident of Sydney, his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people go: the situation of most of the families living on the island are similar to that of tanner.
The experts of the Institute of economic and social research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They provide even a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
Which represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are met, this will be a stream of emigration comparable to that suffered by the Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed a great ease, the sorrow now takes the place.
However, the economic crisis affects especially the Irish, trained young, who have known until now as moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and the social degradation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three people in ten less than thirty years are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes extensively letters of readers written by of young emigrants, who complain: "in Ireland, will drift."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers, but one which has the potential, is going and our country as a whole generation."
"The last to leave off the light."
The law Leanne Caulfield, President of the Union of the Irish students, student sees point a more bleak future because the Government does that throw powder in the eyes and offers no prospect for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the young student of 20 years.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to a practical stage without pay to another.
She states that are his biggest worries is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to deal positively with this theme.
McLarnon organizes the "workingabroadexpo" salon which offers full support on the theme "working abroad."
"But work abroad is new in the profession an amazing opportunity to take the first steps in the ranks of the occupational hierarchy," says the Manager.
Its website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and of snowboarders in canada.
The message is clear: work abroad is not a hardship, but it also guarantees the freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means be based elsewhere.
As there was more to do anything in Ireland to this engineer of 29 years, he works now with 15 Irish colleagues in the area of e building Germany.
A fashion house precisely out of Earth in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other projects Hanover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan visit only rarely his native country, because he participated in an additional workstation, so complete to repay credit contracted to build his house in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says in crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I virtually live."
He broke out of an embarrassed laughter through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with front well cared gardens, expensive cars of brands are stationed on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the House together with her sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, funded 100 percent by the credit.
"There were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid of see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflecting a moment, be hot tea, and said: "I have no children to maintain and I am young;" "all gone awry, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer don't like the wailing that it is often these days.
"No person shall suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic that that there lived once here on the island," he says.
"Work for a while abroad, this is not what may be worse, perhaps this is what made that we felt first Irish."
He laughs and then spoke of his father who went to England in the last big economic crisis.
"It was back there having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In its top, he has already a few years working in London. This is the reason why life should not be as easy for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand.
But there is still something which worries him well these days: day to organise its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that it could not become a farewell evening.
"Only, not many emotions," he said while drinking a long SIP of beer.
"A farewell, it is still worrying."
"Call it rather a farewell evening, very relaxed, bringing a few friends, with a few drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support to democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as in private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And the Brazil is seen as influential as the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of the survey of this year, in September and early October.
The first is quite sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the rim of the Pacific from South America (see table 1).
For example, in the Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, the support for democracy is passed a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased to Mexico, where the economy is straightened after suffering a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents to the Mexico and the Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowered the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region reported satisfaction with the manner in which the democracy of their country worked in practice; It is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001 (chart 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their Government, the same year last in both cases; but strong increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
This held good during the global financial crisis, if certainly due to the fact that many of America's countries have undergone only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a network of social security contributed to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission for Latin America United Nations reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty have increased only slightly in 2009 and again declined this year, 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of the Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a sentiment widely shared progress
What is more rare in Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crime escalated and the Mexico.
Is that for the second time since the survey began that more respondents throughout Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem in their countries (see table 5).
Approximately 31% say that themselves or their loved one have been victim of a criminal act in the year; Nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents to the Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing President, Hugo Chavez, expropriated by many private companies.
The Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in the Mexico and most of Central America, while the Venezuela has this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and the Nicaragua.
A vote defiled
No one expected to be perfect in Haiti November 28 General elections.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the countries affected and plunged in fear.
Ballot boxes were presented and a new ballot, voting bulletins scattered goutières, offices ransacked voting and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who had been displaced after the January earthquake, roamed in the neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen candidates in the presidential election, including several alleged favourites, have denounced the fraud and demanded the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond mullet, the top official in Haiti of the United Nations, consider the event as "an election quite good in many respects."
Us observers from the Organization of States and the community of Caribbean cautiously stated that they did "not believe that these irregularities also serious they are, had necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing President, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results December 7.
The second round expected is planned for January.
Hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady withdrew from their initial appeal that the vote be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second Tura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic which is raging, and more than 1 million survivors in the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but have been prevented to disruption.
Nearly 250,000 identification cards needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate Government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
Thus, it is clear, Haitians do so themselves.
The tip of the foot to the centre
The weeks after has become suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, President of the Argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy from the public who has improved his approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; It is the highest level since that she was elected in 2007.
Yet, turn it into a successful next year for a second term in an election campaign could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, obviously in mourning, that she would abandon or not the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former partner policyNéstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the same economic policy after his wife succeeded him as President, was used to develop budgets underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra money will.
The Government of Ms. Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was thrown into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied to Ms. Fernández.
But after sessions chaotic (where a parliamentarian was hit in the face one of his peers and where others have accused the Government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not fight me," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President still greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage claims of trade unions, see this close figure of 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when the Argentina feared economic collapse, has made a priority of the growth and the reduction of poverty, instead of the control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the Statistical Office, which conducted falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Now can Ms. Fernández moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases the year next to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices for agricultural exports from the Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the coup de pouce growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
It may be the reason for which Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore financial relations of the Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with bondholders who had refused an earlier restructuring forced the debt for which the Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this may involve monitoring by the IMF, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; what looks like a prelude of the remediation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When the Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will be dropped.
If she wants to win another election, it will have to decide to renounce or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
The Taiwanese are is oriented toward a kind of a closer union with the Mainland.
Does Taiwan thinks of its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters are presented on 27 November, or 70 per cent of those eligible to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, in what is considered as a General of the PresidentMa Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma is itself become a substitute for the feelings from the continent, having developed ties of innovative business, including a Pact of free partial Exchange, in the largest reorganization of the relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party has won three of the five mayoralties, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democrat-progressive (DPP) party, who would tilt toward the complete independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party vote share fell about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event has revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including trucks riotously campaign and flags of rally of mass with girls who danced dressed in minimal.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt has also been committed.
Sean link, son of link Chan, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, conducted an electoral tour for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd fired on the young Mr. link, purely through the face, the injuring and killing a passer-by.
Oddly, it was not determined if the gunman wanted to hurt Mr. link or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any event, said Tsai Ing - wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election leader MPB suspicion and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how much the question of the Mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates were added with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid displaying his links with the Government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stir up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese firms are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, claimed a confirmation for whether its China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
We expect that the Government in Beijing continues to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to lure Taiwan, return to the fold.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a Summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see a political integration; but let's start at the beginning.
Better to wait for this after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it went wrong: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, it was a provocative to explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a candidate for the DPP to the Presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, on condition that their discussions can be held without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party has a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma about China rushed approach.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have performed better if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, to not run for President.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between his potential candidates.
Must be the KMT to make an introspection of oneself.
Mr. Ma assessments were lower; Despite dramatic economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems largely due to unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his firm and its local branches will be reworked.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan support for the reconciliation is restricted.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already spent."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is selected in the category "best new artist" surprise
Conduct at the request of a President, and people are required to take judicial notice.
Esperanza Spalding, jazz bassist and singer of 26 years, hand-picked by President Obama to occur during his Nobel peace prize ceremony in 2009, scored one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale appointment in the "best new artist" category.
Whereas Spalding is a figure well known on the stage of the jazz since her 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains somewhat mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not fall out over three albums prior to registration; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "chamber music society," certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to at least draw a dotted line to Spalding by report success since Norah Jones in 2003equivalent closest to the Grammy Awards voters taking account of the productions of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters in the Grammy Awards have rightly honored "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album," a transferred on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of the primordial Favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, saxophonist James Moody veteran "Moody 4 B" and "Positootly" of keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favorite the hoarse voice of New Orleans and invited frequent "Treme" for HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz. who is tilts also strongly to some fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has gained some recognition well deserved in the large category together; in competition with rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the adventurer Lord Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" for his live byte's was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Appointment of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in traditional categories
Classical nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
At the top of the appointments, include "Deus Ex Machina" of Michael Daugherty, for piano and Orchestra, with five "Yes"; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "Yes."
Among the nominees having ties with the Southern California, there are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n ° 4, "Los Angeles," a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Walt Disney Concert Hall which opened in 2009.
Madolin Concerto by composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in the running for a reward.
Conventional appointments are distributed on 13 categories covering Orchestra, Opera, choral and solo records.
A category for classical producer of the year featured five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Appointments for the classic album are Symphonies n ° 3 and 4 of the royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Bruckner; "deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the famous" featuring various artists; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus Verdi "Requiem."
In the Opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love from Afar" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "the enchanted wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin's Orchestra and the chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" to Arthur Sullivan in the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.

In the category of conventional mixtures, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his recording "roots: my life, my song"
The mosque of Temecula project wins the approval of the planning commission.
A project of mosque Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission, after more than five hours of testimony in public often passionate.
Critics attacked the project claiming that he was promoting both terrorism as congestion of traffic.
But the Commissioners decided Wednesday evening that the new religious centre comply with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support: Christian, Jewish, Baha'i, you mention," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a U.S. citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They have just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until nearly midnight, most of the time, people deciding for or against the centre, at the time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is more of America," wrote an amicus.
"It is another planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, instead of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of the order of 135 families co-existe without incident in the Riverside County for years, but she wanted a space larger and better than the warehouse it leased a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque in 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean-style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would be a 4.32 hectare site on the road Nicolas about two miles east of the Chaparral High school.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal Council.
A microbe arsenic-tolerant raises the possibility of new types of lives on earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus, or arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even if it is a really"foreign"life form, commented Paul Davies C. w. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report contained in the online edition of the journal Science Thursday."
Six major elements have long been regarded as essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus by arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar d. from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference for discuss, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread Internet speculation that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, organizations may be able to use other elements to activate Biochemistry and that the"standard"set of elements, which we consider to be absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles CockellGlobal Professor at the Institute for scientific research, spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element to another fundamental Biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of Institute of astrology of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; Thus, it is speculated that a microbe exposed to these substances may be able to substitute one to another.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behaviour is really similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, agencies have difficulty in distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different that it does not exactly work as phosphorus;" "it penetrates inside and, to some extent, the work of our biochemical machine gum," explained Anbar.
The researchers have collected the bacterium known as the GFAJ-1 and it were exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that he can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, elsewhere on earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie s. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown it could walk.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, said; Thus, researchers have hypothesized that the earliest forms of life could use it.
"This suggests that there may be other ways of life, not only the way in which life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of energy and the national Institute of health.
The last two exhibition dogs stolen was found at Compton
The other two dogs of exposure on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Sheriffs of the County of Los Angeles have announced Thursday.
The four dogs of exhibition - two akitas and two pembroke corgis - Welsh disappeared Tuesday when someone has stolen the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, the authorities have announced.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late night Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Department of the Sheriff of the County of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs go well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good form."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what area and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We do not want say," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
Owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be attached to provide a comment Thursday.
They were brought together on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county located in Downey animal shelter.
The Sheriff's deputies recovered the truck and two dogs separately to Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a male of 3 years, and Didi, a female of 10 months - were unharmed, authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional contests this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were worn disappeared until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend for the national "AKC/Eukanuba" from Long Beach Championship, where they were planning to have Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions to other events planned in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/eukanuba," said Peek times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the tour of canine exhibition of almost a month of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard have checked in the motel.
They often remain in motels and parked their pick-up truck outside, next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer Puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a breton Spaniel - who stayed with them in the room of the motel.
But they have left the Akitas and corgis, thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have slightly opened Windows, ensure that the dogs have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek has said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM expects more than the final green light of the Court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM eventually obtained the green light to start from scratch.
A federal judge of the bankruptcy of New York, officially praised Thursday the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that approximately 5 billion of the debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the Thursday decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, more no legal obstacles do remain before MGM to recover flow under the tutelage of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber, Roger Birnbaumwhich will become the Director General of what will be a studio Lite.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 to 400 initially.
MGM did not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase will not find a $ 500 million credit facility, planned to finance the new operations and MGM productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the Investment Bank, which is itself facing $ 75 million, and should be funded into mid-December.
The process of restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank has been engaged to advise management on how to put its finances because it lacked the means to pay the interest amounting to $ 300 million per year.
In the month of August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron, and an expert in relief known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and satisfy creditors more than 140 of the studio took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009, to the company for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders which none of them was ready to pay the $ 2 billion which the creditors were to research.
In the spring of this year, needed just redo while MGM team had started work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements, and internal debates, finally was approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially out of bankruptcy in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive premiums of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $ 1.2 million, will receive a payment of $ 9.5 million.
Cooper companies, which have collected $375,000 per month for their services of the company, will receive a "success"bonus of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account restart the production of MGM, which is released only a single film this year, and set up a list of seven or eight films benefit from 2012 annual.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $ 265 000 000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds approximately 18% of the debt of MGM, has tried to achieve a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your budget balanced gifts
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy of this year is the IPAD, perhaps followed by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant gap in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bikes BMX $ 99 and only a game Kinect costs the same classical price as 10 skipping ropes of pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gifts of balance budget.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys-Wal Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - see electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Moore Law has evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more force; While cost the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there usually less than new toys associated with Web sites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys to button cells are increasing, and toys to rechargeable batteries.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are of the size of a Guinea pig India plush toys who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If buy you them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you can no longer stop.
To combine song to dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Drawing technology of Elmo Live of last year, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays games in turn as Simon Says and may be Lunar dance through its innovative articulated foot with lock-up.
Children who have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80's, you remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of cards quiz designed to transform a ride in a car in a session with an auto-correction and a workbook of valves.
If you are suspicious when your child is your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech's Mobigo ($60, 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, much that games educate not as effectively as the Leapster Explorer bundle ($70, 3 to 12 years) This is the first great revision the Leapster bundle range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($90, 3 to 7 years) uses a system of type iTunes to provide games and e-books and is equipped with an entry for SD card that can display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a box of matches, each with its own screen LED.
The objective is to form words by placing blocks online before that time flows, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of connection online.
Not based on their presence in the toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Pet Club Penguin online, for example, you can get a Disney 2 " (Mix_'N_Match_Figure_Pack,_5_$,_pour_les_6_à_12_ans) Club Penguin, which includes a marked piece of a hidden code."
When redeem you the code online, your child receives enough credits to the Club Penguin store for two items to the choice.
Can be roller skates or a toy Puffle pet.
Slightly larger than the hair after your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and over) is the latest micro-robots to button cell battery.
The false bug moves fast on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has withstood a fall from the table in the kitchen and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Make one side more mild to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait a place of the city as an urban sergeant training severely inspecting its nerve loads, emitting low voice of orders with a military authority.
He wanted that the female members of chengguan - responsible towering public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Hold you right!"
"Be knockout!"
Show them, he said, "what look like pretty girls!"
Four daughters having just spent adolescence in gloves white, dressed of jackets and trousers identical olive in colour, stiffened at attention.
Four pairs of shoes black talon, aligned to the rule.
Four treated hats perfectly perched at the top of hair by a blue and white striped node.
"Personally, I think they have a mean appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one Government tried to refresh the image of China urban inspectors.
A city has required that all new recruits have a diploma of superior studies.
Guangdong province exchanged uniforms against a more engaging so-called blue grey-green.
Wuhan, central China, has replaced the lower them - eyes by the strong manner: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded a uncontrollable snack truck by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the Peddler repackages its affairs and parte.
Xindu, 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu urban district, chose to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district completed its police of street urban of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, their shapely and their young age.
The idea is to give the police including a softer, more feminine.
Unfortunately, same Scarlett Johansson may have difficulties to attract the gaze on this underground urban brigade of China
And because, critics say.
Unlike the police, these agents are allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other penalties.
But Chinese media portrayed the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei have beaten to death a observer after he used his mobile phone to filming them process of disperse a protest against a waste landfill.
Last year, a manual training for inspectors Beijing, stolen and put online, describes how effectively overcome offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a peddler of watermelons was abandoned with brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A video game violence-impregnated, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained in the onslaught of street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the Government," deplored last year China Daily, a national publication, after a controversial genius on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "genuine full cleaning."
Skeptics say that the approach is well far.
After the district spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had real tasks or if they were but a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The announcement of the district the candidates women, aged between 18 to 22 years, required to have a beautiful silhouette and "five traits of the face in good order."
They must be larger than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at 26 years is mandatory.
Officers said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"This is their image which is important," said a certain district officer in Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental Web site.
"First, the external qualifications of the candidates determine if they fit;" "it is the size, weight, the traits of the face, etc"
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualifications."
Women of the Chengguan are like vases with flowers, he said, adding: "Be vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the Office of management of the district of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standard in numerous offers of employment Chinese for both sexes.
Such is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the facial features.
That means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
True, people with disabilities or disfigured must not apply.
"We cannot let a person who box or a hunchback come serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"It does not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang place near a monastery, is under the age of 22 and was finely curved pommelées with a mouth cheeks.
It does not consider the development of its appearance as being sexist, she said.
"Do you think that I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked a wry air.
Xu Yang, his old colleague to the pits for 21 years, said: "our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose that their mandate is limited, they said, because they eat more great ambitions of career to merely hunt vendors in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen vendors that move quickly on foot or by bike, by trying to sell the most possible rolls or bowls of tofu before escaping.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We have already told you several times!," said Ms. Xu while a seller fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-cart to noodles.
Officials describe their functions rather as monotonous as arduous.
"It is in roughly the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, age of 20 years, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of the vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect the sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in the capital of the province of Yunnan, Kunming, rebelled after the spread of false rumours that agents of the chengguan had killed a seller.
Overnight, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the chengguan were injured, 14 Government vehicles have been reversed or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid place Baoguang, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle which was be repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as their regulation.
The owner of the motorbike cried scandal.
An arm of the 15-minute railway followed until the police officers, in the sinister face, is be spawned a path to elbow blows to their vehicle and are left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator attached to the male team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
As the officers of the female sex, the coordinators - men aged 40 or more - purely a role of support.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a paintbox image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public which begins."
Prosecutors did not inculperont Senator Ensign
The Department of Justice prosecutors lifted criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to a wizard, a former campaign and its efforts to obtain a job of lobbying for the husband of the woman, were announced Wednesday counsel for Senator.
The decision puts an end to the more serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, Republican of Nevada which was considered a possible Republican 2012 presidential candidate until the scandal around his case made national headlines last year and adversely affect his career.
The Office of Mr. Ensign said that he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of an investigation of one year.
Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Counsel for Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was more the object of the inquiry and that he did not intend to maintain charge any against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to of many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, according to which there is significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to earn the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife Cynthia, the Senator with her case.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer in a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then, he has defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; According to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, it was prohibited for one year by law to be lobbying his former employer or of the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems inconsistent with the prohibition of the revolving door of lobbying.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer from Washington that specializes in the defence of clients of an inquiry by the Government.
Although the Department judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics have said that the Department seemed to be wary of political prosecution after a certain number of cashed setbacks of high level by the public integrity sectionincluding the decision taken last year to abandon the proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens accused fault of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a group which received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, senior counsel, Mr. Ensign said in an interview that he had received a call telephone on the part of a solicitor of the Department of Justice and a follow-up the next day, saying that the Department did not look for charges against his client Monday.
Counsel for Mr. Ensign team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the Senator, as his Office reaffirmed Wednesday in a news release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that he had made to the Prosecutor's Office.
"I am comfortable to enter the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we believe that they took the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to discontinue investigation into an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96.000 by the parents of Mr. Ensign to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said that it had insufficient evidence to prove that money was everything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company of Nevada which has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find work of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company has allowed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the head of Office of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him he "martelait" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue.
Mr. Ensign has also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Secretary of transportation to schedule a meeting for the airline after hired Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When news of the case have been surface last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as leader in the Republican ranks fourth in the Senate.
Having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks he had the intention of seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said Senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would soon follow the example of the Department of Justice and would end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is delighted to continue its hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The appeal of Cheshire will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent all the minutes of the reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a House which was burned down.
Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven j. Hayes, who has been recognized guilty of the murder of three members of the family Cheshire, Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the Board.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers already have file to the tribunal which matche appeal arguments, likely to be the courts for years.
What is provocative, that intense reporting on the trial - and the use generalized and extended by the journalists of the Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," so widespread and instant saturation with inflammatory details that the Board was badly influenced by the passions of the public.
Demand could push the appellate judges to debate on the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have indeed experience at this trial;" "I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in hearing rooms is infringement of human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas j. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The trial, Jon v. blue of the State superior court judge, tersely rejected claims in the judgment delivered last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have animated by passion.
But this does not appear to be the last word on the issue.
The courts of Appeal recognized for decades that the media coverage of the notorious case may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966 that date, the Supreme Court of the United States set aside the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was an "atmosphere of Carnival at the trial" by the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie "The fugitive."
Some lawyers reported that the courts of appeal seized to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes can be curious given the argument according to which new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication in courtroomsunimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trial, said John j. Donohue III, a professor at the school of law from Stanford who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it has been arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says that some judges of appeal might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is one of many other described by counsel for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; delaying the execution.
Also, for example, the defence counsel said that Mr. Hayes would have prejudiced when the judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of the prospective jurors showing them the gruesome photos of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some jurors said were horrified by pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-small, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, age 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and they will argue that the judge unjustly deported one of juror, who had been critical before prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual decision to lead the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors have been sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for Governor and the Senate of United States.
They have maintained that the computer media kept to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily shoving the tweets of the media, cameras and journalists before the courthouse," wrote the lawyers, "did resemble nothing of what had been seen previously here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion, that instant news were more incendiary than delivered more slowly, releases was a luddiste view that would impoverish the policy of the Court governing media coverage of the future trial.
But some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal were often attracted by the arguments according to which social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Counsel for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because media coverage of the trial and they indicated that they invoqueraient the need for new rules for new media.
"" This matter," wrote," represents one of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civility reconcile the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the fast return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress has produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be discussed during the "lame duck" session.
But clearly, at least there was a discussion polite on the differences of the two parties as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, not another episode where each side wanted to score points. partisan point scoring vacuum.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the commission on the deficit of the President was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending ideological divide; but that, however, still divides members.
That is barely sufficient to declare that a new era of cooperation had arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and mutual test for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
This is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from the participants have unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care, or the rights, the two parties remain in miles of distance.
Yet, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now on the side of the ethics and public policy Center.
"It is inevitable after the elections."
The elections are partisan passions and then they are estomptent.
"It is good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have choice to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or whole, of permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not because Republicans can not afford to give the impression that they are for reductions in taxes for the rich, while refusing to unemployed workers unemployment benefits.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism plane on a possible agreement on the issues raised in the relative "lame duck" session, with the ratification of the Covenant "new start."
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the problems most pressing of the session "lame duck" lead not to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
"Once that things that need to be made will be, psychology in the short term return to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner has also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what is happening at - between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing to the main event of 2012, he said."
The reasons are closely linked in the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and present voters to tea which contributed to its creation.
Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, however, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the commission of the deficit which include reforming the tax code and increase some taxes, raising the retirement age and reduce spending.
The co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, forced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a manner which cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they were hard to reach this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the Group; This suggests that there is on tax issues, less today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come the year next in the form of partisan clashes, as the Republicans challenged Obama budget, taxes and health care; then be followed by a period of bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties comply carefully the public reaction.
One which will be held in loss will change course and find compromises.
But it would nevertheless be an optimistic point of view.
Partisanship and polarization are larger today than they were in the 1990s and there seems to be a more ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress in there then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists of the two parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
American disclosed documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the town is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and put a part of the bribes to the Kremlin and protection money she collected, reported the Embassy of the United States in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are of huge rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only to legitimate businesses but also organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share while money moves to top of the scale.
The memorandum, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on its Web site Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since there was little trace of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who has a leading construction company, always denied accusations of corruption over the years; and he won several trial libel on these charges.
In September, he stated the following in a string of Russian television, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "it is crazy, it is to throw, is anything."
The Russians believe, an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; According to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of Embassy; and it is unthinkable to imagine that this would be diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
"The direct link between the Government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to the name of"dysfunctional"and said that the Government functioned more as a kleptocracy that Government," according to the note from the Embassy.
"Criminal elements have a"krysha" (term used in the criminal world / the mafia which means literally"roof"or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor," as well as through the bureaucracy of the Government of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts identify a structure three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the level low."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB breaststroke companies money and that police are targeted to small.
A source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners included that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and FSB (not groups of organized crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more ways and more authority but criminal groups that they are also protected by law."
"This is the reason for which the application for protection by criminal gangs is so high."
The note points out that, although extended the collection of money, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted little progress.
Note from the Embassy passes reviews reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, Director of the "think tank Indem" Moscow.
"But it is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a class policy because there is not in Russia."
Without politics, without objection, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, corruption costs rise, across the entire Russia more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (countries are classified at least in the more corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which was was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will stir with certainty of discontent within the Russian Government, although Luzhkov can be blamed to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is the problem.
Interviewed by CNN Larry King, Putin has been hypothesized that documents of WikiLeaks could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the remarks that diplomats from the United States had disclosed by calling Batman and approximate Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, important factor in domestic politics in this country, says.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspected that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly informed with decrepit concrete walls in bad quality, the Director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng raised man who had built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader;" "and he worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, the Commander remains popular in this bastion isolated former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he build hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the Government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled the victims to deal publicly with people who had participated in the scheme.
In June, the Government circulated a manual of high school who, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of his former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly conducted with the United Nations, delivered his first award for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centreKaing Khek via, better known as the "duch."
Before this evolution of the situation, anxiety increased to veterans of the Khmer Rouge from Anlong Veng. complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wishes to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, Director of the documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the scheme.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Government of Pol Pot - United in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to the border of Cambodia with the Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency which lasted until the last movements made in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of the West of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the first the country's democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the Government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by Government forces in 1999 in the mountains around Phanom.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Red Khmer veterans have sunk in poverty black, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many are those who remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few red Khmer elite officers have kept their posts of leader local in exchange for having laid down their arms, it is farmers non-qualified to the low rank and file.
"These people have benefited very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for justice and reconciliation which organizes public forums in all Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
ORS Lim, age of 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
"But now, life is difficult because we have our own needs."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal also caused trouble here.
Early next year, the tribunal should begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red khmer Minister.
The tribunal's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but he did not say if he continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears at Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64 years, former Chief of district in Banteay Meanchey province during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she said researchers to the Cambodia documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project that thousands of forced workers have died.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem was work in the field near his house in wood on stilts on a road outside Anlong Veng.
While the Sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the tribunal convened, she said, she would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the tribunal was pursuing several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"The Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, he said."
But facing the past is all that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said."
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, "A history of Democratic Kampuchea.," consisting of 75 pages
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the manuals of history of the Department of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know that a few details on the Khmer Rouge despite the connections of the town plan.
Touch Valeak, age of 19 years old, student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new manual was helping students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the tribunal," he said.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the tribunal continue."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, manual and the tribunal are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful put here.
In the heights of the mountains of Phanom, a path, overgrown with weeds and scattered with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of soot black, covered with a rusty tin roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a stack of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31 years, vendor of mobile phone of road, said that she knew not much about the man who was cremated at this location.
"But he has a great spirit;" and many people go there to pray, she said.
This was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and later that day, she plans to walk the last place of rest of Pol Pot, where it would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope to bring luck.
The Belarus agrees to waive its stock of WGU
The Government of the Belarus announced Wednesday that he would abandon his stock of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; This decision is part of a victory surprised President Obama campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a Summit on security.
The US Government had tried for years to convince the Belarus to waive highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with the Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium of military quality from a research centre of the Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the material about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Security Summit nuclear 47 nations, organized on the initiative of Obama; where the Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the Summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear 2012 nuclear security Summit Security Summit."
"This proves me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership for global security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant, important step" carried out by the Belarus.
Obama is committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
The Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George w. Bush.
At the Summit on nuclear safety of Obama, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never waive its uranium.
"We have kept the highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko then.
"It is our product..." "We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are going to sell it to anyone."
"We are going to use it for research purposes, that is all."
The Belarus is close to United States a few months ago; However, demonstrating the interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from the Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because equipment had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled over 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation was completed Monday and was conducted by aircraft, according to officials.
The US Government spent $ 13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the Belarus research facilities with uranium to low enriched; inappropriate for weapons.
"Careful coordination and organization have been implemented to strengthen the trust"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of energy in the global threat reduction.
According to estimates of the Centre for study of non-proliferation James Martin, the Belarus had this year at least 88 WGU books, and hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
The Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between the Belarus and the United States are strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and the Belarus have recognized that respect for democracy and Belarus human rights remained essential to improve bilateral relations;" "and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government issued no objection to the CIA flights
The Government has issued no objection to flights of the CIA with prisoners Taliban and Al-Qaeda Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is shown by documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the newspaper El Pais, which added that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed for ' power ' show that they were exercising proper vigilance on foreign aircraft that crossed Spain ."
In June 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, among which Spain, took place a meeting between the former North American Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega Ambassador.
The Vice President acknowledged that the report of the Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted on the fact that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega noted that Spain has no objection with regard to the flights of intelligence on top of the Spanish territory."
"They want only to be informed" to avoid that on "take them to the free," tells Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Department of external of this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter more profile low as possible, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
In turn, in January of 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the initiative of the judge to request declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain nothing incriminating, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after talking with the Attorney.
The United States showed still their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for information declassified CNI o of the Ministry of defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between the Governments," said Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the Ambassador of the United States and the Minister of internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, it he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider appropriate"He had given instructions to his staff "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, trying to declined temperature."
The Ambassador also expressed concern for the action of the PP in that case.
"In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests the fact that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights"," even if those revelations that have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.

The members of the popular party would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the CSP lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and recorded in the last autonomous elections members of Parliament, the catalan PP already covered the General because, even if there is progress or not, the Outlook is more positive, because the number of votes that this training gets in these century double normally than it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, popular catalans have obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 General, while at the autonomic 2006 they obtained in 316.222.
Sunday passed the SLC obtained 384.091 votes.
If it maintains this trend upward, desired a diversion of votes of the CSP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, this training analysts have calculated the fact that, if there would be general elections, the CPP could increased from 8 to 12 deputies in the CongressWhile UIC also gain four (there now 10) and CSP would lose in neither more nor less than 9 members (there 25).
These calculated would see that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a member - there three now - while ICV would retain a member or to gain a.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the municipal ensuring, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of Socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and their relay at the head of the Council General of Barcelonaone of the administrations that manipulates the budget more high-661 EUR million for 2011-.
Both the nationalists as the popular are in agreement with the fact that CCS could lose the mayors of Barcelona and Tarragona, Lérida, Gerona, where the Socialists would get the majority nor the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it is not fanciful that this formation lost its representation in the city of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have governed with the PP before the current Socialist Mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
Lleida, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes to CSP, including the Mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they found themselves several times.
The popular recorded progress also in some other important municipalities like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.

Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand has there three
Seven Pakistani and the Niger held by officers of the General Information of the Barcelona Police Commissioner formed a Jihad cell, led by the Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaida, between which "The Tigers for the liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let) the last being the author of the Mumbai attacks which have killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the internal gave great importance to these investigations, so ensure that with "operation Kampai" has "been debility" falsification of Al Qaeda apparatus at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity."

The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, it is here that in investigations participated, apart from Thai services, other European police units, it is in the territory of the European Union there may be days of shots similar to that recorded the night of Tuesday to Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (it held the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Muhammad Saddique Begum, Arshad Tanveer Khan and Niger Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand it has conducted another, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who operated from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and in other European countries.
The catalan network - which a part has been hit in 2009 - flying primarily Passport tourists who met the conditions marked by the named "Front Islamic world."
That is - to say the records should be name of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visa stamped.
Investigators emphasize that so far found no no detail that connects inmates in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the receptor groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nonetheless it must remember the fact that a few days before this attack to be committed, Catalonia is sent through an agency transfers a few miles of which was "invested" $ to buy maps mobile which were used after by the members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
Police seized of extensive documentation.
PP asked Mas suspend tax complicity
The leader of SLC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to expose personally to Artur Mas its conditions to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which boil down to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philo-sovereignists as was economic complicity that leader nationalist wishes to address at half of its mandate.
The President of the popular Catalan arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with security which gives the fact to have 18 deputies in elections Sunday passed, a number more than enough to love, since CiU candidate requires at least one of the qu as the objections abstain in the voting of the inauguration.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general election, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support a nomination "should eliminate all sovereignists and separatist speech," and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - that converge leader wants submit same to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to lose the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the Elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas to occupy the part of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
MAS had met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition-, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says that the dead were not due to "lack of"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed over 11 elderly people
The geriatric La Caritat of Olot (Girona) officials have offered yesterday a press conference to stress the wrongs done to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people which he was responsible in the meantime that worked.
The Director of the residence, Joan Sala, is presented accompanied by counsel for the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of the Caritat would that exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the civilian officials procedural situation."
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting on time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the greatest threat to the Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date August 2009 and that from this day that he had continued to kill.
The judge referred in the sentence it ordered the exhumation of eight body - former patients of the geriatric - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor explored personally the died but, due to age and disease patients, the formality took place by phone.
Caritat, through its Director, denied categorically yesterday this situation and noted that "the lack of measures may have been in no time the cause of what has past."
Counsel for the Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person that is the accused."
The person already named as "the Angel of death" day before yesterday admitted 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009, and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case it killing it him injecting a sobre-insulin dose, to difference of the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative tablets.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control centre personnel access to medicines.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in its desire to alleviate the suffering of the internal, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify if Vila is not lying by saying that he has sought for its first victims less cruel death or otherwise he has burnt inside by giving laundry as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the range 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of killings admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number was larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way kill after successfully committing eight murders.
This is why they say that they will remain at disposal of the Court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have abruptly yesterday reacted to the threat of Trichet yesterday warned that "markets must not underestimate our reaction capability."
Differentials of the devices were closed to the force and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of BCE to err and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a conscious signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it collapses, it is gets, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor soon to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB us today cited for removing liquidity measures and will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank required the finalization of the plan of purchase of debt due to its ineffectiveness and the Elimination of all the extraordinary measures of liquidity to term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that extends current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction sale to unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the bond purchase program and to give the signal to intensify it.
Tip If they do not perform the expectations generated, they over the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw measures of liquidity, God help us!
As well as during their meeting in the month of may in which they said that they had not even considered purchasing obligations and they have collapsé markets, history may repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In may he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought many, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the drafts to a year in Portugal auction has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% from 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, Portugal types have decreased 30 basis points in the curve and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the lyrics of Trichet.
In Ireland it published figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated figures represent 10,000 million in short term and 15,000 potential and they have a delay until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not detected the problem in July with stress testing, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government needs to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it is not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate the tone of his speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise which demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to submit the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday yesterday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sounding Gill investors such as Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange suffered 4.5%, double the rest European awards.
Difference in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we enjoy the surprise effect.
Today there is an auction-key of a three-year duty which will be out by the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it resolves with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain ask a Plan of Assistance would be a self-immolation.
They give us a line of liquidity we need, Treasury has more than 40.000 million in available liquidity, the triple from March, to very expensive types and they cut the access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy should continue to be that of the wife of Caesar, "in part of the being, appear."
Courage, we can get out us!

Red Bull F1 triumph with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull are entered into the world of formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exclusive world of speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In a first moment, person did take into account the options of a new stable which had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the Championship they have all bet on the triumph of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a pilot in the world of formula 1 champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the engine Renault that propels his car, talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform a team winner.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software for the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of high automobilistique competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool was used to create chains of assembly plants manufacturers throughout the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is replicating, accurately simulate the product or process prior to the construction of a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or most famous Nissan utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its plant in formula 1 led Red Bull to create and run "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changeschanges and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team working today 180 young professionals of high qualification which, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and propose any kind of changes to the cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is exclusively responsible for Renault.
Change materials, fuel, aerodynamics, and security features.
Changes can pass the virtual reality of the Simulator to reality in less than 24 hours through autoclaves of high technology and advanced production laser systems.
As single limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $ 40 million that each formula 1 team can spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull implemented high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything what is happening there is considered "top secret."
Personnel for this duty has 580 persons, enclosed two pilot champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the formula 1 of Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the vast technological resources that brand of energy drink has met in the service of its participation in circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notoriety zero.
The Director of technology of the plant, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that the progress of R + D in the case of race cars brought the 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while drivers provide 15% of the value added.
Nevey admits the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable Gladiators."

Sabadell is betting on 'steal' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, think that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war of the liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of the margins of the interests, that it will try to partially offset with increments of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expect capture one million individual clients, his task in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the future three years and to thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will be moving in 2011 a new master plan that will hold a will lability of three years.
The objective, apart from survive without need to grant public FROB, is earn a rating of market by the uptake of a new individual customers - if 700,000 million is deducted those who can get out of the Bank-, its great task to perform, because until now the Bank had spoiled more SMEs and corporations that the particular customer.
This year he has captured specific client 250,000 and 50,000 companies.
Market the individuals rating is 3.5%, while corporate it exceeds 10%.
Another base of the 2011-2013 plan is betting on productivity, or which is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs such as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the Bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, since the financial crisis has disrupted all plans for the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, finalize this year plan Director Optima, establishes it ya was four years ago, even though originally the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further year.
Customers who leave escape caisses of savings will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by FIPA, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be a year "difficult and transcendental."
Executive, in fact, think that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental to the survival of the Bank case, has insisted it.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities - which penalises the margins - reduces, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity move already at the cost of credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not tight tap, but differentials are highest," acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto has given orders to its network to limit credit to long term and increase the price of the differentials - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell plan based on organic even if growth as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
This is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "you seek more large dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," provided.
He says that the necessities of capital "greatly increase" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market uptake of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After that Sabadell can survive the temporal closing of markets, it has decreased the importance of the fact that some Bank predict already as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that it cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, can obtain funding in the short term through rest, thereby mitigating the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among unions
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which runs the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that were assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve to the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Confederation Española de Caisses of savings (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that the greater part of the merger has been completed, it cannot be said that Cajasol incorporation in the Group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most was conducted completely;" "it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already made under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who worked in this operation also," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of Association leaders and executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration occurs "in the most high speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way she materializes in the deadlines it set in the past"," not now, in the business with the Bank of Spain plans," a emphatisé it.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28.500 million in volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history by reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to be compliant with Basel," a noted it.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of opinions quite happy on the slowness of the process" showing "a lack of fluid and meaning," because "what is the Bank of Spain remember that must comply with the time limit before the end of the year."
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ensured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of the whole Europe and "probably" the world and awarded to people that the challenge a "lack of knowledge."
The leader has indicated that given the current economic conditions, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and funds to savings, a system which has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "going to the greatest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector is in is well from stress tests that BCE was realized in July.
Zapatero and the German Red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it establishes the conditions for the Union.
Market tensions have caused a doble Government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private placement or removal of the 426 euros in aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENAthe management of the airport of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lottery.
Another, the Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, unites to critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to its responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here the Germany has a vision fundamentally new that should be its future, which shocks with maintain ancient traditions of most of its partners.
Facing European resistance, Germany are starting to speculate on the three possible outputs of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would abandon the currency area.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now seems of science fiction, with a very favourable opinion current, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for a more macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines for countries that transgress, possible suspensions of payments one and extension to the private sector to the potential adjustment costs.
The German position is clear and so long that it defines, so now there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a reform Constitution to prevent from 2016.
This was the first signal of discrepancy between what Germany thought that it should be (plans of fiscal stringency and stability of public finances) and that its European partners, ci - includes the France, practiced.
The second stroke of the Central European country was when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save the Greece.
Since that time it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were against the rescue of the Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expresses again a clear position, asking the reform of the treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time require the private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-Europe because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although a bit watered-down, was approved and the months following, we should assist in the process of reform of the Union which make possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she would not cross.
And it says all that, even if now it must take measures with which it is may not be too much agreement, as from this date that the former operation of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in cessation of payments and, in this case here, the private sector also bear a party of the costs.
Germany said us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who presided Spanish growth, in the boom years will simply not be tolerated.
It is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked is much harder.
And what should absolutely not do so in these circumstances is us deceive ourselves.
I hope that today's turbulence leave arrive to us a greater tranquillity.
And that is known to seize the opportunity it has given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and its dual statement (reforms promises after the meeting of the past Saturday with big business and the announcement of the new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkelthe path was opened in the thesis must be of the order at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that considering the, cannot exclude to abandon a little serious country too stuffed monetary zone.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that it in warned us.
Sport and fraud of the Act
Tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the desire to escape a sanction.
Deportation clad in principle by both players, Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League has been pouring of ink on the anti-sportif character of such behavior and if the two players should be punished by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before to finish the game (which their team already clearly earned), the two players deliberately lost time when they committed errors to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players will perform regulatory penalty during the match next in the game of dam against Auxerre and may pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the discipline of UEFA Committee has sanctioned with two games the team coach, José Mourinho and of different economic sums involved players.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread it is part of the ethos, rules made, but followed the sport.
Part of the debate in the reported case is the fact that this was a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem shows nobility and honour and that on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) as protagonist and orchestrated dramatizingapparently by Mourinho, which adds an episode in addition to his dilated technician histrionic and provocative history.
In any case, the request debate if this type of conduct not prohibited expressly by contradicts regulation principles of sport, that is, if with these actions it commits a fraud Act; because, indeed, they are environmentally friendly actions with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the spirit of sport.
A property that includes the spirit of sport is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endanger, i.e. There was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which it refers with the correct game is avoid that team players offenders benefit unfairly from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of action of the Real Madrid players is that it fits to what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud Act, because its violation of the rules was not conducted in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has specifically attempted to be the most obvious possible to receive the penalisation of the arbitrator.
They expected and they willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get a reviewed well-intentioned mistakes.
Here it seems necessary to see that put not at a disadvantage to the rival and obtained a benefit in the same game also, because obviously the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And is not useful for the next match rather than strategy, because the club could not rely on these players.
Obviously the advantage is the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cartons that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is an advantage in the long term, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and otherwise, with this action the players perform a match penalty and pass to the second cycle of cartonsin which the suspension due to the accumulation of the paperboard product with a less than at the undergraduate.
So, climb to the top, is not so clear that either an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which made when same portion making strategic decisions that promote the benefit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players were not activated to avoid the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of the Act), m otherwise they chose instead the time in which they are subjected to it.
They took a strategic decision without defeating the penalty or flee it.
Even if the border between engineering and the fraud of the Act is diffuse, in this occasion I think there was a clear case of engineering.
Controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way to convey the Director to cause them.
The wrong caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of the offered for capturing groups in NCB Christmas dinners
The dictatorship of the calendar focuses this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations self-financed by the employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also returned the dinner groups before Christmas which continue to be the ball of oxygen for the restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but the crisis have lead in an offensive te price adjusted in order to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or meal, coincide interviewed business and sector associations.
To complete difficult accounting, calendar of this year (as the night of the Saint Sylvestre grave Friday) concentrated requests during the week of December 13, with the result so far one avalanche peak (17 and 17) reservations of dinners for days and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of hard times, there are many companies which eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Any is the situation, they ask all price battle, confirms Gaietà Farràs, President of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona.
The representative of the employer, now, don't dare to predict how will be the holidays this month.
"People reflects much before booking."
"They want to get out but they pay much attention to the prices," he says.
The case will be okay "for those who provide quality at a good price and good service," he adds, and recalled that customers tend to go down a level with the crisis, so that the slice around 25 euros became majority in the request.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre there is the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boom of requests for this Friday, with the contention of spending less than 30 euro, to which they responded by adapting their menus for the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of an another group of the most powerful Andilana, with 16 institutions in the city (the Rita, Market, La Fonda and other Hostel), the particularity of the schedule assumed more reservations early, even at the beginning of the month of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices over the past year, with the menus for all tastes of 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a billing since the second half and good growth, although concentrated, perspectives for the Christmas business.
The group sources mention that 18 will also be a foamy day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays in advance.
In their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or as budget more famous and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than the year instead of requiring more detailssuch as the catalan wine made according to the méthode champenoise - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the sensation that the volume of the groups has increased a little.
On the part of employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona), his Vice President, Enric Gomà, gives the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated"even if clients "negotiate up."
This is true, the hope with respect to the festivities had not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produced atomic weapons to "faster" than any other country.
The filtration of Wikileaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy of Pakistan and the United States State Department filtered Portal Wikileaks confirms huge concerns that causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart details illuminating and flavorful on the content of the conversations and thoughts offer diplomatic representatives North American accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of Atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult their destruction attack - is one of the main reasons for worry in Washington.
It is as well as the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne w. Patterson, enumerates in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear including short noise materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of persons involved in nuclear weapons and missile programs is envisaged, not as proliferating step only by the United States, but by the Russia, and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has the hiring of staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities;" "given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who works in nuclear programmes or missile," said Yuri Korolev, the expert of the Ministry of the Russian external during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange Portal is each time more reduced between the United States and Pakistan cooperation in the field of nuclear proliferation and it raised Pakistani degree of production of armas nuclear.
A dispatch from the Embassy in may, which qualifies as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues the following: "transparency is frequently non-existent;" "the offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, officer of the National Intelligence for the South Asia, noted that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan product of nuclear weapons at a faster pace that any other nation of the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked in Washington, during a visit to the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, that he will be "very clearly" understand the head "Of Pakistan army should end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a Senior Manager for the fight against terrorism to prevent new infiltrations.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it dates of November 20.
And it has nothing to even with the last filtration of more than a quarter million of diplomatic documents of the United States but with charges of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator lawyer, Mark Stephens, provides that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
20 The international police force with headquarters at Lyon (France) has dictated the order at request of Sweden, but it has not done public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
So, 188 Interpol countries received the indication to identify or locate Assange "for his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member countries, according to the explanations of the Organization consider the red record a call way free for the arrest - national body of the police must achieve.especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where one thinks that Assange is located.
The movement has outraged Assange counsel, which yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, aged 39, has been prepared to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained the permit to get out of Sweden of the Prosecutor in his case, is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounced the missive.
While the world seeks - and Australia mother defends innocence of her son - Assange continues to be in an unknown location, but is was not.
Monday he gave at an undetermined place an interview to the Director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the United States State, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates spy at the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," said.
His opinion has insulted yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" demand for resignation.
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should interest us," said to the CNN.
Obama himself was responsible for a high official of the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
The test of the spokesman for the President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that the politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, Congressman from January chair the National Security Committee in the lower House has asked the Department of State that he studied the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate funds and prosecute any person" who provide them with assistance or contributions.
Even more far went to Tom Flanagan, an advisor to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has the back his statements after having told Assange will have to "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into objective and user an aircraft without crew or something similar."
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the Presidency.
"Located in the Government which has filtered the information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be too kind punishment," said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will help the party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the Assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, without North due to the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware of the fact that the threat of resignation is not enough for followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted than the liar, and that this may not give him a headache he had with other extinct currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticism with winks to be blinder to the municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercós yesterday announced that more than 200 national advisors to ERC can pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By with ballots, not by raising the hand.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote of penalty to the President, they the can do so without any fear reprisals.
In fact, ranks Chief wants to avoid the image of division and the submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would be consider not ratified with half plus one the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result would "in Bulgarian" be good also.
Persons close to Carod require the President a little more that make position available to militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós control the maxim body between congresses.
But because they lack a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the Executive a roadmap until May.
To do this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document management will submit to the 18 national Council voting.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of the schedule for the fall of 2011 Congress, what leaders consider a fact of course.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to do that once and for all the Organization be able to wash its laundry room family.
In this line, the article that the current Counsellor Josep Huguet was signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, Innovació holder thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if had been.
And he has enumerated five, which he points out two.
The first, "redial" the Executive so that it represents at least 90% of militancy, i.e., include new tricks from Carod enthusiast sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the Assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statute that allows the achievement of the Congress delegates elected by popular vote through.
Finish with the Assembly model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of Puigcercós team, who has already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave 2008 has loaded Directorate revise the Assembly in a specific Conference model of reform of the Statute.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of last years did not recommend that this topic.
Now, without critical sectors to watch, the time could be good for the resume and the close forever.

When one asked about critics of PRI against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years in Government, César Nava has asked the priistes reflect on the six years of former Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo.
"If the PRI believes that the Governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón;" they begin to defend them; "they come out of ' Cabinet," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive may expressions such as he did in his speech in the National audience, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes in Twitter act in favour of undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act legislation, called tus senators and ask them to approve this legislation," a Twitté the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is meeting today to the national mobilization to support the Dream Act legislation, to legalize the students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act legislation, called tus senators and ask them to approve this legislation," a Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains open a cybernetic link with a further document which asks the public to immediately contact the Senators for voting legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that hopefully soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the time of Bush tax cuts and funding from the Government extend.
Such blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the Act Dream Act vote and other projects such as the ratification of the new start with the Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned on Republican blocking of the Dream Act legislation and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that he is confident that once the fiscal problem is resolved will be establishing an agency for the remainder of the projects.
"I think that is a lot of time..."
"We are all agreed that need this tax problem before the end of the year..."

The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would seek a "vote of closure of the debate" for Dream Act legislation, reason why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be passed from the Thursday next in the Senateeven if the most likely would be next week.
Senate Dream Act version or the American dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people happened in the United States before the age of 16 years, they remained in this country the past five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, reason for which they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, in moments where the protagonists project partisan organizations intense lobbying to ensure approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.

With the literature you put his finger on the wound
The second stage of the pleasures of language has been a walk in which participants flaunted the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound?" that hopefully me? ," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited a open the second phase of the pleasures of language, a cycle which celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time has used the subtitle of his question (during another show the round table was dedicated to gender in the language) " (, a explained it).
"" Finger on the wound..." met us on the spot," has launched gently argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the fair international book of Guadalajara (wire) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and was attended by ValenzuelaSergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as that protagonist who seeks what the "wound," it will a doctor to anotherwithout getting a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectious diseases specialist she leaves satisfied: "patience is not my fort, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologue who cut his breath in the corridor, but explaining him that wound is not a scientific term; It is the psychoanalyst uncovers the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on the wound only I know that it is really being open and that it does not exist," but satisfied the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be very connected between them.
Valenzuela, writer, played with the two.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a lovely narration entitled praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not number but at a given time is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous ensorceleuse who touched clouds, was to return people who were gone far or repaired virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the big news has had from the beginning its own columnists and cita to Bernal Díaz del Castillo that critical the excesses of the narratives of the conquer capitans.
"Cervantes who invented we all (writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but of an aitre way the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the indecent assault have never told."
However, has pointed out there, "fools and Liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converge with the lie, no one knows how much of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reached its peak.
It's called in the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is with his inheritance is what is storytelling."
In turn, Mayra Montyero writer annotated and applauded the variety of interpretation caused by the invitation of the wire with its Roundtable must on the wound.
The Cuban Puerto Rican has put hers on the large wound of social violence facing his country - and the Latin America share - product of the disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry good songs contain an implied undertaking that is not of course premeditated," has indicated it, quote after that the reality of literature is the communication and the size of the undertaking which is established between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "it must on the wound of the engaged writer."
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also in relating the intellectual habits and the control of consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every statement there is a small non- and behind each denial, there is a small Yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and the masters of reality, we need to qualify: and qualify means many times put his finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in cartoons"," in black and white, established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers who prefer a black and white world," said, inviting them to retrieve the sense to write.
Romano to the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals there ups and downs in his career, but he was able to achieve three times the decisive set.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are more two different styles facing, marked by their technicians, who find a marked by the results contrast between them.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, there has been ups and downs in his career, but he was able to achieve three times the decisive set, even if so far it has not put in the mile and it is for this that this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine eventually comfort with the sous-champion Medal, he remained a step behind the winners, and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
Santiste strategist arrived in its first final as a coach in opening 2002 tournament when he took the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca. later, in the end of 2003 he also came to the decisive duel and lost again with the overall outcome of 3-1 and was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, in the bicentenary 2010 tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, his team made a match equal to 2-2 against the ñora after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he obtained an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and eventually three of its players have missed 11 metres and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he will not have the same fate, he tries to detach from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first timeeven if he says that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, step for a passion that I have and therefore I get the title, but what I have mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when he was asked what would be its weak points in the finals.
He recalls many of the last final, which he assures that he has learned much, "the single lesson that we can remember it is only until the referee whistles the end, we do not celebrate, we are prepared in the line"," players also, because the last time, with two penalties to pull we were already prepared to run and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game could not celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which concerned not about him, because he trusts in his players: "it is never sought to arrive at the series of penalties, trying to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we are that prepare us"," we have been prepared the previous tournament, unfortunately fate has made a wrong turn, sometimes emotions or anxiety to keep the title in our hands, hands he escaped us, this has served us as lesson for this final and we hope that it happens more in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity not to be a sous-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by titles.

14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A decade of searches were conducted in the Eastern Townships, on Wednesday, during the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
Searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used in drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used in the production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two minds of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges for the production of cannabis, possession to trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were held following a lengthy investigation, which lasted just about a year.
"It is of information received from the public which allowed these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the regional survey of the Eastern Townships of Quebec security module, the police of Sherbrooke and the Memphremagog police Board Service, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problem
The Bill of the conservatives who, according to the Government, should address the problem of vessels responsible for clandestine migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties have been whether Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand upright with a party that has created the granite beneath your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by members of Parliament after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals argue that the Bill as proposed, would hold up to one year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms.
The head of the Bloc québécois, Gilles Duceppe, said that he could not support the Bill, because it is the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then it will be seen that the Government will," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NDP immigration critic, Olivia Chow, was dismissed from the back of the hand critics wishing that his party is not enough firm regarding illegal immigrants.
"Democrats are agreed for action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we do through an another Bill, C - 35," said Ms Chow.
"We don't support the Bill of the Conservatives because he took in refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explained Ms. Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties to play policy and ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target the Canada and dealing with the country as a doormat."
"They expect that the Canada takes firm measures," Minister Kenney responded.
The Government has not announced a confidence vote on his Bill, which could lead the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
However, a conservative said the QMI agency that the Government would seek a vote so that each Member who opposed then explained to his voters.
The new unit is not unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the creation of a commission of public inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of public safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of New York Investigation on this matter as early as last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Tuesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that a meeting of the permanent Council on police services in Quebec, on October 29, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was not needed for that critic PQ public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, described the announcement of "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution bricolée on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil has he responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You'll see the result when we will announce it, merely to say."
"It is aware of this issue."
The President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Premier Charest obstinately not to want to create this commission of inquiry, most people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains he Yves Boisvert, Professor of ethics and governance at the national school of public administration.
To break this deadlock, he therefore suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate to the Auditor General to inquire into collusion and corruption.
"It must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he decides.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in cartons of the Charest government.
Quebec also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Attorney for operation hammer, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of public security, Vic Toews, has he confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently examines some of the amendments related to this folder.
In operation spring 2001, that was biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa was subsequently adopt the Act on the gangsterism.

DuPont partially blamé
The Quebec Stéphane Dupont radio host suffered a partial setback to the Canadian Council of the broadcast standards (CCNR) to words controversial social assistance and the Haitian and his foul language on the air.
The CBSC considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain comments contained "incorrect on social assistance information," unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language which is not suitable for broadcast during the day.
The Council also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who were suicide, did not contravene the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales of Quebec.
The Group complained that the amounts referred to in the show were inaccurate.
Facilitators must be solid information not misleading.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont found that suicide is a gesture of coward.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that episodes"Dupont"implicated midi addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate."
No blame was therefore chosen in his place.
The last issue was statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media bites which had aroused many reactions.
The host of CHOI stated that he had no gift to help Haitians because could not know with certainty that needy people actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my suspension of three days on this."
"My record is blank for a year and a half," said the host.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounced the diffusion of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond his duty."
The consequences are minimal for the station to, among others, announce these decisions once during primetime hours within a period of three days.

Hydro-Québec granted private $ 450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more of 100 contracts, it is a consortium of the firms OPI, Dessau, group SM and Axor who obtained the most important, stewardship of the project, for a sum of 295 million without tender.
This consortium called energy stewardship was formed in 2004 concomitantly the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector's responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $ 5 billion.
In early 2005, the energy stewardship consortium won the lucrative contract without that there has been public tender.
For the Parti québécois, the consortia of companies use poses a serious ethical problem that is likely to eliminate competition and lead to a rise in the price.
"It is the new way to collusion and shoot competition."
"That is that people, rather than do it in secret way, now the make open manner," said Sylvain Simard péquiste Member Press Conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he difficult to see how the public interest can be used this way.
The Minister of natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I begin to have my trip," was where, arguing that the PQ was "dishonest" and had "lack of rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortia is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies consolidate their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project involves a high level of complexity in view of the magnitude of the work.
The site is underway and must be spread until 2012.
However, the contract has been awarded the game of the competition act; There was negotiation.
Also, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As week last Le Devoir revealed, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is investigated object to the Government.
A quick overview of the register of companies of Quebec to count more than 200 consortia, some appear to be permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other rock and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to one and same legal entity, or Dessau.
For what is energy management Consortium, Minister Normandeau said that "the territory of James Bay meets specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec responds in a particular way for the years ' 70.
The great pattern of the Eastmain, Réal Laporte project, énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) society, gave an explanation that raises eyebrows on the fact that the management of the project agreement awarded over-the-counter.
"If you're going to in tender and there are few bidders, your price will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take people who are in this market there and you say: we will negotiate an agreement with a good price and satisfying."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the jurisdiction of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium for energy stewardship is part of a long list of contracts over $ 50,000 obtained by the Parti québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec and SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has counted 109 engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including laboratories for soil.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in energy stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including contract energy stewardship $ 295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard has been suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, group SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that the "Fund," before specifying that it was rather of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - the "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer trusted very few actors of sustainable development, but also fair marks and écologisantes certifications to guide its selection.
Worse, even if it is bathed in a media universe where messages more responsible consumption abound, it deplored a lack of credible information, waiting what he calls even brake its commitment, indicates the barometer of responsible consumption, of which the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible 2010 products, Quebecers seem however to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds say indeed did not believe the environmental business engagement just as green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the responsible consumption of the Sherbrooke University Observatory.
Another realization: half of consumers question the reliability of official certifications affixed fair products, but of the credibility of products and brands is displaying as flyers, indicates the barometer.
In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumption information seems essential to stimulate this lively consumption pan currently by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of information result the zeal of 46% of consumers.
It is the second brake identified by the barometer, after the price of these products.
Furthermore, one third of Quebecers say they are also wary towards the alleged performance of products or services green sought to put their hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed brand to one or more products to meet their belief.
Up to 61%, they have also encouraged purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, indicates the barometer.
More green and responsible - responsible consumption index reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year-, Homo consumus Quebec enjoys as the King of recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint with a concern for the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological awareness however seems to stay out of his car, indicates the barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers have indicated having used public transportation or carpooling have advocated for their green interests.
The walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this major behavioural investigation, which has just taken his first shadow copy.
A loan from the State for the redemption of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who are asked to commit financially in the redemption of the complex of film eXcentris by the Angus society and the parallel, agrees to cooperate, but competition from a loan only.
The Société de développement Angus and the parallel, who hoped to a donation of $ 7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois complex film eXcentris on Saint-Laurent boulevard in him restoring its full sensibilities vocationdo not get what they wanted.
The Government agrees to get involved in the folder, but on its own terms.
Rather that expected donation, the Government of Québec offers a loan amount would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the State pharmacies from sources.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre from the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, pilot eXcentris folder.
He sent him a final report 10 days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet came to SODEC Tuesday.
The parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems however that the hypothesis of the gift of the State should really be excluded.
Remember that the Association of owners of cinemas and Quebec cinéparcs opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture is not to finance real estate projects, what he did for other movie theatres.
But instead, several stakeholders claimed substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, victimized, has 10 years worn tipped arm author cinema in its premises of the complex after having financed itself in its construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its customer base.
Angus society and the parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, fly, on their side, a fundraising campaign to the private sector, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of three screens, the parallel, continuing to broadcast movies at eXcentris.
The purpose of the future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois of men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini recalled Le Devoir and it is unknown what he and his group think proposals that take them down.
The veil lifted on a complexed Canada...
New American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks shed light on what the United States consider the complex of inferiority toward the Americans, but they betray the same time the sense of superiority of the latter towards the Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter is not Canadian-American relations in mind from voting and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the Conservative Government to adopt his budget in 2009!
Four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread on the public square yesterday, offer more crispy details substantial content to the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in full federal election campaign, tells how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American Ambassador stationed in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex conditioned perhaps Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of daily life rather than to wear this election on the United States (as in the campaign on the free trade of 1988) ," he wrote.
The United States are, therefore, concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak about."
Ambassador includes much less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, believe, the ability of a candidate of a party and still more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
Another expression of this feeling of significance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing the President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the Government in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which the Canada will display its first deficit in over a decade because of a 30-40 billion stimulus plan"writes M. Breese.
Nowhere is there mention that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid be overthrown by the coalition and the opposition parties made them conditional survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington of the image more in more negative drama series broadcast on CBC return to United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No.-Fly-List" or abductions for questioning yet muscular of the CIA.
Another cable tells that, in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some of the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay.
Mr. Kouchner responded yes, but on the basis of the "case."
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he presented a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a Muslim from 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary has agreed to review the file."
Finally, note that the spirits are heated on the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former close advisor to Stephen Harper, said on-air CBC that the head of the massive leak should be "murdered."
It is the echo of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancún a domestic, commercial and industrial lighting renovation plan in 100 countries to obtain a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which is almost one third of the additional reduction that should be performed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments of reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs which still monopolize 50-70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light bulbs to LEDs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to inform humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major emitting countries, as the United States, China, Europe and others, including the Canada engaged in voluntary reduction plans should be 49 Gt 53 Gt GHG emissions.
But will subtract this balance sheet still 5 Gt it became out of control to stabilize climate at 2 degrees centigrade increase by 2020 to avoid.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat, and the rest is 5%, produced light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new light bulbs to DEL, reduces the need of energy in two once again.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
New led bulbs, such as those launched the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the study of the UN-, have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs may also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have posted reserves at the place of compact fluorescent bulbs since they contain mercury and must be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But the report, the main source of emission of mercury on the planet is not the bulb compact fluorescent, but rather the thermal coal-fired plants, which emit lots of mercury for the generation of electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States only, these power plants emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through the international program.
For example, the Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects nervousness the announcement of election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, called the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the deadlines set.
"The Secretary General stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce interim results without further delay, said a spokesman for the Chief of the United Nations."
"It asks all the Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative up to the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign Governments, the electoral commission has missed date deadline of Wednesday Midnight without publish results, three days after the vote on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the period, the Chairman of the CIS had said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world that the CIS proclaims finally the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent, Alassane Ouattara.
But Gbagbo's camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the North, held by the ex-rébellion of the new Forces (FN) since the failed September 2002 coup.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian President Campaign Manager, said that the intimidation of voters manoeuvres performed by the forces NOUVELLES in the North of the country had discouraged supporters of outgoing President to vote.
The election could be set aside if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo opponents believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao did Dwv, a close ally political Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North which denies any connection with the former rebels, found "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to abide by them, but he went up to claim victory.
Allies say that Gbagbo blocks publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that wear complaint before the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, Sunday, was supposed to top the process of reunification and reconciliation of remained country split in two years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the international Bureau of labour (ILO) has remained stable to 9,3% in Metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), show data corrected for seasonal variations (CVS) interim published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed stood at 2,631 million in metropolitan France.
Second-quarter data were confirmed to 9.3% of the workforce in metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
On a year, the unemployment rate is displayed in 0.1 point increase.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of the young present on the labour market again deteriorated, with new rise in unemployment, increased to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 point in three months, + 0.5 point on one year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors were known for their part a slight increase in unemployment, 6.4% in metropolitan France (+ 0.2 point on three months as well as a year), either 482,000 people of 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49 years benefited stability of unemployment in the third quarter to 8.3% in metropolitan France (0.1 point on three-month, + 0.1 point on one year) and 8.8% in the France.
Insee published more rate monthly unemployment since 2006, after a controversy on its method of calculation.
However, Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for the France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years, waste treatment business leader and brother of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches, was indicted and imprisoned at home for a stay of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged procurement fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social goods, diversion of funds and public goods, possession of stolen property, bribery, influence peddling and detention of ammunition, said his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wishes to explain all the issues that the magistrate will ask and no fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible heads, it is another thing to prove," told AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, prior to the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the Department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, through its counsel, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo to be explained.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also under investigation Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than operating landfills that he had to manage.
As to the allocation of markets or the destination of the funds tied to their functioning, he never did knowledge, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of services of the town of Aubagne, was put under investigation Wednesday for embezzling public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with prohibition to meet with the protagonists of the folder.
"My client was able provide explanations to the facts alleged against him."
"The magistrate has taken into account by does not liberty depriving him," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been in review and rehabilitated in freedom on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial supervision for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General at the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "passive bribery and influence peddling."
Two officials of the town of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted for "subtraction and misappropriation of public property by a responsible person of a public service mission," and another for "complicity of embezzlement of public funds."
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was made in consideration for "concealment of abuse of social goods."
Among those who have faced Mr. Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect that its companies have been used to launder money from organized crime.
The investigation is conducted in several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
Source close the investigation, the investigations focus on the terms and conditions and operating a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects waste of Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case of Clotilde Reiss: Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of the Syria
During more than pendant plus de dix ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying," held breath in France opinion, put diplomacy on the alert, and exacerbated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde revealed some below of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained his strategy to the Americans, up to offer advice for the treatment of their own crises to "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the French young did not have to return the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and wanted by the American justice for trafficking of materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a stark light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle cases of hostages."
The Elysee for Strategic Affairs Adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for the North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, to maintain with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own citizens retained strength in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "martelez ever" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
Needed to embarrass the regime Iranian, sensitive to its image.
"Do as the Iranians ask you to do" it.
Because past attempts at discussion by discrete channels, "silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage to blackmail policy."
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will speak on August 16, day where she sought refuge at the Embassy of France) will "require the payment to the Iranians for a large sum of money" (230 000 euros bail).
And he indicated that the Elysee anticipates to other hostage crises, a phenomenon which "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in a future close stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for twelve days, but remains stuck in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the United States seek extradition for illegal traffic of sensitive electronic equipment, to the Iran released in Paris, on decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, as many observers wondered about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which hunts Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
The France accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, said, was not only "was completely taken by surprise by the decision of the judge," but sought to oppose.
"There were heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot go back on the decision" judicial, observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains placed under the "narrow" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee Advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the diplomat American that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee household not its efforts, through press releases and "leaks" in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played an "important" and "influential" of "mediator" role.
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and recognize that manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles reflected the French official version.
"The ' blitz' media of French officials" refers to a telegram dated August 25, 2009.
On what is based both in "appreciation" expressed to Mr. Assad, asked the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians were actually."
The document then examines the reasons that pushed the Elysee to pay in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "is intended to validate the policy of opening to the Syria Sarkozy," analyzes it.
Policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by of many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to the Syria praise what it can to attract by playing a constructive role in the region."
The objective is also to "sow seeds of discord between the Syria and the Iran."
The US Embassy knows of good source.
August 11, François Richier entrusted: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we've thanked them still."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received at the Élysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the Presidents of the Brazil, Senegal, and the Syria, for their "active role for the release of our countryman."
Not for young Korean online games past midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a so-called law "of Cinderella" that prohibit teens play games online after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A Bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online games companies block access to these games after midnight, to young people aged less than 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties to study at the school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this Act is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," told the AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the Bill.
Online games will be again available at 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the Act, he said.
The Government also plans to ask companies to limit the time for daily access to these games for young people whose parents so request, added the head.
It will also make available to people who claim the free software that allow to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online games competitions.
In November, the Korea of the South had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: Fifa means the organizing countries
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates Thursday countries organisers sections of the world 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying may take on technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the competition Queen of Fifa 2018 Edition will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or in the far East (Japan, Korea South).
The list of personalities making part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of a global political and economic issues.
Behind the scenes negotiations may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of Fifa, the English records, hispano-portugais (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations not very weigh heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which has hosted the world only oncein 1966.
The BBC in handed a layer, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary which pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What anger Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who embarked on an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the Government hopes to republish the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for the Organization of the JO-2012 London.
This intense activity will suffice to re-brand of England with the EC?
Nothing is less secure because the Spain-Portugal duo is no shortage of assets with its ready stages, expertise (82-world in Spain, Barcelona, Euro-2004 in the Portugal OJ-92) and football culture.
But the dark Economic Outlook and financial of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
Reprisal against the English and the doubts about the solvency of the Spain and the Portugal that raise the rating of the Russia, become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of his record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make travel to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in an allusion barely veiled charges of press English against the members of this.
"It covers mud, trying to jeopardize," launched Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong experience in 1994, appears as the logical favourites.
First world economic power, headquarters of the major sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a head start on the Japan and South Korea, who built a beautiful project separately.
But these new entries appear premature for two countries having co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of global-2026 to China, fervently desired by Fifa, which would in fact deciduous Asian opportunities for 2022.
With the Qatar, which released the game offering futuristic stadiums, and the Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion towards new lands, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
The Australia, such as the Japan and the Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights (because of lag) paid by European countries, the sinews of war for Fifa.
Second term: obviously
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made believe that he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they.
A term in the Elysee calls another.
Therefore, the current head of State will be candidate in 2012.
But obviously does not mix with the share of mystery attached to the Presidential Office.
Then it should be as if the doubt always exist.
In a sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would take his decision "somewhere in the fall of the year 2011."
That he evokes with UMP parliamentarians Tuesday night at the Elysee "two terms" perspective thus sowed a bit of excitement.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far away.
The President did that recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 was limited to two the number of periods.
It was an observation, not an advertisement.
This is not the first time that it evokes the presidential election on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still for seven and a half years with me," had launched them in July 2009.
Repeat in May 2010: "Do not believe that I have not thought about the step after."
His words of the day before yesterday do the make no more candidate than the day before; they do no less.
If they give rise to comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination to the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry finalists for Ségolène Royal that grows Nicolas Sarkozy to disclose.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious to the PS claimed a last in order of battle earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there was no discussion on this UMP," was immediately and cautiously reacted to the entourage of Prime Minister.
"He believes the possible defeat, there is no candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He believes still to win," corrects Alain Juppé resigned himself to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of Government securities
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the terms of crisis or, at least, to announce the decision of a good number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which must be achèver at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis requires, issuance of Frankfurt Institute probably cannot afford to be as peremptory under penalty of a more that tense situation worse today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be particularly high in.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, thus welcomed the active role played by the ECB for the resolution of the crisis of the debts of the States in Europe.
She did not wish say if she believed that the Central Bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection in my partners Europeans (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the commission of affairs economic and currency of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been more disert as to its intentions, merely to indicate that the program for the purchase of Government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" the meeting on Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of treasuries by the ECB have doubled last week, to about 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, expectations for a continuation of purchases is no doubt (see page 29).
Not more economists do expect significant change of course.
If the operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still unlimited cash allowances on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect today that this device be extended a few months.
"I can't imagine that it significantly alters its program."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short-term," said Michael Schubert, Economist of Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 it is likely," anticipates his side Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the market of public debt, "The ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to animate a lacklustre market," added Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exhibitions of European sovereign debt markets, banks the issuing Institute of euro-zone has no other choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It at any price substitute for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent a runaway of the yield paid by the most fragile States," represented an important Bond Manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, States will be even more embarrassed to reduce their indebtedness, otherwise the stabilize.
The protection of the euro is the price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi Government made the round back
After a start to the week worrying situation for the Italy, it is a little relaxed, yesterday, with reflux of the 10-year bond rates.
A return to the quiet precarious.
After a meeting with the Minister of the economy, the Chairmen of region said hearing Giulio Tremonti characterize the situation of "indecipherable" and to expect an "unpredictable" weekend, that the person concerned has subsequently denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the award of contracts for hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) was launched to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he is "strongly concerned" by "the market turbulence" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that the Italy, third euro-zone economy, is not like the Greece or the Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like the Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, Economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, his problem is the lack of growth and atony of the tax revenues that goes with, making the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs in the State.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the Government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... then the budget under consideration in the Senate table on respectively 1.3% and 2%.
In these circumstances, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will again represent 4.3% of the GDP next year (against 3.9% provided by the Government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Where the rumour of a new budgetary collective that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, of new austerity measures must be taken," believes the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, the Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The economic fundamentals are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat for a long time," provides Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the international monetary fund in charge of the Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, nor on the short or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, Editor's note), requested the Italy stabilization efforts are lower than those requested in other countries"observes Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist of the OECD.
Remains the question of political instability.
December 14, Silvio Berlusconi faces a motion of censure in the House of Deputies, whereupon the elections could be held end of March.
Will then open a period not conducive to decision-making in a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the strengthening of the anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still said it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "the Europeans, I think that still demonstrated Sunday in the day and night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currencies and their monetary zone."
Although any relative relaxation recorded yesterday on European government bond rates brought water to the mill of Governments and of the ECB.
But it cannot yet speak of a beginning of standardization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it would degrade the note of the Portugal, the target debt today by speculation.
"As in may, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, notably on banking systems," believe the Exane BNP Paribas economists.
As "political time is much slower than the time to market."
Aware of this gap and the dangers that it contains, European countries intensified discussions to strengthen already existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the Ministers directly concerned finance and, more broadly, with their peers of the G20 are well underway.
And in view also of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin of the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
In the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures of support to the countries of the eurozone in the crosshairs of the markets (see above).
As the European financial stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday to Singapore a tour of Asia to inform life investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares in the ground.
The first titles of the EFSF emissions are planned next month.
Yesterday, a US official representative entrusted to the Reuters news agency that the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
The countries which are in first line, the Portugal and Spain, for their part, are ready to adopt structural reforms, notably in the Organization of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to nearest effect austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of the Greece and the Ireland.
The one and the other held at all costs to avoid requesting aid establish their own budgetary patch and decide indispensable structural reforms to restore long-term confidence.
European donors, finally, to maintain on the options available to expedite the process of standardization of the markets of sovereign obligations.
Visiting Paris, November 24, Axel Weber was the first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the international monetary fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand to the portfolio.
Economists for Barclays Capital, a player in first plan of the sovereign debt market European, feel that an extension of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European mechanism for financial stabilization has, to date, EUR 60 billion.
A Council which is likely to be carefully considered in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions seafarers.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snowy episodes still cause difficulties of traffic, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure and Loir, Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to weather France, supported snow showers affect the North of the Gironde and the Charentes and weakly snow Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from time to time from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, the Poitou and those of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to create difficulties of traffic and disrupt certain economic activities, prevents weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several départementales were banned to the heavy weight of more than 7.5 tonnes, of which the axes Lannion-Guingamp and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult as the gendarmes who recommend not to take his vehicle only when necessary and some TER cars traffic was suspended for the day.
School transport have been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was considered Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The Prefecture "Invites all motorists to caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
Directorate General of civil aviation (DGCA) has asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights to Paris from Roissy airport and 10% at Orly because of upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, the airport of Gatwick, South of London, and Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate about the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France in full swing, the billion raining down.
In the discussion at least.
It evokes in particular 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris that must build the society of Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State announced a capital of EUR 4 billion endowment.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount which will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, there is finally the first additions.
Act amending finance 2010, examined in the Committee on Finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices provided to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase in tax offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, reads in the text of the Bill, section 15, "for the benefit of the society of the great Paris public establishment."
It is encrypted: "the proceeds of this tax is € 117 million per year."
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize, increase product and affect this increase to the society of the great Paris."
This would bring how?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
It is 4 billion.
"It is stated that these fiscal resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and to the Paris Grand society as the project," can be read in the explanatory memorandum.
At the GSP is not this shocking system.
"Can cover studies on three years from the time it created recipes (the two taxes, Editor's note), then type in the 4 billion after, explains."
"This will be part of the budget and fired at the as."
The GSP estimated that 4 billion will begin to be recorded in 2013 to 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, can cause a little agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Revenge and spyware hackers in care
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal before the hypocrisy which governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other, she announces changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression.
But proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is the confirmation of each record by a secret service (of any nation whatsoever) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
"Extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi do that report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the eerily caricature profile of Khadafi was long for cabaret material sketch artists.
The rule that documents must be composed only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Knights Templar or the Rosicrucians) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And not only because the author of occult texts do not like to do original research (or knows where to look on the non-existent News), but because those who committed to the occult believe that what they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise it may be that know I, editor of release), which holds as true as what it recognizes.
Top secret information about Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week of before.
Then why have revelations about these folders the both noise?
On the one hand they say that every cultured person knows that the embassies, at least since the end of the second world war, and that the heads of States can to call or take a plane to meet at dinnerhave lost their diplomatic function, and the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer survey movies very well knows this, and is by hypocrisy that is pretended to ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place under bad light American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that a hacker any can capture the secrets of the most secret of the most powerful country of the world bears a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also scandal does not so much crisis victims "workaholics."
But I turn to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of Orwell, could develop any power as a Big Brother who controlled every action of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely proved since that can control each movement with the phone, each completed transaction, visited hotel, borrowed Highway and on, the citizen was becoming the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now that even the Crypts of the secrets of the power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the - elected as Avenger of the citizen - hacker, can know all the secrets of the power.
How a power that no longer has able to keep its own secrets can take?
It is true, Georg Simmel the said already, that a true secret is an empty (and empty secret will never be disclosed); It is true, also, that know everything about the character of Berlusconi and Merkel is actually an empty secret, because the public domain; but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did no wrong Merkel or Sarkozy, but was too large to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of the injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will no longer put any information reserved - online would publish it on a poster pasted on the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is fruitless to hope to maintain the confidential reports by phone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of State has moved in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future private and reserved reports?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is the responsibility of the science fiction and therefore fiction, but I am compelled to imagine the Government agents who travel discretely in due diligence to uncontrollable routes, by being carriers of messages learned by heart orat most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in drawers closed key: at the bottom, the attempt to spy on the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the chance to write that the technology is now advancing in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, Internet restored a Telegraph (telephone) son.
(Analog) video tapes had enabled film researchers explore a movie step by going forward and backward and in discovering all the secrets of the montage, while now the (digital) CD allow to jump to chapter Chapter, by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, it goes from Rome to Milan, in three hours then in aircraft, and travel that it includes, it must be three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communications technology go back to the horse cars.
A last observation.
Formerly, the press was trying to understand what is going in the secret of embassies.
At present, these are embassies requesting confidential information to the press.
Climate: how the France hack its promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine compliance with the promise of rapidly débloqués financing (so-called fast start financing or early) made by developed countries.
And the large French I are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and the France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million per year).
Opening of the COP16, the EU has released the game to persuade its partners in the reality of his commitment on fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, great side event, distribution of brochures...
Operation transparency is appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like that all developed countries do the same with a similar level of precision.
EU Announces cleared in 2010 to€ 2.2 billion, which puts it on the right road for the respect of its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be based on the agreement in Copenhagen, "new and additional," to ensure that an additional effort is carried out without being at the expense of development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, some members including the France States have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that fits him best.
The European Commission considered for example as a reference year 2009: international financing are kept, and it adds 150 million over three years to the title of the fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of development assistance.
In contrast, the France believes that "all new projects" funding of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years spending or the overall level of development assistance.
In practical terms, the total amount of the support of the France in developing countries may remain stable (or even lower), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another critical element, the distribution between loans and donations.
Here again, there is no rule and each selects its method of calculation.
Some, such as the France, consider that €1 on loan equals €1 given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments which are cost-effective (often), it is disingenuous to present a euro will recover as equivalent to the euro is... At most, should be counted in respect of commitments that the cost of the loan for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But the France does that make such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by 91.5% of loans (EUR 389,8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see document of the EU to verify for yourself.
It is the only country of the Union to use the loan so massively.
The Germany are requires to 46%, while the Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, the France does that 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice sleight Tower!
In summary, in its fast start funding, the France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, she comes to believe that she spend 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems it's Bercy which has completed arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both in the EU (why the other Member States continue to give whether it is sufficient to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early financing is just a small question, relative short term, all of the discussions on the climate.
But it might be a grain of sand in addition in the huge machine of the UNFCCC.
Hope that this will not be the case.
In any event, it is essential to draw the lessons from this first year of early financing.
First of all, the France could announce a change in the way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But most importantly, the France could advance the discussions on the issues of financing long term (currently discussed other crucial chapter): it will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for the loans.
The France could change its position to become also progressive on these issues as it is on other.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
An announcement surprised on the fast start of the France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be increasing the level of international confidence to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years ingests day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published Wednesday of association generations Futures (ex-movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warned that its results "have no significant statistical value for the low number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the treated problem," purchased between July and September foods typically consumed four meals and a snack in one day by a child of ten yearsin supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These meal types, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - and candy, were examined by laboratories for chemical substances, pesticides, metals, heavy and other pollutants.
The base is overwhelming: 81 chemicals including 42 are classified carcinogenic potential or probable and five substances classified carcinogenic some and 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the international Centre for research on cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern"note the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain them only more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as some carcinogens and to nearly 20 residues that could disrupt the hormone system.
Apple, imported from the Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, presents traces of six chemicals which a fungicide yet prohibited in France.
Same thing for beans green of the Kenya, which is included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and baguette of bread and chewing gum were peppered for pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, steak from salmon was the more "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the review of the base plastic used to warm the meal in the microwave was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance of Europe ecology - the Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "to the urgency of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to halt "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency for food security (EFSA) was the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
