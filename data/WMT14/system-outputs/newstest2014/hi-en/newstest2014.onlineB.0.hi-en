Frontier Airlines carry-on baggage will charge
Frontier Airlines baggage for passengers on board the aircraft in carry-on store plans to charge $ 100.
Frontier एयरलाइंस में एक कैरी - ऑन बैग के लिए $100  के लिए चार्ज शुरू करने की योजना है और यह, कॉफी या सोडा के लिए$2 का शुल्क लगाएंगे,  हालांकि  बुधवार को इसकी घोषणा  ने बताया कि यात्री संपूर्ण डिब्बा रख सकते हैं.
The new carry-on fees for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bag under the seat still free will.
Frontier said it will charge $ 25 if paid in advance, the passenger will have to wait to pay $ 100 to wait until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $ 100 fee charged in advance to take care of people to achieve.
"We do not want the charge," he said.
Airlines in 2008 started charging for first and second checked bags.
जो जो यात्री शुल्क से बचने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं  भराई कर रहे हैं जितना वे कर सकते हैं  कैरी - ऑन बैगेज में जो ओवरहेड डिब्बे में स्टैश है , इसका मतलब है इस डिब्बे में अक्सर कम जगह है.
The fee for passengers on board a way to get lower.
O'Malley said the new charges is not really about raising money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers has become increasingly difficult to find overhead bin space.
Airline passengers who buy tickets on their website does not give it.
इसका मतलब है यही कारण है कि लाइन में अगले व्यक्ति को एक समान बैग के लिए 100 डॉलर देना हो सकता है, जबकि एक फ्रंटियर गेट पर लाइन में एक यात्री, एक बैग मुफ़्त प्राप्त कर सकते हैं.
ओ 'मैली ने कहा कि Frontier की वेबसाइट और चेक इन के प्रक्रियाओं को बदल दिया जा रहा है गेट को पाने से पहले यात्रियों को फीस के बारे में पता है यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए.
Frontier's new carry-on fees, will not begin until summer, although a date has not been set.
Travelers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but the airline they prefer.
वे तर्क देते हैं कि बैगेज को संभालने के लिए पैसा खर्च होता है, और जो यात्री सेवा चाहते हैं  उन को इसके लिए भुगतान करना चाहिए.
वॉल स्ट्रीट पर  बैगेज की फीस एक संकेत के रूप में कई देख रहे हैं कि कई एयरलाइन घाटे के वर्षों के बाद हवाई यात्रा की लागत को कवर करने के लिए पर्याप्त पैसे चार्ज कर रहे हैं.
Although most of the carry-on bag fees are not touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. The carry-on fee first started three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Such a fee as well as other airline Wizz Air of Hungary, which said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, and the add-on fees folders track.
He said the Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $ 50 million a year to the December 2011 report estimated.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines Spirit recently flew passengers at the gate and carry-on bag fees have suffered unusual wondered.
"Boarding process was seamless, which I saw in his airline career," he said.
Gnash and I was hoping to see a fight outside the gate.
"The plane was full and they said it was up lickety-split."
Frontier also coffee, tea, soda, or juice for the Spirit 'is following the $ 2 fee.
Frontier said that the passenger soda, or juice can replace the entire box, and it will give free coffee refills.
It will even give away water.
US एयरवेज संक्षेप में 2008 में पेय पदार्थों के लिए चार्ज करने की कोशिश की, लेकिन यात्रियों के शिकायत के बाद सात महीनों बाद में वे पीछे हट गए और कोई भी अन्य मुख्य एयरलाइन वहाँ होने के बाद का पालन किया.
Frontier's  के यात्री अगर एयरलाइन से सीधे खरीद नहीं करते हैं तो कैरी - ऑन पर शुल्क चार्ज करने के लिए Frontier के यह कदम  अपने स्वयं के वेबसाइट के प्रति ग्राहकों को  संचालित करने के अपने ताजा प्रयास है.
Airlines Orbitz online travel seller pays the $ 10 to $ 25 each way for tickets sold.
यही कारण है कि सारे एयरलाइंस एक ऑनलाइन ट्रैवल एजेंसी के माध्यम से जाने के बजाय उन लोगों से सीधे खरीदने के लिए यात्रियों को संचालित करने के लिए एक प्रोत्साहन दिया गया है.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, putting many frequent flier miles than half of these individuals to those clients who had bought from an online travel agency
It mile trip mileage awards on Wednesday slashed by 25 percent.
So, an online travel agency Frontier purchased a 1,000 mile trip will earn 250 miles.
Frontier also that they buy directly from the website only allows passengers to select their seat in advance.

Scientists shed light on the subject and the antics of the dog's tail and the relationship between mood.
Previous research has shown that much happier dog shake their tails to the right (from the dog's point of view), while the restless dog shaking its tail are mainly left over.
लेकिन अब वैज्ञानिकों का कहना है कि साथी कुत्ते पूंछ के इस सूक्ष्म भेद को पहचान सकते हैं और उस पर अपनी प्रतिक्रिया व्यक्त कर सकते हैं।
The study has been published in the Journal Krnt Bayloji.
Georgia neuroscientist and professor at the University of Trento Vellrtigra said: "In humans it is well known that the brain's left and right part of the stimulus individually include ways to generate positive or negative feelings
Here we have tried to look at other species.
उन्होंने बताया कि मनुष्यों की तरह कुत्तों में भी मस्तिष्क का दायाँ भाग बाएँ हाथ की हरकतों और विपरीत क्रम के लिए जिम्मेदार था, और दो गोलार्द्धों ने भावनाओं में अलग-अलग भूमिकाएं निभाई।
इस बारे में अधिक जानने के लिए कि कुत्ते अन्य कुत्तों द्वारा एकतरफा दुम हिलाने पर कैसे प्रतिक्रिया करते हैं, अनुसंधानकर्ताओं ने अन्य कुत्तों की फिल्में देखते जानवरों पर नज़र रखी।
He measured pet dogs and their behavior analyzed in a heartbeat.
We probably will not take long to understand that why Shaking his tail is sometimes one side, sometimes on the other side.
PRO.वेल्लरटिगरा ने बताया: "हमने कुत्तों को कुत्तों की फिल्मों के साथ पेश किया - यथार्थवादी संस्करण में या उलझन में डालने वाले अन्य मुद्दों से निपटने के लिए छाया-चित्र में, और हम पूंछ की हरकत को देख सकते थे और पूंछ को अधिक बाएं या side could have rendered. "
When the animals right on his tail in a deadpan dog (dog terms) seen shaking so they are completely comfortable.
But when he changed direction, mainly on the left side of the tail (re dog terms) rotating saw his heart beating fast and he looked nervous.
PRO. Vellrtigra not think the dog through these actions were intentionally communicate with each other.
Instead, they think dogs have learned from experience that it should be concerned on how they act and what not.
उन्होंने कहा: "यदि आप दूसरे कुत्तों से कई बार मिल चुके हैं, और यदि वे अपनी पूंछ को लगातार ही एक तरफ हिलाते हैं तो यह अधिक दोस्ताना व्यवहार से संबंधित है, और दायाँ भाग कम दोस्ताना व्यवहार प्रस्तुत करता है, आप उसी अनुभव के based on that feedback. "
Researchers say these findings owners, veterinarians and trainers can provide better information about the feelings of animals.
यूनिवर्सिटी ऑफ ब्रिस्टल के स्कूल ऑफ वेटरनेरी साइंसेज़ के अतिथि फ़ेलो, कुत्तों के व्यवहार के विशेषज्ञ जॉन ब्रेडशॉ ने बताया कि इसकी जाँच करने के लिए यह पहला अध्ययन नहीं है कि कुत्तों के लिए बायाँ या दायाँ भाग महत्वपूर्ण है या नहीं।
पिछले वर्ष यूनिवर्सिटी ऑफ लिंकन की टीम ने पाया कि जब कुत्ते किसी आक्रामक कुत्ते को देखते हैं तो अपना सिर बाईं ओर घुमाते हैं और खुश कुत्ते को देखने पर अपना सिर दाईं ओर घुमाते हैं।
Other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to the Italian study - the robot dog's tail wags the right side than the left side, then instead of being restless dogs were more likely to get near him."
He said the difference was because the animals or robots in various studies in dogs movies dogs were completely understand dogs.
He explained how the dog reacts to the study of real dogs can help.
"जबकि विभिन्न स्तनधारियों से इस बात के काफी सबूत मिले हैं कि मस्तिष्क के दो भागों का अलग-अलग उद्देश्यों के लिए उपयोग किया जाता है, अधिक विस्तृत जानकारी प्राप्त होना अभी भी बाकी है - और इस मामले में कुत्ते अपवाद नहीं हैं," उन्होंने said.
हालांकि, जिस आसानी से उनके व्यवहार को दर्ज किया जा सकता है, उसे देखते हुए लगता है कि हमें यह समझने में संभवतः अधिक समय नहीं लगेगा कि उनकी दुम कभी एक तरफ तो कभी दूसरी तरफ क्यों हिलती है।
New research has revealed that in the morning we work with honesty and dedication.
Do not lie or cheat and steal from someone you do not have to mind.
But the evening turns our minds and we seem to run against the norm of law is put aside.
Harvard University School of Business and Uto David Acls researchers in this research are many interesting facts.
Researchers said the stress of the work day was not much we prefer moral values​​, but honestly the evening because of fatigue or pressure decreases.
Researchers used for two.
Some people, he asked for the number of dots on a computer screen.
For instance, the point was to tell people is on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they give the wrong answer rather than the correct answer them money to be offered.
इस एक्सपेरिमेंट में देखा गया कि सुबह 8 से 12 के बीच जिन लोगों पर प्रयोग किया गया उन्होंने कोई गलती नहीं की और सही जवाब दिया।
People between 6 pm to 12 pm on the experiment found that while putting aside his principles intentionally answered incorrectly.
इससे रिसर्चर्स यह साबित करने में कामयाब हो गए कि सुबह पैसों के लालच से हमारी ईमानदारी पर कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता, लेकिन शाम होते ही हम नैतिकता को तवज्जो देना बंद कर देते हैं।
The research is published in the current issue of Psychological Science.

Obama voters scream of despair
I was expecting changes Obama voted twice
He said the GOP Obama obstructionism of the great efforts have been hampered
Obamakeyr website obstructionism problems, may not have the excuse of drone attacks
Memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign reminds me of those things that could have been
Natheniyl P. Morris, a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
Nowadays I am very sad to read books.
This is a book, which I think it will encourage me during the second year of medical school nostalgia and hope in my Jagayegi.
The name "Dare to Win" and the 2008 presidential election campaign of Barack Obama is Snsmrika.
जब मैं रात में अपने रोगियों के पर्चों से फुरसता पाता हूँ तथा बिस्तर पर जाता हूँ तो यह किताब मुझे एक ऐसे दौर में ले जाती है, जिसमें राजनीति ने लाखों लोगों को प्रेरित किया था तथा भाषण आपकी सांस को रोककर रख सकते थे।
The choice proved aside, and news of the speakers then took pause to reflect historical significance.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents took to save each receive newsletter.
The White House was a team of young visionary individuals, and the nation was ready for a change.
During Obama became president in 2008, he had a 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The present reality is a harsh truth, as come back from the dream world.
Hope is hard to miss those days - they seem a distant memory, a tragic reminder of lost opportunities.
After I did the first time voting actually changed.
To put it in simple as could not imagine any of this.
I'll give Obama credit for many achievements, the Affordable Care Act, our troop withdrawal from Iraq, "Do not Ask, Do not Tell" from the end to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
इसके अलावा मैं विश्वास करता हूँ कि पक्षपाती विरोध करने की नीति ने हमारे देश के आगे बढ़ने के बहुत से प्रयासों को रोका हैः जिसमें अप्रवासी सुधार, स्वास्थ्य सेवा के लिए सार्वजनिक विकल्प, ग्वांतानामो बे पर अड्डा बंद करना, के अलावा और अन्य शामिल हैं।
But numberless times in which I find myself in front of colleagues and peers in favor of the Obama administration - Taking over me the answer which I can give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican leaders of the protest spying foreign policy is not the answer, nor is the answer to the drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
यह राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा एजेन्सी द्वारा आम अमेरिकी नागरिकों की निजी जीवन के बारे में डेटा संग्रहित करने का जवाब नहीं दे सकती है न ही सरकार की गलत हरकतों का उजागर करने वाले लोगों पर अभियोग चलाने का उत्तर दे सकती है।
यह बिना किसी ट्रायल के अमेरिकी नागरिक अनवर एल अवलाकी की हत्या का कारण नहीं बता सकती है, न ही राष्ट्रपति कैम्पेन के दौरान कम होते सार्वजनिक निधि तथा व्यय सीमाओं का ही।
यह उस रिपोर्ट के निष्कर्षों का उत्तर नहीं दे सकती है, जिसका कहना है कि व्हाइट हाउस द्वारा मीडियो को चुप कराने के प्रयास "निक्सन प्रशासन के बाद से अब तक सबसे आक्रामक रहे हैं।"
And most recently, the Affordable Care Act, signed into law three years after the failure of designing a simple website can not excuse.
I do not know what I had expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I must assume that the system of governance, political campaigns deny that it may bring forth.
There is a predictable way that is directly elected office, political party and random events occur, such as anti carnage of Newtown, we will provide the public discussion.
The examples I have given above, however, they appear to be mostly chosen by the administration itself.
It bothers you most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthralled by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain option, which is not like his policies or seemed to determine their position.
I felt a second term for Obama, who would be free from the pressure of future elections, will meet those expectations about which we have heard for a long time.
However, while Obama's Anumeadn rating is less than 45 percent this week, through that book back in 2008, has become very difficult.
I saw him miss his promises to have disappeared.
This week I was reading a part of the book, which was described how the Pennsylvania primary, Obama was due Nhua big loss to Clinton.
A post - mortem campaign meeting he told his subordinate employees are required to return them back on track, and is required to be honest on your objectives.
"I want to get my mojo back."
We must remember who we are. "
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I could not agree with you more.

Premature puberty: Growing up
Research shows that African - American and Hispanic girls younger than her age, blonde girls attain puberty.
The physical changes of puberty does not mean that it is nigh
There is no evidence that this hormone or any other chemicals may be to blame
Experts believe that obesity outbreak, the age of puberty may cause
Case of premature puberty in boys is not as effective
CNN Pat Ithrij the former BBC journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
What mother would be worried if her daughter at the age of 7 or 8 of the breasts and genital hair growth to get started?
This week, Orlando, Florida at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitj clarified that the initial physical changes are common in American women, they represent a new trend.
Kaplovitj says, "I - I spent a bit of time to assure parents - that rapid progress towards full bloom usually not reflect it."
The development of direct signs sprout breasts, genitalia and bodily odor hircus looking girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades menarche (first monthly - religion) changes in age is very slight.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"If you start developing breast menophania takes at least two to three years," explains Kaplovitj the "time in girls - pre puberty: the essential guide for dealing with this common problem." The author
Puberty is a time of developing the most accurate test.
What is the beginning of puberty, there is debate about this, but with the growth of breast development before the age of 8 are two of the "child - adult," he says.
In most cases, this process will stop or slow down - the hair doctor can inspect it closely.
In case of more rapid progress एन्डोक्राइनोलॉजिस्ट examined by tumors or cysts as may be required in order to remove the potential for serious problems.
Time - prior month - religion and other consequences of delaying treatment: the bones of the time - before age - growth, resulting in stunted growth and as adults may be undersized.
Drug or hormone treatment recommendations for the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and depend on the emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplovithj aware of drugs, but admits, "suppressing puberty can increase behavioral issues, and girls may seem to feel different from their peers."
The other major problem is clear: parents just do not want their youngest daughter Monthly - religion.
Kaplovithj said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or that they will maintain the hygiene."
A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at 10 years Umre, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this thing and we have monthly - talk about religion, but he was not emotionally ready.
He returned from school frightened and upset that my friends began her first menstruation.
Many theories about the causes of precocious puberty are Suprclit.
However, this is not a sustainable evidence that milk or other food - the hormone substances, chemicals in the environment or can be charged to messages in the media Yunonmuki.
Boys - like girls - time - are pre-puberty.
The rules define Kaplovithj it is the main reason for the outbreak of obesity.
उन्होंने वर्ष 2001 में 6 से 9 वर्ष की लड़कियों के ऊपर अध्ययन संचालित करने में सहायता की थी, जो शरीर के वसा को यौवन के समय के साथ जोड़ती है।
Other results support this conclusion, but many other factors are also contributing.
In this country, African - American and Hispanic girls my age tend to get blonde girls before puberty.
Several - the explanations.
At the global level, under-time counterpart of youth, ranging from economic conditions, weather and jeans, all things appear to be affected.
Another puzzle: the boy's face and genitalia are the youngest child, but not entirely clear as puberty, girls have practiced them.
A.a.pil Jtiltaoen of other physicians who will be attending the conference theme supported.
Even in infants and children has become common to see acne and genital hair.
Moristaun, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital in New Jersey Goryeb एन्डोक्राइनोलॉजिस्ट, Dr. Lawrence Silverman says, "We need to be very cautious about how we identify the actual start of puberty."
अभिभावकों को इस बारे में राय लेने के लिए अपने बाल चिकित्सक से मार्गदर्शन लेने में संकोच नहीं करना चाहिए कि अपने बच्चों से कैसे बात करें।
Kaplovitj advised, "This may be the time required to negotiate before."
If you remain calm, your child will usually answered properly.
समय से पूर्व विकास करने वाली लड़कियों का यह भरोसा दिलाए जाने की आवश्यकता होती है कि भले ही यह समय से पूर्व हो रहा हो लेकिन यह सामान्य जीवन का हिस्सा है।

Mr Ditta misused his office as a criminal lawyer to join its distinguished clients with very high charges.
हम सामान्य नशीली दवा डीलर के सम्बन्ध के बारे में नहीं, बल्कि ऐसे डीलर के बारे में बात नहीं कर रहे हैं जो अपने वकील को नशीली दवा प्रदान कर रहा है।

Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity, trust and confidence of the people must fill.
Mr Ditta has betrayed the trust and have tried to escape under the cover of his profession.

The purpose of the new law, the parents of the newborn babies to reduce pressure on the penis - Specifications surgery can take hasty decisions about, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
BBC Years later, according to an intersex person said, "Neither I am male, nor female."
I wound made ​​by physicians, will remain tainted patch.
Estimated 2,000 children each year in which a child is that neither boy nor girl.
वे इंटरसेक्स हैं, लगभग 60 स्थितियों के समूह का हिस्सा, जो लैंगिक विकास के विकारों की जांच के अन्तर्गत आता है, यह सामूहिक शब्द है जिसे असामान्य गुणसूत्र, जननग्रंथि (अंडाशय या वृषण), अथवा असामान्य रूप से विकसित लिंग के लिए उपयोग किया जाता 's.
Maybe they're intersex Wallis Simpson.
लिंग पहचान को अभी भी ठीक से नहीं समझा जाता, लेकिन युनाइटेड स्टेट्स में अधिकांश विशेषज्ञों का मानना है कि जब लिंग-निर्धारण नहीं हो सकता है तो लिंग निर्दिष्ट करने के लिए मौजूद सर्वोत्तम सूचना का उपयोग करना बेहतर है तथा शल्य-चिकित्सा कराने, यदि come such an eventuality,
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dreshr gender - identity specialist, he said that Germany's new law "appears to be a good thing."
Intersex children create moral quandary.
He said, "Some people die - are in a crisis situation for which surgery is required, but most kids would not do that."
You surgery without having to specify gender, identity and, after that, see how that develops.
How a child will grow a penis, but knowing it is not very precise science.
No one can answer about why this is appropriate.
It's like a puzzle why people are gay.
वर्ष 2011 में यूरोपियन कमीशन के समक्ष दाखिल की गई रिपोर्ट में इंटरसेक्स लोगों को ट्रांससेक्सुअल अथवा ट्रांसजेन्डर लोगों से भिन्न रूप में वर्णित किया गया है, क्योंकि उनकी स्थिति लिंग से सम्बन्धित नहीं होती है बल्कि उसके जैविक रचना से सम्बन्धित होती है, जो न

Now non - compliant sex are special camps for boys.
Australia and Nepal adults on their official documents, male, female or "third gender" has already marked permission.
In June, 52-year-old Australian in Nori - Velbi life - until "unspecified" sex appeal to win legal status after having been the first in the world recognized "sexless" became man.
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport in addition to the M or F x as third Specifications for intersex individuals will too.
France 24, according to news reports, the neighboring country of France gender issues are still debated.
In 2011, this strongly Catholic country, dozens of French law - makers of school books "gender theory" have signed a petition for withdrawal.
U.S.की वेबसाइट कैथोलिक ऑनलाइन ने भी जर्मनी के इस कानून का यह कहते हुए विरोध किया है, "जबकि दुनिया ऐसी अवस्था में जा रही है, जहां पर लिंग स्वयं चुने जाने वाले विकल्प है, लेकिन यौन क्रियाकलाप नहीं, हम सभ्यता के दो और स्तंभों को are moving in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of newborn babies Baby John said that he would like to see be assigned gender at birth.
He said about raising website, "without raising additional limitations is very stressful, especially if you also do not know what the sex of your child."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, born with both male and female genitalia Hrmafrodaits kids (unisex) was called, which was named after the Greek god who all were heterosexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world was regarded as the penis slate that can be erased and rewritten.
But now many people surgery is challenging the ethics, they understand that gender identity - is complicated, and occasionally may be mistaken by physicians who do not know that kids grow up Specifications will feel about your penis.
Dreshr says, "In the mid-twentieth century, the" psychiatric emergency "call.
When these children were born, then you would not have called the psychiatrist, you surgeon was called up.
Treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia existing theory about John Hapakins University was presented by Dr. John Money, who were considered sex Sunirmanniy.
उन्होंने "लिंग पहचान" शब्द की रचना की तथा तर्क दिया कि सामाजिक और पर्यावरणीय संकेत - माता-पिता बच्चे की परवरिश कैसे करते हैं - बच्चे के जीन और हॉरमोन्स के साथ अंतःक्रिया करके निर्धारित करते हैं कि उसे पुरुष के रूप में पहचाना जाए या महिला aS.
But in the case of 1966, the "John / Joan" known as, his theory became controversial.
They have one child, whose gender circumcision (Srkmsisn) was unknown during the accident, the parents advised his testicles removed by infertile if they are full of children and their upbringing to girl.
Dreshr said, "Money in a case presented as a successful case of transition, but he did not."
At the age of 15, took the child and his back turned as the man got married to a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Dreshr said some doctors still "followed the same pattern are".
But in the years after 1990 with the advent of the Internet, these penis surgery undergone by men started to come out "not happy with the results."
The 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce Montana case was with the x. Y. Was born with male chromosomes, but it was ambiguous genitalia.
चिकित्सकों को स्पष्ट रूप से समझ में नहीं आया कि उसका लिंग छोटा था, या उसका भगशेफ बड़ा था, लेकिन वे निश्चित थे कि वह कभी भी पुरुष के रूप में "संतुष्ट जीवन" नहीं जी सकता।
Therefore, some time after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testicles surgery and removed the girl was his upbringing.
Female hormone given to him at the age of 12.
He told ABCNews.com, "I'm not the girl I knew."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, was supposed to Vajainoplasti with him.
But depressed and feel something wrong, she sought medical records.
The frightening truth is revealed.
I was born infertile - and never told anyone.
Bruce Di.asldil Was born with, which prevented his body from making adequate amounts of testosterone, which caused her genitalia did not develop a proper manner.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took testosterone supplements and pulled her breasts.
Surgery because she was barren.
Today, the interface project intersex individuals in the organization to explain to people about their perception is normal.
However, California - based legal group Advocates for Annie Tamr Informd Executive Director of Choice - Matisse express concern that Germany's law "invites the label and stigma."
She says, "Many people think that Germany's law activist parents and child to make quick decisions" undefined "specified will cause."
We fear that it will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, better process to specify male or female gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamr - Matisse said his organization supports the Australian legislation does so because "it allows adults to be recognized in the third sex."
"The legal adults about sex should be able to make their own decisions."
Germany's law to specify that it relates to the time of birth.
At this time it is not a war fought by young children.
Grow older, your body can take decisions about themselves.
But Pittsburgh breast radiologist Dr. Erlyne Baratj whose daughter's sexual development disorder, and have helped hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law parents and children both "will provide the power."
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but the absolute insensitivity syndrome called androgens Di.asldil Was.
Since the defect in the receptor androgens, therefore, developed in Katy female characteristics.
In the vagina, uterus or ovary, but her body is not so.
Now the 29-year-old Katy is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pensilvania.
Although she is infertile, but that becoming a mother through adoption or Gesteshnl Surrogacy is expected.
Baratj said, "This legislation parent lets the fact that you can not take any decision in haste."
Them, 'male' or 'female' writing and understanding a reasonable time before trial offers.
This way, you are right - to nurture the child, the child's love.
Enjoy and have a cute baby.
We hurried such surgery do not have to make that can not be returned.
He said, "This decision-making process brings children and parents to motivate free from anxiety because they do not believe that they are right."
Eventually, the child will determine how he is more comfortable with sex - and it would be good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

George Kerevnः euro disruption given the option to Scots
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that the EUकी सदस्यता की शर्त के रूप में पूरे यूरोप में स्वतंत्र यात्रा क्षेत्र के रूप में शामिल होने के लिए स्वतंत्र स्कॉटलैंड की आवश्यकता होगी।
Berwick passport control at the border of barbed wire on the walls of Hadrian indicate about the stories.
Strathclyde is true that the free movement of paper with the rest of Europe about the potential economic benefits described, though - as anticipated - Headlines not explain it.
No one describes the EU Members of your time and spend your formal rules change to suit your needs.
Scotland Since the Schengen area, so Brussels from Scotland who really wants to get him in exchange for continuous non - compliance affordable to Brussels would be exempt.
So, again, non-story.
Another thing which has stuck for so long, he has been frozen. I first "Freedom means passport control" baseless news was heard about 40 years ago.
However, the interesting point of this interesting old story telling lost again.
Independent Scotland expect to Europe anyway, why should the bidding?
London to Brussels yoke why merchandising should be, especially now?
Great news: the Europe to organize a genuine European war - after the plan has finally been halted.
With the euro crisis, Europe project is officially dead.
The EU In the EU Or opposed to common euro currency are firmly dedicated crew to stop.
Even in Germany for Germany Uroskeptil Alternative Party - has established itself this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election of September came and received, and thus the Free Democrats (Lib Dems have our own equivalent) effective in
Plans to build a federal Europe has always been the domestic opposition.
However, the current economic crisis proved a radical conversion.
बर्लिन और यूरोपियन सेन्ट्रल बैंक द्वारा लगाए गए कठोर नियमों के साथ ही, समान मुद्रा का अनुपालन करने के माध्यम से राष्ट्रीय अर्थव्यवस्थाओं पर लगाई गई बाधाओं के कारण बहुत लोगों को सोचना पड़ रहा है कि प्रोजेक्ट यूरोप बहुत दूर चला गया है।
National governments excessive budget deficit was not a great role in the euro crisis - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system to its members in favor of the German exporters have stable exchange rate - something that would keep German politician.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, in southern Europe than in Germany itself finds it in a state of productivity inherent disadvantage.
The only way to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems have deep European productivity morbidity.
उपभोक्ताओं के व्यय पर फ्रांसीसी और जर्मन ऊर्जा फर्मों को छूट प्रदान करने के लिए - ब्रसेल्स द्वारा लगाई गई "हरित" ऊर्जा नीतियों के परिणामस्वरूप, यूरोपियन उद्योग संयुक्त राष्ट्र की तुलना में बिजली के लिए दोगुना तथा गैस के लिए चार गुना भुगतान करते हैं।

There is a sense of rebellion erupted between people, especially in France, once the EU Was a major fan.
Uddh EU after France's top politicians Control of Germany, and Paris Wanshigtn equal billing in the world was seen as a way to provide.
But Berlin and Paris as political validity of the passport is not required, and also their own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy is shaky.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU Anti-Socialist ruling National Front in the recent by-election push has conquered the third place.
इस समय फ्रांस में फ्रंट 24 प्रतिशत वोट के साथ सबसे लोकप्रिय दल है - यह ब्रिटिश लेबर के लिए यथासमय चेतावनी है कि वे यह मानकर नहीं चल सकते हैं कि बाएं के लिए विघटन, दाएं के लिए स्वतः ही लाभ हेागा।
Le Pen French whites, the working class is doing with his new found fame?
The team next year EU Using the European Parliament elections in the EU Anti, anti faction wants to make the common currency.
If, as is quite possible, these elections EU If the opposing team do well the first time such a group could affect the European Parliament.
My approach is this: In Europe the EU soon Euro common currency and combines anti-anti-Semitism will end.
The euro will not disappear entirely, but the retailer "(sovereign) nations of Europe" will return to some form of support to the General De Gaulle.
Germany and the euro economies can maintain a retainer, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK.'s Expected to increase with proximity to the UK Keep yourself away from this project.
However, Wanshigtn growing interest in Pacific indicates that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.
After all, what about Scotland?
Little England area we (necessarily) may choose to remain.
Or can we protect our own economic interests - including Berlin and Brussels is the perfect time to tell you to be different.
I think the European system work better Scotland loose - to be performed, provided that we keep our own currency.
Non - Federal States of Europe to work together with other like-minded countries would be easy.
Otherwise we walk on the path of Norway to maintain its economic independence should consider about.
In Scotland S.anlpil Government - the Ulleknniy - the most successful economies in Europe - is anti-political campaign, the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling proposed (and implemented) to resist cuts and post-Tory - Lib Dem coalition
This time to vote for independence for Scotland would be absurd, because in that case the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels must accept the Terms.
