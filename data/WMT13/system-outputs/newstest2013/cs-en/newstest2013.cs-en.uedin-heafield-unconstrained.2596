The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policy of necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan's Centre, however, indicates that fraud as a myth that election fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning struck.
Republican lawyers, in the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in the US, Canada has the responsibility for the organisation of federal elections of individual states.
And in this spirit, the majority of American governments since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult to process the election or registration on the electoral roll.
This phenomenon has the expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 of restrictive electoral law in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for the elections in advance, override the right to register on the list of voters on election day and odnímají electoral law the registration of citizens with criminal records.
Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to present photo identification with půkazu no American state.
The first state that this requirement, it was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.
Republican officials hurried to the enlargement of the procedure, as well as in other states.
In the last two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states, with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that, unlike the Quebec are not American citizens universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, owns 11% of American citizens, that at the age of 21 million people to vote, no identity card with a photograph issued by a government authority of their country.
It does not have an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years old, therefore, does not have the required identity card with a photograph.
And that's not all.
The students, who are known for their voters to shift to Democratic candidates in several states are not entitled to use their identity card with a photograph issued by his school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates, the cards issued by these clubs to use in the elections.
In 2004, the state did not require any proof of citizenship before the election.
The first such a requirement in Arizona.
From 2011, about a dozen states have laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
Obviously, these measures are aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011 to support laws in eight states, with the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters for registration of approximately 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after 2009 but has caused a decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state was only 13%.
For Hispanics, it was the same.
They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of people voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, there were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly built Democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors veto blocked several bills.
In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.
Some of them have managed to limit the damage.
For example, the laws requiring the submission of the identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.
The newly introduced rules, however, is undeniably impedes the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics are talking mainly about bias approved laws and consider them to be an obvious attempt to influence the results of the election in 2012 in key states.
Brennan's Centre in 2011, the report shows that the states where such laws were approved, represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already: The new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: Complete examination or not?
PSA test was sometimes incorrect results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.
All of this has increased the reluctance of the men, who are already reluctant to go to the test at all.
To investigate or not?
We asked two experts on the view.
In studies conducted in the US has shown a high level of contamination among the test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, said the different mortality rates among patients who have undergone tests, and those who did not go to them.
The study also showed the 12letém distance that those who do not go to the test, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men are also more at risk of African-American origin.
The key is to take the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive forms of cancer, and such species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to explain to the patient's level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him a possible alternatives, necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which is in the long-term impact on life, and in these cases focus more on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men who had been diagnosed with cancer cure, as their type of cancer is aggressive and threatens them for life.
Rather, they propose the implementation of active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater precision establishing criteria, which will help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not.
Therefore, I recommend the tests.
But it is important to have an interview with the doctor and determine whether or not it is appropriate to take the tests.
Companies in cooperation with the International urologickou Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with PSA testing.

The prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risk of disease of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving enough, you could prevent up to 30% of the cases of cancer.
"If they stop smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by heredity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society remains a priority in the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several others.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," spokesman Andre Beaulieu, shaking his head.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of death from cancer by half.
The mass of
The SCC stoutness and obesity are another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon," says the report.
Nutrition for the
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
The too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is best to avoid the sausages, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat, smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"May cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," says the report.
The vitamins
In recent times, various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými supplements and cancer.
Research, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are the SCC contradictory.
Although, according to one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, other studies suggest the increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.
"To submit to testing does not mean that you have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosonu likely caused a stir last summer.
There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
And then there is the last particle whose existence was predicted the standard model - our best, or "least bad" explanations of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicists, however, so far there is no 100 percent certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle, which is very similar to this Higgs bosonu, as predicted in the standard model.
New data released this week during a physical congress in Kyoto to confirm the absence of any data yet, so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it is the Higgs boson, because of the risk of error appears to be small, and look at what's happening.
In this world there is a definite law, according to which the two things cannot be at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be ignored - and don't try too hard, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.
Although it is a very strange world of particle physics, it turns out that there is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
Particle physicists further divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony, obediently comply with Pauli principles.
And at the other end of the range bosony, anarchists, who weighs nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they may still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: Mesony here we go unnoticed, and "force particles," which is the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
However, to say that these bosony are not as exotic pets, how could be considered.
If you read this article, it is thanks to bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or "particle of light," which is "a" electromagnetic force.
When particles with electric charge to accelerate or change their direction, "disturbed" by the electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.
From this "distraction" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than the photon - and thus one of bosonů, "of the force."
More stable field
But it's also the Higgs bosonem, except that "interrupt" should be another field, Higgsovo field that this boson.
This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the excitation should be to achieve very high energy values, such as the frozen surface of a pond, which moves a lot of a large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator CERN accelerator in the laboratory as part of the Large Hadron Collider - the friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop that kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field, throw us again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Do not react with the electromagnetic field, all the particles and all materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be itself to stick on the fridge.
And it is true that the Higgs field do not respond with all the particles: Those that do have some mass, while others (such as the photon, look at him) don't have it.
And Mrs Smith asks what all of these studies are what "us"?
From the point of view of science is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any discrepancy between observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, many physicists have literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and close some of the gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model is still huge shortcomings, no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the matter (oops!).
So far, however, the CERN facilities such contradictions there.
Response of
The response of these research in everyday life Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Behold: At the beginning of the 1960s pioneers laser at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution, will have their work.
Assumed the scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous light pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "toy in the lab."
Just imagine...
And besides, it can also result from the application of all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at the optics.
This scanner, though it Boyle first as planned, now serves as the "eye" of the digital cameras in the world and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activity around the LHC is bound to change your life, but it does mean that you really never know.
Palliative care - the best way to go through life... | Le devoir
Through its Commission for dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in a delicate questions regarding the end of life.
The debate should continue, and at the same time, the bill.
In this crucial area, there is still a lot of work to do.
The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a couple of weeks ago Mr L. still alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which was consuming him, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: The extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the toilet or feed himself.
Resignation is looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.
It's a bold and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop for him, bringing him drugs, offer a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, he humiliated me," she says.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his problem.
"In all my life and learn that the guys in the urine," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage of the child is for some people an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on a person's abilities," whether to accept the return, says psychologist.
According to a number of people involved in palliative care, the crucial moments are taking place in the heart of such a return.
Patients who are at home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
The forecast is for a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, they are a team of doctors and nurses who care for them, provide so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs A, 89 years old, is the worst fear to die of suffocation fully conscious. "
But the disease has allowed me to discover their children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I have no desire in my life," he says, and then allow us to put on her breathing apparatus.
He enjoys in the coming days on the last visit to a son from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body with the help of nutrition.
It looks like palliative care, which is, if you cannot do anything else.
The death was more comfortable.
In Québeku seems one bed palliative care to 11 700 inhabitants.
This is very little, if we realise that we all have to die.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a man dies, for example, you can give him a sip of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics will no longer need to watch the level of sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night, carrying beer, Mr X, who later died in the night.
His son this morning, drinks a beer in honor of the late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days one after the other, but like each other.
In addition to the year old man, who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while his whole in his honor, dying tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children, after having tried all options in order to survive.
"For half a year, there is always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years," says Dr Christiane Martelová with concern.
53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% of hospitals.
The problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, or to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of the sick, in the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in a hospital or in a halfway house.
And a few organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and Company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively on the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec leads to a number of doctors specialising in palliative care is the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is already in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, evidenced by his opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martelové Quebec health-care system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to high-quality palliative care before it can agree with the euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the ER in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.
He fears that patients ask about the killing on the grounds that they do not receive appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative prognosis.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce that I quit with the treatment, said she regrets that I fight, tells us.
And he told me that it's over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to his treating doctors to fill their wish when their team palliative pussy ease the pain.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care at the Society for home palliative care the Grand Montréal, the treatment of pain in patients from 8% of the cases.
At the very end of his life, often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whatever fits and starts, or whether they are the sedative administered permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not see this part of the suffering.
The patient, who escape the pain, will have a greater ability to access paliativním sedation.
Patients who are not given a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me the euthanasia," it means, "I want to get rid of the pain."

Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Administration officials, entrepreneurs in the construction and public works, lobbyists political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell what they know about a "system" in which the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and organized crime.
This "field" came in Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system crumbled since we have taken strong measures," says ironically, Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him, a scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of rigorous investigation for embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the former liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.
"Duchesneauova report" confirmed a direct link between the industry, the murky financing of parties and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "but the Ministry of Transport to save a billion dollars in contracts," as some people keep in check their instincts to get their share.
Charbonneauova Commission "has already led to the resignation of two of the mayor," he adds with the hope that she could "to uncover the subtlety of some of the people."
The permanent unit for combating corruption, based in 2011
The Anti-Corruption Unit based in 2011 is also involved in a fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
The police officers' Marteauovy company "from 2009 to ensure that the cartel" montrealský penězovodů "significantly reduced inflation contracts.
In recent weeks, carried out a series of searches and accused of fraud and corruption of local councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a municipality from the suburbs.
Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly took bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lina Zambito caused a sensation when the commission said the "system" of public procurement.
During these years he spent 3% of the value of the contracts which v Montréalu, middle-man associated with the Mafia, which then transfer the money to the Union Montréal, for which he was running for Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
After the year 2000 Zambito was generous to all the parties and gave more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) a provincial parties, but especially the Liberals, who were then in power.
He also confessed to organizing the illegal source of funds for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
The contract with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: During the 10 years he received from construction companies gifts, invited on trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and spending money in the value of a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody which nadsazoval price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they pay fees for about 30% to 40% by means of false invoices víceprací.
The organizer of the mayor's Martin Dumont then Tremblaye accused of slitting his eyes without embarrassment over the parallel budget that the Treasury was dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which put Montreal in large-scale crises.
Chantal Rouleau montrealskými was among the first members who issued a warning signal.
As Mayor of the Rivière-des-prairies to the east of the island is already from 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotérům directly in the middle of the prosperous trade in real estate.
The 70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will be finally opened, says that "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits."
According to her, "the process is painful, but a positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is necessary to establish a v Montréalu own investigative unit, and to ensure that these dubious practices could not return.
As cleaning.
A regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned, in particular the role of "well-informed about this ruse" if those dealing in them!
It is estimated that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with irony, he adds: "I have heard that this is a weak brew of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it will not solve the situation according to him: "As long as strictly restrict campaign spending, dirty money out of politics."
It proposes a comprehensive monitoring system of public procurement and the financing of parties, "which we cannot fall; if we focus on the nature of things, we can build on more solid foundations, and with greater control and compliance with the law."
If this story defamed the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all those who scoff at him to look at their own backyard.
"PSG is FC Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG put a completely new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into himself, or an entirely new dimension of PSG.
They came to us the big players.
Every day I get next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
The games and it's easier.
In football, it is all very fast.
But I don't lose my head.
Since my beginnings in prep school in the INF Clairefontaine after a stopover in Saint-Etienne, I have always pushed for each grade.
Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which led Carlo Ancelotti.
Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me, then more flavor to the game and wants to make maximum power.
And it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti, in connection with my position.
In the hands of the assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the final word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
Today has no equal in the first league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has vast experience and with top teams won a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
I will win in Paris the other titles.
In January, I had a conversation with him.
I've had a number of injuries.
Trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
How you look at the first part of the season, PSG?
In the first league us Lyon picked up the position.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We are very easily to osmifinále.
What is the purpose of your club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a match for high-quality European teams.
First of all, we want to win their qualifying group ahead of Porto, in order to play in retaliation osmifinále at home.
PSG may be in the short term, a major European club?
It is the budget.
The Paris to become a major European club, must win titles and go down in history.
Today, it is not yet.
On the financial side of the PSG means that this plan could take place.
And it would be a big setback nezvítězit in 1 league as last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, we want to win the league title a lot.
In the last season, we still missing.
In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a master.
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think that this year it will.
Even though the title and the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what was invested and what we have the players.
Absolutely we accept.
It is a fact that when home beat Troyes 4-0 and still find something in the newspaper about us, so it's not very pleasant.
One wonders what they want from you people more.
It is not, of course, to win 4-0 on each weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game style.
You need to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season osmifinále, and also have invested large sums of money.
Given the invested sums you would expect that you will be in front of the other 15 points ahead.
You insult the other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in last year's season, too, with the new PSG moved into the next phase.
This shows how 1 League is amazing.
I hope that we will be able to smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as if PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that they say that there is a "dependence on Zlatanovi."
This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful, and that gives a lot of goals.
To come here and shows that it is the star 1 league.
Wherever he has shown that he is a great player, a world star.
In our team we respect the man and the players.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is really exceptional.
This has led others to increase their level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the other side-by-side growth.
How are you going through Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As disappointment.
I wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, I couldn't play because of the injury, as I had imagined.
But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.
Today, I'm able to play good games and entertainment.
And that is what I had hoped for since her team.
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today, we owe it to ourselves, to our presence was exemplary.
As you look at the first of the month, Didier Deschampse at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In the qualification for MS we are in a good place.
The coach selects the top, it is the players around and able to win.
That was the Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved its goal that we qualified for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
It's a draw (1: 1) of 16 October in Spain, a solid baseline game?
This game gave us added confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before the shock in Spain, I experienced such a game in his career.
Thanks to Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on the central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing among the beneficiaries.
In the context of these technologies, as is often true, there is a clear political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is how virtual money (transferable, however, the dollar, the euro...) and secure transfer protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.
About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoinu rate peaked at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today it is on the border of about 10 dollars (an overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products it is not impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on the virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "equal to the current money."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money, such as "credits" used for the procedure in the video game, which one will win the game, or you can buy (and sometimes even back to change).
The social networking site Facebook also developed a similar system.
Each month, but the central authority controls and processes of individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all the nodes of the network to the depositary of current accounts, the controllers, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How the network works?
Every transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses via e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
File of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key lies in the writing of this new phase of the transaction in this book.
There is a means of solving the mathematical task of the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the stage of cutting up the file; that is, the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital fingerprint.
The computer "take over" this new transaction and added to her number, then the whole "chop."
The aim is to find a number that provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructible displays connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would be to change the print.
If the user wanted for the fraud to pay twice for the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network is only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer that will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.
To avoid inflation, are divided into two of the reward on a regular basis, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, but can be divided up to part in nine hundred million, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the task is also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and there has been an estrangement between imposed bitcoinů.
"The flaw is not in itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, company for the payment of real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also true for cash.
The major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, is adopted.
ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current accounts and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů circulation.
In November, the "huge discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for bitcoinů Coinabul dealing with the transformation of the gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books for the money, he has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but uses a system for verifying the Bitcoin transactions, which are cheaper because of it.
In addition, a managing their identity and so can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set in the traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
We need to address, which can be a telephone "photograph it and recognize it," explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," predicts.
In its report, the ECB is expected to review the various risks that are now considered to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.
We left from Afghanistan.
And what next?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and American forces should be followed by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan Army took control of its territory and that the Afghans have chosen their own future and waiting for all of us.
The greatest damage suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished, as we consider them terrorists.
And so do we, but we lost 88 of the slain soldiers, and all those injured and maimed.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often it is the peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic tradition, even joined the jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekové, Tajiks.
Are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance of local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw their support for the fall.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab, which I watched from the mountaintops posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, orderly.
A convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul with no escort helicopters for aerial attack.
By the end of 2014 talibánci already in Kabul will not be so active.
From their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
Their taking control of the country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price for the ignorance of these villagers, which completely dominated by Al-K 'Ido, their situation has not improved, however, in our time.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci match in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The dignitaries from the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They were hustlers soldiers, grabbed public land sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and the use of the huge US contracts for subcontractors.
Discredit; most of them had never even been in a fight.
From what I heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will not be the thieves.
Many of the young people want to leave as they leave those who were able to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and the associated ideology.
During his exile in Iran or in Pakistan recognized the modern world and its benefits is taken.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; in Kabul is currently 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are full, there are girls and boys.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they don't want to go back to the obscurantism earlier parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones, TV and the Turkish series, which show the modern world, they are everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand up to her forehead, regarded as legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army already renewing provincial militias that are beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation should be along the lines of the Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that the abolition of the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai wants foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country is from the 1950s and earlier years heavily reliant on foreign aid.
No industry has failed to restore, no dam doesn't work, there is no major irrigation system repaired.
Everything is imported; it's not just fruit and vegetables.
Priority is a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would have been necessary government control of the infrastructure.
Rumors flew that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And it's just fueling the feeling that Western countries were only to be captured.
Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no minerals can take place.
The Chinese already almost left Mes Aynak copper mine and left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the possibility of a large Buddhist area, to preserve the role of the major employer in the province.
One day, it will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is a large part of imports and exports to resume normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new treaty on cooperation is the continuation of the normal types of assistance: Girls' and boys' lyce, professor of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, supporting archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 work initiative "to get the heart and soul of" trying to be a difficult task to reconcile the aid and military activities, which then was the "civil-military actions," the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but, thanks to the small French non-governmental organisation of a number of successes in the areas of common interest and steps for agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
The work, which involved a number of local workers, have helped to dampen the insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil conservation and expansion of cultivable land.
What kind of memory to leave after two billion military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2,000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
These farmers to be liberated from the uprising led by foreign groups, they want to make a civil assistance in their favour, which would have been properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursí went to another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the promulgation of the Constitution, which temporarily granted unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.
On Wednesday, he announced, without regard to the views of all the others, that the Constituent Assembly approved the final version.
Less than a week ago by the head of state of this the next two months to complete the work.
For nearly two years, Egypt is a text, which was often supplemented, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to legal controversies.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.
From the perspective of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "violates his word" and "tramples on the right."
His supporters, however, have been assured that it is a means to quickly deal with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
In two weeks, there should be a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the Egyptians to clarify the text article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country by the protests.
He confirmed in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or you have unlimited powers," which otherwise would have ended after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of a constitutional assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists.
Most of the Liberals in the vote was missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, bouchli doors that do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society, or members of religious minorities in their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning, quickly followed by 11 people from among the members.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution have often voted unanimously.
Commentators have also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the conference room are not properly adjusted.
The text, which was voted on last night, is composed of 234 articles.
The subject of widespread attention, Article 2, is consistent with the final version of the 1971 constitution and states that "the principles of sharia law is the main source of law."
The Salafi parties for the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term "principles" by the term "rules," which would allow stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," argue the liberals, who see it as just a problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
Focusing in particular on the article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, especially for control of the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "people are not competent to make choices and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this as the beginnings of theocracy. "
Liberals fear even more stirring up the fact that the next president of the University should be less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there was no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution remains in Egypt by the state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university researchers, many of them trained in French schools, "is tempered by concern Alexis Blouet, who prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.
They agree, however, that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because it used the terms belongs to a religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to the "fiqh" (Islamic jurisprudence, but doable).
And it may occur in the future, the question of to what extent they are civilian judges competent to be able to express. "
Yesterday approved the text is in addition to the religious aspects of very criticized because of the expanded powers, which gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in the former regime.
Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the leaders of the army will be verification of the defence budget to Parliament, but the National Council of Defense.
Then there will be prohibited in the military courts proceedings with civilians, as requested by the association for the protection of human rights.
This association is in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its misgivings.
The crime of blasphemy is retained and an insult to the disabled, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
No article is also involved in the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, it is the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was speaking last night in a television speech, rallies are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will manifest on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" in Moscow: Emigrants would save money on language
While members of parliament and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory language tests in the country have already discovered the fraudsters who sell "fake" certificates
In Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities in 13 million foreign workers each year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their sole purpose is to earn enough money to support families back home.
On 1 December came into force the law, according to which each migrant workers will be required to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
The FMS, however, promises that the time the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
The test, however, will consist not only of the language skills, but also in Russian history and of the foundations of the law.
Knowledge of the language will also be necessary to confirm to obtain and extension of the work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
And this law does not apply to people who have successfully managed to get an academic degree and diploma in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits, and the protection of the rights of
The test sites will be working under the auspices of The Institute of the Russian language, University of friendship between peoples, Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants may consist of tests in all cities; in Russia today is open to more than 160 such centers.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing support and members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, many human rights defenders in the press to ask the question: What's really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?
First of all, are representatives of migration services - will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the "slave labour."
Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says chairman of the board of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in emigrants without occupation, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language, he says with conviction Sebelev - is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with dishonest people who will help him on the pretext of "reference" to the awful, cramped quarters where he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents and work for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.
"In their homeland, they promise one thing, but after the arrival of a lover, seized their passports, paid the promised wages," confirms the main Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't scold!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to go, but do not have the experience or even with the work.
Of course, it wasn't their fault, but rather the disaster: Very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, shoes and remember to school.
As children mature into adulthood, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
"Do you feel the humiliation and inferior."
It is true that with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders on one important thing.
The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If you have not, so they won't pass the test, or they don't get any other official work.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers as well as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No admission for unauthorised entry prohibited"
Many of those workers say that to gain official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: From 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
But the false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that we are, in fact, false documents, no registration, and there are cases of extortion.
"Call for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - shared with reporters about his experience, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the validity of the language, it was found that migrants are not only false documents for registration.
Staff of the FMS already confiscated several fake certificates of completion of the tests.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free: Each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with the tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.
It is two and a half times higher than the official test is completed, it will become migrant workers three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system against corruption that workers could not simply buy the documents, that the same government officials as well as defenders of human rights.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who can't handle tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed a course in the Russian language.
For visitors who can't speak Russian, is expected to work in the areas in which does not require an active negotiations with people.
The MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not take into the circulation of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legally-held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia proposing a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
The government's response to recent events: The rise were cases of shooting at weddings, which are dispensed with the victims, and the massacre of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradovem, in which seven people died as a result.
The police wants to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and to raise the age at which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma's committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "tightening the screws" on the way.
He appeared in the open letter, which the authors - representatives of various social organisations - require the rejection of "tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, in an interview with the Russian offices of the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, within six months of the year 2012 142 crimes committed using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while over the same period was committed a total of 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons cause the offender to go to the "black" market.
Currently, according to their words can be found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the plants after officers
"Black" market with weapons is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years in the workplace of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that receive orders of weapons
The first of them, "the army or military path," that is a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"They stole weapons and Russian officers and Kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.
The other type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement authorities.
Illegal "mainly" comes into the sale of military stores.
In many of the military warehouses often leads to explosions.
"There is evidence that some of the fires were set deliberately, in order to cover the shortages," says a former soldier.
His contribution to bring in the words Barance and producers of weapons.
"At present, there are private armaments companies that are not competitive in the international market, and the decommissioning of weapons, which are on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "black market" is smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which was organised by their continued production," explains the former soldier.
Where is the gun?
The experts made, what is the approximate percentage of the sources of supply of illegal weapons in the "black" market.
A report on this issue come up in 2011, the Center analysis of the problems and the design of public administration.
Reports of the Ministry of the Interior and specialists dismantled Russian Statistical Office, kriminologickou literature and public data portals focused on the theme of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all weapons on the black market "because of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to the data, which are available to researchers, 17% of weapons from the armed conflicts, in 14% of the cases, the theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology."
The salesman-consultant to one of the firearms, who asked that his name not, is convinced that the weapons found in the "black" archaeologists dig long ago nobody is buying - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the sales drive for new shipments directly to military depots.
The Ensign was interested in buying the unit, for example, the TT.
You have a weapon with him, and he will sell it to you over the fence.
"That will take her to the city, where it sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," she says.
"The truth is that the police are well on track, and therefore they will burn the plan at any time in the detection rate for offences carry out the purchase of traders in illegal weapons," says the adviser.
"As in the luxury market"
The seller and the buyer often found each other through their friends.
I visited Web sites and blogs, until the guy who offered me the opportunity to go on a platform of "Test," where is the man who would have led me into the "corner" where we act together.
I learned the price of mainly to
Military correspondent Victor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need someone who knows the way out, tells the clerk - poradce.- like that I have known, but I don't trust him fully.
Sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to pass on to my daughter lost a tooth."
And now I get there through the man, which I am sure.
He is also the only to me, because he knows that I neudám.
Beginners looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Victor Baraněc trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when the working paper for publication on this topic.
Patterns, according to his words.
They gave him a photo album, where it was "all what you thought."
"I felt like in the luxury market," says the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential client, but I ain't buyin '- let's go with the seller in the forest and we'll build this target.
"Give me a chance to shoot, and when I became convinced that the gun shoots well, we are beginning to act," describes the procedure expert.
Magazine on the couch
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to the Web site and the group on "Vkontaktu" where offers to buy weapons "for different purposes."
There are no documents or personal meeting.
"If you have a set amount of money," says the headline on the website advertising "buy a gun or machine."
On these pages users leave their notification and ask questions.
And the sale of a minor?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moskva" - in formulating the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently threw a huge network of dummy websites and persons who wish to buy a military weapon, grabbing at the shovel.
People are as hungry fish to the bait and then conquer the coal in Siberia.
The military correspondent and senior military official Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes: Web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of the Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer shall make payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller sends him a photograph and description of the guidelines which is a weapon," said a spokesman for non-governmental organisations "Right to weapon" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baraněc confirms that after entering the order on the website, you can remain unarmed and wind up behind bars.

Makarov for 100 dollars
You will pay for the purchase of illegal firearms experts estimated that the amount usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova from non-governmental organizations' right to seek a "the Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon was dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage depots through the middle section.
According to the official statistical office declined compared with the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of solved cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Workers are on strike in the US, and supermarket fastfoodů
The work on the premises, "McDonald" goes through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last few days in America raised a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Wal-Mart and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
This whole share support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest increase for salaries, which are rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, it is the aim of the organizers of the protests to create them in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector virtually untouched odborářským movement.
The 46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America struck an orgy of cheap sales in the millions, and in some cases has been accompanied by the brawls.
On this day, some workers, Wal-Mart, which works worldwide to 2.2 million people to leave their workplace and demonstrating together with the trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational companies, retail chains, whose goods are addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.
Wal-Mart sells around the world everything from diapers to hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average by 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.
The availability and range of goods made from the chain Wal-Mart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics can afford to sell their goods as cheaply Wal-Mart partly because few pay their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.
The demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company have risen sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Wal-Mart worker receives 75 dollars per hour, but that does not match the height of spending, say officials.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion dollars a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company moves to increase wages Wal-fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers will spend about $12, 39 more than today.
Wal-Mart's defenders point out that the protest was held in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in stores the company lasted from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this period, the company sold about 5,000 Wal-Mart items of goods per second.
Overall, the Treasury carried out in the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
A representative of the company Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post Web site that jobs out of a total of "less than five" Wal-Mart employees, and that the protest was nothing but "another media sensation," organized by trade unions.
"Vacant Treasury."
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were trading houses to Walmart (those in that pokrokovém town are not very popular, and therefore are almost here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that sells billion servings per day, and then you paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York $7.25 per hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average they receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
No one in this expensive city, lower wages.
Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
Employment in the "McDonald's" almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter part-time after school and live with their parents.
Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood, or plans to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly in conversation with the workers, "McDonald," who complain that they must live on this money, and some of them even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal's comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at the "McDonald's" on the unusual Street and Madison Avenue, requested that the cashier and cooks in fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice the current minimum wage.
It also demanded that the fast-food in the area were based trade unions.
American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the establishment of trade unions and trade union activists to punish bullying and layoffs.
On the other side of the administration rarely makes life easier.
In the fast-food companies to establish trade unions, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.
The opposition
In this day of noisy protests also were held in a number of other low-priced restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the noon rally at the "McDonald's" near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's," says that sells billions of portions, and then you paid sick leave and not properly you for your hard work. "
The demonstrators also have the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we have to act together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker."
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food sector.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, it is as yet unclear.
"So far, the brain to deceive the average"
Among the fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; lately, it means, in particular, to see the world through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of this news, and in November it was announced that the application for the patent, as well as Microsoft.
In an interview with the leader of a group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that this company glasses for scientists are already a thing of the past.
The challenge is the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Tell us in general, what is your research group?
- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Mankind has been stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the most ever touches the screen with his finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility of proceeding with gestures.
- What is ahead of us in the future?
- Notwithstanding that Kinect system carried the interaction on a physical level, a lot of interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
To improve the flow of information (the system) is a lot of data, but so far no output flow.
We are trying to change that, we are working on a three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.
It is necessary to let the world into our physical world, to make it more realistic.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much better form.
And in the first place - to hell with those silly helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vocal control?
It is a popular thing to do, but does not exaggerate?
Of course it cannot be regarded as a panacea - there is the question of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not for long, only about such Tiffany, short.
The gesture would nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is great, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future is a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
- A how?
- How, for example, you ask me to give you this can of soda?
Say it, and at the same time you show.
- I usually just talking.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.
- So, you want to get the user to adapt to what at the moment may or may not machine?
- It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can accurately detect human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser scanners, which provide a good in-depth resolution, it is very important.
- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Today is not a sufficient distinction, depth, or something else?
- In fact, the current generation - that's what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional detection.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s.
But it's not just about the megapixels, but as a matrix and depth.
In the current view of the case are all the current lack of technology for us - that's the trouble with algorithms.
So we must bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So it is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the human-computer interaction.
For me, it would be very useful in the work of the equivalent of such a device, but I don't need as much light, but I need some extra frames per second.
- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In the Kinect system are now used three cameras, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and receiver, the reflected signal.
And the third camera - that is, in fact, a visible sensor zone.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A greater number of cameras could potentially solve the problem.
Or worse, because it would increase the volume of the necessary calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) not presented publicly his glasses.
You don't think in terms of day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course to go and constantly keep smatphone in his raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: The strongest option would be "portable" version of the reality, which would be based on the platform of the switch whenever buiding glasses on the smartphone, the projection display and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things you only see you), and also on the basis of weakness - augmented reality glasses allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which critics often point: There is no tactile response.
Hands don't feel anything!
What is your group's response to this challenge?
- In my lectures often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of the tactile qualities might have had one eighth breakthrough.
It is one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand as a kind of background for the display.
Is an excellent way to bring!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on the addition of these "images of solidity in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beam in a defined point the finger, a tactile sense, but it's still very weak - as if you blew on his fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that's what it seems that he should feel at the moment, when they see something?
- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.
Here is yet another challenge that we will fight for a long time - how to get a man who is physically located in a very confined space, to believe that it is an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and the huge balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, it is still work for many years.
That's what he was doing work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the very early stages.
Rosbalt.ru Vkusovština instead of culture -
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradska avant-garde," dedicated to the people who are in the lead, are avantgardou culture and the arts.
At the top of the list have already been significant figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often located recognition in Europe, without reaching Všeruského fame.
The new hero "Rosbaltu" is an amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - the bearded man, who is dressed all in red, which you see here at the Russian Museum, the garden in the summer, the fashion in taverns and vernisážích.
Images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the most purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it's obvious the man plunged the avant-garde end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, the city man, his appearance on the streets of a smile on his face, all in the mood.
Recently picked up the organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this complex role bohémským is ripe with all his life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why you're walking around dressed in red and not in the yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- 'I have chosen the color red as a designer dealing with light and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
While it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, aggression and waking up bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed to be established conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to the debate.
- And when you understand that you have to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky Prospekt Station, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
Then came a wave of unofficial artists old and new, free types of artists I couldn't understand.
I made friends with the new wave of artists, with post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the "puškinské 10," and the next wave.
This brings me to the theater, clothing, music, in all genres, in addition to the words.
- And it's all merged in your art-clinic... - For me, it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where should gather all the best forces of creativity.
In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there before the renovation, there was music and art club, a Bohemian Club, home petěrburkské bohemia.
There was much: Nome, tequila jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project "Ears Van Gogh."
Šnur under the plywood and his friends sang a song, they dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, midway between them, the composer Igor the dowager's, which is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programmes sworn-galivských times.
We gave them the Trachtěnberga, began his great career, basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Griboedov - this is the aftermath of Art Clinic.
This way, our workers and patrons.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, he organized the survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed me, that ended my top.
In the new times, according to the old rules of the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, integrity and the culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you may be popular, but not too much cultural.
- Your works are characterised by an identifiable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, which is vividly captured the timeliness and pervasiveness.
I will have the exhibition "Russian museum clowns."
The clowns are timeless categories.
Before, I used to be social, this is a painful and awful.
But the clowns are all the glamour, senses the tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in the regulatory system.
Today, people face under clothing, focusing on the external drive, not on the inner man.
Or maybe he could not shake hands and to spit in his face.
And the change will be removed.
- Recently, we have seen you in the role of the urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who could it be, if not me?
- A commercial art can be beautiful?
- At present, it should be commercial, utility art a thorough, tactful, sweet.
The collapse of the cultures.
In the past, people gathered in knots, La Bohème loved one, free from other people.
Today, everything was broken on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not stodolarová bill, I liked all.
Today, it is necessary to think about who likes.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of 100 fans.
- A Stasu Mikhailov comes several thousand spectators.
- The fans come to him, there had been involved sexually social sphere.
And on the cultural ground will be 300 people and 10 thousand of them, and the result is less management, money, everything is failing.
I have the fans, the main thing is that no one is fooled and not what is ingrained.
When I was young, I was painting the pictures that hung on the wall in one of the collectors together with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which people usually ends.
Today, people often confuse the concepts.
They say: The culture, the culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of consumer, it is elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of the previous day, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing images.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is in the Petersburg lack?
- Dobrých experts on culture.
There is such a concept: Churchman through the culture.
Not all of them, but can deal with the culture.
At the time of the Tsars, it wasn't ordinary at all, the Tsars may be too did not understand the culture, but understand that it is necessary to promote the real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In St Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are kept out of somewhere in a corner, because they are the great experts who properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today thriving vkusovština.
The same Erarta but differ by honestly say that we are not all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is it you Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk - it's Capital of Culture, in Moscow, there is far more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our waste, the art of doing poorly.
We need a cultural ground, but for us today is writers more than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us, it is a layer of a weak.
We need to make art has become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented by means of grant St.Petěrburku
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
The global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
The caravan of space ships with them on board, are on the way, looking for a replacement.
To save humanity, the question arises: How to keep your family in terms of gravity or to the spare the planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets that it is possible to embrace, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute P. K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live at high altitude, or in orbit around Venus... in the universe.
To address the issue of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with flora.
Already half a century ago were carried out experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit around Earth are no different from their relatives.
It was then carried out the insects in orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, was sent into space quail's eggs, to determine how the developing embryo in microgravity.
We are absolutely normal output of the bird.
But then begin the problems.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," said the head of the laboratory of the Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't support, the birds chaotically fall and somersault.
After 10 hours, occurred in the newly hatched birds to the total extinction of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the problem was that in four days just died.
"Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," commenting on the failure of an experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarcha" animals flew in orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments in the spring of 2013 will continue.
In biosatelitu "Bion" but they are only being one sex.
He ran an experiment with rats, who were broadcast into space already pregnant.
In fact, they found nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment, and such efforts should be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats born offspring.
The approach to the problem of reproduction in space, however, so far failed.
It is a difficult task.
Animals at the loss of the normal environment simply cannot carry out its sexual instincts.
The man, unlike the animals, in principle.
Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking and is able to create an emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not.
But the women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was Tereshkova's.
The most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Chaika, and no one on Earth could not say whether the last flight into space.
Whether it can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"I still have no answer to that question," says the veteran-space industry Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's daughter.
The father of the child was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, he was born the son of a second wife-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice, and who worked in an open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, which after years of birth and grow the health of the offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably find new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a stage of preparations for the flight.
Here in the conditions of zero gravity, the astronauts learn the skills needed to work in an open space.
Water simulates the weightlessness.
Though the water is even comfortable for adults, but in a way, in a strange environment for small children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is at an average of nine months in his mother's amniotic water, and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, after only two weeks.
"It is very little to a child something forgotten," says Marina Aksenovová infant swimming instructor.
In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness more natural state, then it is more natural for women inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In microgravity is very quickly to the wasting of abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside, if they work promoters of muscle activity in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the body of the mother, the fetus is expelled.
"What next?" Asks Valeri Polyakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs the artificial gravity.
If there is no gravity on the body, cannot properly form the skeleton or muscle system.
The newborn in orbit, it is not possible to dress as an adult in a suit with a burden, in which he could train.
They will be deprived of what it needs to develop unconditionally.
"If you go to the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be absolutely nepřizpůsobená our environment," says the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So that children born in the universe today is only a theoretical question.
Once again, however, the time will come when it becomes a reality, when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.
The head of the owls: Check švarcsystému failed due to politicians
The Czech Republic has good in connection with public procurement supervisors and high-quality legislation, but is lagging in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz. says the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we are missing, in my opinion," commenting on the current situation of Kala.
Similar findings also suggests joint control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice gives access to the so-called "Petr Nečas švarcsystému."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs to bother his checks - it is banned or permitted?
"The law must be set up, and if you order, you can prevent even the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech and German side, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was it?
It is a parallel control, which we started about two years ago.
Put simply, the European legislation regulates how public procurement contracts, followed by the various national legislation and then also the practice.
We put all of this together, and even if the review is not yet completed, we have a very interesting differences - generally speaking, legislation is perhaps "stricter and more sophisticated," however, the practice is in some respects better in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create still further and further, more precise rules, but it is necessary to deal with the application of the law.
What you can help this project, what it means for you?
It is a joint control could contribute to efforts to stop the refining laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, though it does not have a positive impact.
Cost-effective means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (but this does not always mean the lowest price), to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But, by reducing the limit of the contracts that we don't necessarily achieve.
Maybe the system into a "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they will draw much more easily than if the limit was higher.
You're talking about domestic problems in passing legislation on public procurement in practice.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar to the owls, or is it set up differently?
What the authorities, as well as the owls Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized like us, also has a college, but in a slightly different way, but in principle, the two offices are following.
The powers are similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal structure, so that the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - that the system is a little different from our own.
BRH can control only the federal money, we posed by state resources.
The public funds, which are managed by the county and municipalities, the control of the level of the federal courts.
As regards the legislation, so that it is easier than ours?
In general, I don't like it without specific data, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but I cannot say that it is in all the better.
It is therefore necessary that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it has to be said that even countries that we consider to be a model, are faced with a wide range of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, no?
With regard to domestic legislation, what was your office for amendments to the law on public procurement, there are already some of its effects?
Given that the validity of this amendment is relatively short, so we not yet in control of events.
Because we are ex-post controls, it is to be expected with some delay.
So far, we have seen it only in the process of preparing future controls - we started our new instrument, the risk of detection "inefficiencies" through which we run almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we've analyzed it - there is, of course, those changes will be, because their limits, the conditions of certain types of competition, and so on.
The approval of this law, therefore, is more for the benefit, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm this.
The problem here may be that she "tighten the rules" and can not be respected.
In the previous rules are controlled by the person committed (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.
In this way, the price of the law to tighten?
I think not in this way.
The system shall exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, not to punish those who commit formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how it is out?
Let us show you the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs bother controls the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does that mean?
Švarcsystém is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be set up somehow, and if you order, you can prevent even the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce obligations.
Can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but I can say that we're going to do anything like that.
In the law on public procurement are fairly strict rules about what is to be done formally - which is right, in order to protect the public.
But on the other hand, it is tragic, as the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we are missing in my opinion.
The roads are icy in spots, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic are icy and snow-covered roads.
But most of the roads are passable, somewhere with caution.
The Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning, the roads were passable, but icy and snow-covered.

All the roads are passable, the second and third class, including mountain roads.
For them, but in some areas still lie the remains of frozen and snow ujetého points.
Especially in the higher elevations increased attention should be paid to ride.

On certain roads in eastern Bohemia there is ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains may be on the road in a layer of snow, reports on its website, the Directorate of roads and motorways.
The road builders warn the driver before frost, it may be, especially in the higher elevations of Pardubice Region.
Ice may be in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlici, Shelf, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, especially on the roads of the second and third grades.
They are chemically treated road I / 43 and I / 34 u Svitav.
In particular, the snow on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlicke mountains.
In a layer of snow in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kneznou, and Trutnov.

Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month to be the end of the world?
This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with his band The Tap Tap, make a joke and say that we are the only band in the world, which is able to gather enough positive energy to the end of the world delayed or prevented.
In December, there will be a unique project three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to readers?
It is a national fund-raiser, which we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21, at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before the 20th of December from 21 hours will take place in parallel 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
End will be around at the time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone of 12 hours ahead of us, the end of the Maya calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, then we were all together with our art director John Augusta.
In addition, we want to amass the positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want the public to think about the condition of one of the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap, together with other performers also sang the national anthem at the end of the world, which is called "The End of the world lifted."
Today it is very popular on YouTube, will also be on these charity concerts?
Of course, in the very end, that is, if we can do everything and the end of the world does not.
Sing it all the artists on all three concerts at the same time.
The anthem is also a link in a unique live on Czech television.
He wrote the words to the song, and the role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We are also working with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we have a lot of charity events and concerts.
We are trying to engage in these projects is hard.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.
What will the proceeds from the concerts to the end of the world?
The equipment of an accessible training centre Studeo, which was the sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in Jedličkově Institute.
The school's students are regularly Jedličkova teachers and pay them in activities that are fun and are interested in.
The students do not have the means to go to the teachers themselves, so they are trying to make in this way.
In the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there will be a separate building in which we are with this project.
At each concert will be a few musical groups and artists.
According to what you choose?
We tried to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You learn all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombastic action" in the future?
In May, we will for the first time to appear at the Prague Spring, so here we have an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I would like to integrate with a speech in Washington and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you speak, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London, or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of disabled people.
How the way you logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members in an electric cart, its trucks must travel in the baggage compartment, and, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.
However, so far it's always handled without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways were well prepared for us, I wondered how many times before.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to výjezdům abroad you can compare how each differs in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and so on.
What you have not yet met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we're in Russia have seen that in the East, everything is still in the complete beginning.
Moscow to Prague is a barrier, it is still unusual for a man in an electric wheelchair he was in the city centre.
There is no such obvious, would you prefer to be wheelchair in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civic associations, which seeks to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, and what we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.
But it is important to note that the improvement and the improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe learning self move in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
But it's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, in that we have with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but a few years back what you made in 1998 to start it?
I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to do.
And since I am a musician, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I, along with my colleague founded the extracurricular musical circle.
Well, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).
But came to popularity in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we began to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that the work, which is not visible, in essence, as if there was.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
It was your goal to go to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning I felt the potential of the fact that I can do something different.
Showbusiness is crowded things, where one mimics the other.
In a way, it is logical, everything new is taken carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who can see us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it's only natural.
But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with learning disabilities are not suffering from all the things that we have to regret.
These are the people who can live a full life and develop, assuming, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I say that if something can people with learning, so it is not only shift for them, but for society as a whole.
This success has helped, too, that you are a hard taskmaster, as many people as you?
If we want to do a good job, we must be tough, and in many cases require some discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that he must go to the test twice a week, be on the product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, it's enthusiasm quickly leaves.
But the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people are leaving and coming, that can't be avoided.
Who has the will and desire, the door is always open for
It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency adopted Poland as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, like the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full-fledged member of the ESA, 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of projects of the agency.
However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Flights into space is devoted to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.
For example, remind the lecture A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, 6 December 1933 represented the thoughts of his pioneering work Entry into space.
The idea of a young engineer (born 1905) left audiences cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he Šternfeld for Entry into space in France, the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.
Vzpomenutý doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), later became a promoter of astronomy and space.
In the Polish magazines published hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski is a world-known promoter of space and his contribution was recognized by one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named on his behalf.
He was in Poland in 1925 built rolling the car, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and there is no details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to take the trolley or its application.
Information about the handcar dobového are known only from the press.
Since 1933, the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.
The research was Komórka techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Professor Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
Some of the materials, it is clear that the research has reached a stage of prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted research.
In 1937 he appeared in academic journals, a photovoltaic the interceptors designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year she work Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of rocket technology to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) to coordinate all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of his work ended the war.
Further work on the space after the war in the Polish press, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first is the mention of the company in the November edition of the year 1954 magazine issues in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotowicze, is designed to create a society that will deal with space.
At that time, running projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is a promising field.
Since the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish company astronautická snažia (PTA) to join the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
This function held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carried out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with dostupem 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and it weighs less than 5 kg.
Later, it was built by an improved version of the RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 started in the two-stage missile flight tests Bledovské RM-2.
The rocket was four feet long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Further development of the type we should be able to real scientific work - the RM-34 should have the ceiling to 14.5 km and its mission was monitoring the height of the wind.
However, in 1962, was suspended for further development.
The heir to the RM-type rockets became a missile Meteor-1 taken from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-layer, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32,5 kg.
There have been three types of (the Meteor-1A, -lb and -1C), different sizes of space for scientific instruments.
In a rocket Meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types of was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 probíhal v Leteckém Institute development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
They were built version of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Still, it is worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also under the Intercosmos involved in research into space on a Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after Vladimir Remek became the second interkosmonautem.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court to annul the law on public works.
The resolution provoked a lively debate on the public.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the various economic departments, national economic systems, is in permanent conflict between them.
This is the principle of free trade and free movement of unrestrained private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the significant differences in the cost of labour (wages), the price of tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in the fact that "you" the price of a competitor in order to push for greater market share and thereby increase their profits.
On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate the production abroad, or buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared with other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising social spending in the state.
The situation underscores the reluctance of businesses to pay taxes and to replace a national economic and social damage done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to give specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies are creating a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of its own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the government gave private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.
This is reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to make its own population adopted the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is happening on the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of employees in the field of employment law.
The result is growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already a number of years of public ticket of food for the poor who cannot feed their own work.
The number of these people are already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that have been properly employed people receive a wage that must be paid to the breadline.
But the scandal was published, and in the case of auxiliary staff of the federal parliament.
The austerity measures virtually all of the southern EU states quite clearly lead to the same situation, where people are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of the social level of forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or wither for starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that it will come into the country's private investment capital.
But there is a need to ask where it comes?
If it will be from other EU countries, then move poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to claim that the state cannot participate in the capital on their own economy that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity stubbornly insists on the view that the state should not interfere with the intervention in the economy.
Then we need to ask whether the private capital does not affect, now governed by the policy, and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.
There is a clear answer that, yes.
Evidence of the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation, as reflected in the field of corruption, providing reciprocal benefits law, which is practically everything reprehensible, but not criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds awarded the drafting of laws by private companies, which are often in conjunction with industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All the power that does not come from the people as they say Western-style constitution, but financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.
It is clear now that the liberal-oriented democracy is rapidly moving into the situation, as he describes in his book The Appiános Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "The state had long been in full decay and the authorities took over the violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and with stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any barriers and people went to vote with pre-sold the voice of the people... "" character of the neucházeli at all, so that once was as a result of this disruption was the state eight months without consuls "...." it is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only cure is in a bad situation, and that it is necessary to choose samovláda energetic man. "Appiános had thought of Pompeia, but he had become Caesar, who changed to take democracy for self-rule.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the current society is based on a preference for their own benefit regardless of the society's interest.
Private capital is not inherently able to understand and apply the benefit of society.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform more profound.
The causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes, we must therefore seek in the indiscriminate liberalisation of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of these systems can be in favour of the type of liberal democracy as a break with the expectations of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the elites in the future be completely ignore the possible loss of life, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition both at international and European level, the Interior of the Czech Republic, the government will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore the system.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen the state capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The chaos.
"Nothing would come of the violence, nor can never" Sting in the song Fragile whose main line in the chorus, "let us not forget how we're fragile."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild Amschela in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction.
One is for Israel, they argue its right to self-defense and the Palestinians belongs to the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel belongs to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to wonder who is in periodically recurring waves of killing the culprit and the victim, after all, the people of Israel, including the self-governing territory, born in the current political situation and the violence experienced.
My point is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, to whom, in particular, is already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can trace some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personality, which completely autonomously governed by their actions, or whether someone was standing behind the throne, who directed the actions to advance vytýčenému goal.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is in the hands of a few individuals and zkoncentrováno that this concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be regarded as the head of the octopus (if there is someone above them, I don't know, but I do not exclude that) - Rothschieldové.
Doesn't say much about them.
Of course,.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop linking his name with the highly criminal acts, which stood in the background and always meant for them to consolidate power, increase of wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks in the world and against countries which do not have shares in the central bank's lead or prepare the war (against attacks by Afghanistan, it was 7-5 after invading Iraq was the country after the overthrow of the Gaddafi's only four, but in the meantime, Russia is subject to the Central Bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist the family, died.
Abraham Lincoln Rothschieldově refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America, during the civil war began to issue their own money (the government) and he was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered by 1963, Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for a global power in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars of a Freemason, the 33rd degree of initiation Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove a large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estates in Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population at 0,5 - 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury, and do not consume too many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and the subsequent offering solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, in order to avoid a crisis like the one created in 1907).
So, after they managed to murder the heir to the imperial throne-U R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed the Czarist Russia the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and subsequently led to the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the release of the Second World War left the bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation by the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, which created a presumption of radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they had to do was to give the Germans a sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering leader and creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which had to play, and I played, the fifth column, sparking a fire.
At the end of the nineteenth century Rothschieldové prompted the establishment of the Zionist movement, which sought to establish a branch of the Jewish state, not preferentially in the history of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Already mentioned Balfourova Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler off the chain, which kept him at first international bankers, or everything that was made in the plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world community.
Officially, Israel was founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany 2.světovou off to war, the state of Israel was created by the outbreak of war in the third.
If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish nation, as in the other, the victims in the front line of fighting, together with the Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided between supporters and opponents of the people of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice begets injustice in an endless chain of violence, when it stood at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their desire for a global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, the international bankers had decided to give people a choice in the elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, loyal to the international bankers, a politician who is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and in view of the above moving through the control of Iran, which is 20% of all the world's oil (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what is now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will agree to a new world order."
A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individuals chip implanted at birth, which will make it totally controlled entity.
"And forcing all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be on the right hand or forehead brand to buy or sell, who is not identified in the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
It is important to understand: Who has the sense to lists the numbers of the beast.
This number indicates the man, and that number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When it is the worst call Hollywood
A crowd of demonstrators in November 1979 Islamic students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, the patron saint of his regime for several decades.
The situation for the US administration offered a positive way - to throw overboard the Shah couldn't afford, because it would fundamentally compromise the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.
The detention of the diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations brokered the Algerian government.
Their plight has sparked a wave of solidarity at home and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck's Argo describes one episode in the history of America has brought a small victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy have fled from her six employees.
The complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, helped the extravagant a cover story - went to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country was the location for filming the sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood.
The legend was credible, it was a film project in specialized journals, held a press conference, a production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "right movie," during a story, the caper - an example would be a series of Danny's teammates.
In the film, the mood turns - on the one hand, documentation or evidence on the concept of a sequence of Tehran (ikonické titulkové sequence are shown in photographs of events and the way they were in the same situation presented in the film - there are big differences in it).
On the other hand, the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there was the scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions -muži in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the office, on the phone.
Ben Affleckovi is remarkably successful restart a career.
From vysmívaného actor became a respected director, and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the Czech Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film, which is not taking place in režisérově home Boston.
A feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that warned older films place over the Hollywood standard.
He and Affleck in Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scene in the movie is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování actual events - the opening sequence of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotion confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that ensue when they move somewhere out of history.
A similar effect of Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes contrived (false staff at teheránském bazaar).
Too many times in too many places,
The director also had to deal with the fact that told the story in the movie does not offer much in terms of exciting scenes.
Quite successfully, it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - there's not all that smart (the scene in which the looming crisis will call on teheránském airport in America and chase down the runway is pretty far-fetched).
Argo's weakness but restlessness arising from the need to show too many times in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in roles Hollywood associates was very charming, but their characters would have more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.
Affleck film loses a bit of dramatic tension, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to appreciate the retro style and evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
But hard to take.
As a reminder of a sort of living history as well as proof of how far-fetched the idea of allpowerful and vševědoucích secret services, but will suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year publishes poll on the absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for the "absurd regulations or ideas from the EU."
"This led us to this last event, when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the leadership of major European companies," said Patrick Nacher právo organizer survey.
The nominees absurditami is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of premium rates for men and women.
While the women were still in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies objectively.
"Another incredible ideas from the EU can nominate people by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations are necessary and mandatory blending of biofuels into the fuel, which in turn is harmful to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or about the size of a hen s cages, which this year, significantly more expensive eggs.
Also faced criticism before the de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or phase out incandescent bulbs from the sale.
High-quality bananas have 14 inches
The camera is often under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a state or group of states (in the Czech Republic now and the threat of veto by the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby, as well as for the fact that, for example, have the highest quality bananas in the Union consists of at least 14 cm and could not have "abnormal curvature."
The European Commission, said that the only harmonises the uniform national standards that complicated business.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have softened over the opposition of some EU states, pointing out that the existing Directive lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the poll may be last year's EU regulation, which must be sold balloons in the mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU's appeal to the American research, in which the balloons are the leading cause of death among children's toys to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children up to 14 years in blowing into the funhouse frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home,
It is quite absurd and rule on the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece should instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire put forward in the polls, in addition to some of the above absurdities even EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
For example, the Czech Republic and then crossed the volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which was threatened with a large fine.
Organizers of the survey took the idea to pay for some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to the request for a grant.
These ideas, however, not in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicapováni that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for reimbursement, "he said in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As the argument that so many of us in the grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.
For the Czech Republic has continued to ports, we had to pay the EU Palase hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out of the Czech Republic to the fact that a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grant to obtain subsidies offered by municipalities, the Ministry for Regional Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, should go to write applications for subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although the regulation in the Member States could easily become a target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies to projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations forced the Member States.
Emotions among the Czechs is that, like other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to the specific indications of its traditional products, and not always succeed in this game.
The Czechs had a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians strike of the Olomouc cheese, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, for us, our producers have renamed tuzemák.
The rum can carry only products made from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products in the company of world-renowned feta cheese, Gorgonzola, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, for example, were already Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr and Žatecký chmel.
The EU's trade mark can also boast of the Pardubice gingerbread and hořické tube.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how a man that he wants to run for president?
I don't care about it, to be a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, so nekandiduji anywhere.
But I can't watch the last twenty years the country rozkrádá, as the thieves running, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like it, so I'm trying to come up with a solution to change that.
And since I was 40, and I'm an independent nestraník, I have no choice, how things affect than to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but then you went to the Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
The whole time I was saying that I'm going to fight for the Castle to the outcome of the congressional elections.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
But it is not my intention to function, function is a tool, how can I carry out his vision.
Therefore, I have the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not just that, as a nation at in the pub and in front of the TV, but that trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.
Add to that the media that a man dehonestují and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For me, to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's go to your vision.
You have to fight for the Championship started with the thesis material and criminal responsibility of politicians and rear-view property returns over 20 million.
This you have to change the law.
But you don't have such power as president and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you want to?
When I as a citizen lobbying to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it.
The problem is politics, when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, is rejected, and that the citizens lives.
As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without the partisan categorization and dogmas I can take what is best for our country, from every side, and to apply it.
Do you consider yourself more as a right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more to the left.
For me it is not important, if a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important for us to go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.
Always I will support any public good solution, even though it will propose the Communist Party, or ODS, and so I'm going against a bad idea.
Čertíte, when someone tells you that you are a populist.
But it interacted with what you said?
When you construct byznysplán in the company, so you have an ideal target and vision.
And you are trying to close.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals on which, in the world of work, or talk about them leading experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you would have just passwords.
And with that, in the long-term nevystačíte.
Or do you think that if you for people to walk and talk with them, that you can get, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on your side to enforce it.
If I was elected president, is not a problem to hold televised live, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they did not want it.
If there is a strong personality, which will tell abuses can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I'm not a genius, or an intellectual.
For his views and visions of trying to find allies.
In politics, I have only just begun, and for your program I try to get majority support.
The things I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't work, for six years I finish and return to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that in one person to do nothing, so I walked around a number of well-known people, as well as candidates for the Senate.
I went to Radimem Jančurou, that because of the amount of work.
So I at least support the investigative journalist John Lorencovou that rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who followed, most of the elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People navolili Senate so that it will be difficult to enforce the changes.
Still, I'm going to fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors or generals.
Are you considering establishing their own party?
I hadn't even thought about it, because I don't have time to check the history of each potential Party man, and I don't have the money.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about financial returns, what is yours?
The private property I estimate about 60 million.
In Prague, I land about 25 million, an apartment in ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for 3,5 million and Skoda Superb in a million, and then I have a couple of million in the account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, he was courteous to women, and at the same time, he fought against the wrongs and excesses.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, you have the property for 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but much of their own money to give you don't want to.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
To get into debt?
I bumped into the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that on my program might not be so interested.
And I don't have an obligation to pay from his campaign.
The cost of the campaign, in fact I will cover what I receive senátorský salary.
But I nevyžil from him, for example, I couldn't pay my son English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, so nekandiduji anywhere.
So, you will continue to do so you can live?
Didn't you say that these activities utlumíte?
But that has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As I promised, I'm part of their activities.
For example, a manager of the travel agency in the spring will be my representative.
People would like to be the Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I also need something to live.
How much are you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would put an end to their business.

Architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures are only in my head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books - 2 photos
"The building seems to me to be cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in the large enterprise, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I wonder what today we need the library.
They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old-style today, nobody goes voluntarily, do you?
Spijkenisse, in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, is holding a special record.
This town of 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To resolve this silly situation, the decision was made a few years ago to contribute to the general education and build seven nicely painted miniatures of fictitious reinforced concrete bridges, which are prominently displayed on the euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive but was less than glowing.
And so the city's officials knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: We need to have a library!
Winy Maas of MVRDV Rotterdam architectural studio, the insanely courageous column graphs and the contractor of humorous, often even cynical buildings, took issue with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003, with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission is still looking around in amazement and shrugged her shoulders, piling fresh Maas on their gifts, according to the size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban community."
So this is my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros stacked.
Revitalizačního is part of the project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, a mountain of books will be honored the second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.
Small-town gray, which still could not offer more than post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly town hall, for which you would expect more whiteface dairy is richer thanks to a contemporary architecture.
But above all, is now the first public cultural construction of Spijkenisse in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: Reading the Eldorado under the hatch on cheese.
The center of the mountain while riding the elevator, but the real space and reading passions arrive on foot to control the topography.
From all sides with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant street lamps clearly reflect the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see a park bench, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally there are shelves of books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a spatial configuration upside down and space for the reader, we went up from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books is skillfully exploited: In the middle of the office, the library, chess club, eco-centre and the operator of the technology.
Special comfort are black bookshelves, which are once again lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and the smell of the eyes.
Over the unknown building material shaking their heads and even the bitterest architects and engineers.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager in the municipality of Spijkenisse, on the question of the Standard.
And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a base under the roots-millimeter fleece of synthetic material.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textiles will last one or two seasons, and then it is ready to blow up into the bulky waste.
For the library was fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - pressed down on the boards of a thickness of four inches.
The effects of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Commission on Human Rights) in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that smells like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After the 105 steps you get to the top.
At the end of a nearly 500-foot-long journey will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus plants in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly about the humidity in the literature.
Gifts for the new soul
"I guess you wouldn't believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass areas a project, in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Vytápí and cooling the warmth.
Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in sunny days.
The broad glued wooden beams, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shield and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of you will fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited a new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: Everyone in the city a few weeks ago, he was invited to the opening to take a book from his personal funds.
It should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently stands at 70 000 pieces.
The concept has been.
The shelves are filled with.
"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation now has a new home all residents of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for show.
This is MVRDV worked in the discipline, which, in the jargon says the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse said the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
Finally, it is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the decision-making on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa Berlin poised on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, first suggested that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, it must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel prudent.
But at the same time, I think it will not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - without, of course, was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
The ultimately put NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of the policy, which was to run by the US, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the two lanes.
It is expected from them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think of it in its role of settling down, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
On foreign policy, as they are in France or in Great Britain.
What exactly is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows a readiness to take in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other major powers, Germany and therefore must protect their interests.
Should the economic interests of the effect on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, they must be careful not to discourage the public, but the elites in the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
I don't want to do but not to give too much of it, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
In any case, however, it plays an important role in the German.
Damage Germany's relations with the US, Germany, in the case of the two important decisions abstained in the vote on Palestine, for example?
I think in Europe and even in the US there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I don't think it was such a dramatic break as in the issue of Libya.
Germany, perhaps even get some respect.
It indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, the US is clearly called for the veto.
There are between the US and many European nations differences?
These differences existed as a result of American domestic politics always.
I think that the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation, of course, cannot take this position publicly.
I think the difference of opinion is not as great as they always seem to.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama isn't too thrilled Netanjahuovou policy.
It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile their close relations with Israel and the US position on the one hand, and with the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For the Germans, of course, would have been a little easier if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently the case.
Therefore, they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.
That is just what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
It is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player? Wants to take over the main role?
Or is it a leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and for the country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany takes a greater role, creating the post of mood.
That the Germans, not easier.
It is actually an old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to the various neighbours and views, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics now continues to decline, however, the EU is currently not filled that vacuum. Who else is there?
The Germans will have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them feel uncomfortable, and it makes them even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

"The protection of brands" in China: When are Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a label that is completely officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, enjoys protection as long as the real owners nezažalují brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law over.
"For foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect its brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of the protection of rights in the Far East.
Every week, he lands on my desk a new case.
In addition, counterfeiters have had a few letters, so that they can make their mark.
From Gucci, for example, will be Lu-Gucci and Prada have register instead of Prada-Kyus.
In this way, they are legally copied and German companies, sporting-goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens the folder the records of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
14 September 2010, left one Chinese company to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. The name parazituje and fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in the copying and violations of intellectual property.
In large cities are multistory malls, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.
But other cases are Pattlochovy. On behalf of their clients is opposed to Chinese firms received from the Trademark Office, the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," Associated brand.
This word focuses on the "Bang Dakuan."
This meant women who hunt the rich man.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It is damaging to business, we have to fight," invites Pattloch.
"Mark is diluted, exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive demonstration products.
According to the company's market research for CLSA China is a $15 billion a year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing the fastest.
The deletion of dubious records in the register of brands may be difficult to achieve, however, and that's worth something.
The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected the claim, because the name was contested after a long duration of the "market reality."
If the plaintiff has the misfortune of plagiátorovi must still pay for the damage to its brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements.
In 2009, he lost a legal dispute with Daimler, the manufacturer of construction machinery animals (goats, the company, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps on the concrete mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO 2.3 grade point admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of staff and space.
But in the last year, allegedly "the work of the emergency situation back to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed proceedings on objections fell by 22 percent.
It was one of the 57 000 of these cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints pending.
To do something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, it is an impressive numbers.
Last year it was CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than the year 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China is the tenth in the list of new applications in the world.
This also applies to the number of all existing trade marks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
It simply means that on average, each logon is 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Start against the dispute is several times, as shown in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
This group for more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans had achieved that was cancelled his illegal manufacture imitovaných car parts.
But the forger had secured the rights to the mark Freudenberg.
We would be able to retrieve it, because the name in Germany cannot be protected, "says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The 2.3 grade point CTMO then also rejected the Munich firm.
In two other instances, Freudenberg its rights, but the defendant in the case is still further.
It should be just as careful
Now the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be measured in the archives of the company had to even look at a hundred years old writings to produce evidence.
Five years ago the company Freudenberg counterparty in vain offered "a high six-figure sum in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what it means to us," said Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East and Europe will.
And that's when there are unprotected brand imitators.
For example, one Chinese producer, wanted to make the Freudenberg in Germany for footwear and leather.
This area of the business, the group gave up a long time ago, but was able to avert the registration.
"We need to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advises German companies to be very cautious in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law známková. Foreigners would rather have "anything that in any way is worth protecting, log on in China," said Wentzler.
Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the company Freudenberg in the last act of the drama to the mark, then I will have to pay royalties for the opposing party's own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed in the contested segment of the market.
World AIDS Day: Stomping, singing, help
In Heidelberg tested the Imbongi - and in Swaziland have the joy of orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
The story, which is much more than 8733 miles.
First, there is the sound: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's loafers are looking for on the dance floor time and quickly found it.
The one-two-three-four.
Then slowly swell the voices of singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, extorting and mutually encounter.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, combining the voices of his legacy of wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg Imbongi tested a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from human genetics researcher at the porter.
"Om" Obani "is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and also in a foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
The self-help aid
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that around the world there are an estimated 34 million people who are infected with the HIV virus.
The 23.5 million lives in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245 000 orphans after parents who have died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphaned by parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found group Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend school in the second instance.
15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the operation.
The guaranteed tuition, school uniforms and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means in the language of the Zulu "a storyteller," or "one who extols."
Fluent bantuštinou fails in this area, no one to talk, just sing.
The choir is rehearsing for almost a decade in the foreign-language songs, and sometimes it is also brings back where it came from: South Africa.
In the air a distance of 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is a village in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni, which is dependent on the strength of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected with
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in the small, how well the whole Swaziland: The highest rate of HIV infikovanosti, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carries the virus weakened immunity. There is no rarity that die in less than 30 years.
In this village was a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, in particular, members of the Imbongi saw many children in the streets, which lacked only parental care, but absolutely everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without a complete school education in a poor country had no chance at all.
At first, it was still a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But already a year later was founded the group "Voices for Africa," which has since been taking care of orphans of parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted disease?
The bacterial SPI belong to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent viral SPI, HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies is the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is spread among adults heterosexuálními us relatively little, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
The chlamydiové infection among adolescents are significantly more often than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
In addition, the human papillomaviruses among adolescents often occur.
As the number of infections has evolved?
Not all of the sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled at 3698 disease in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV, since 2007.
The year 2011 was about 700 cases.
That is about one-tenth of less than a year before.
What are the symptoms point to sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen and blisters or warts.
Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.
As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases and infections can be transmitted from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent the long-term consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least honorářům, which earns a chorus singing throughout Germany, to collect some money.
"We have to send a total of about 200 000 euros Esitjeni," says the President Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can impose.
Also takes care of orphaned children found shelter, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the Zulu says old women are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have even 14 orphans, give them shelter and care for children in every day to school on time in uniform.
Children who already have one, they go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman is society as well as two cooks, daily cooks for more than 200 hungry children.
"Play for Africa" and established a school sewing, built two chicken houses and, together with the American Health Organisation PSI so that many people in the village had HIV test.
It is not granted. Although the disease in the country so obvious, everyone is silent about it.
The king's 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."
In fact, rather strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his expected lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
The state-approved way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But even many migrant workers who took the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is being used.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
At least a little to promote cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi once every two or three years together in South Africa and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and the self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent is known from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such valuation is not only the mood and joy, but also has already sparked tears for many of the wild border troops.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit the children, over which they have patronage.
Even though this village hardly can be found on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than familiar.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," they say the people there.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is miles away as the crow flies 8733, dupajícím singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
Messenger probe found evidence that the ice is on the planet Mercury.
The thickness of the ice cap could have up to 20 meters.
The US National Aeronautics (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from the three studies, which on Thursday published a magazine "Science."
Messenger probe found evidence that in the area of the planet, which lies in the shadow, there is ice cap.
It is said to be at least 30 inches, and maybe even up to 20 feet thick.
The water seems to come from comets, or perhaps even from the asteroid belt, which came into the Mercury.
But none of the ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said the scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to clarify how the water and other basic elements of life in other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes and little robots like Phoenix, nepozorovaní Earthlings are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time to send pictures to Earth, a small window into the emptiness.
The picture comes from the photographic apparatus, which developed the German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, in addition, the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolve around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006 "planet."
This portion of the infrared image Spitzerova telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars, the oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pink-colored "babies" in the delivery room of stars.

One of the biggest and the sharpest images of the Hubble: Whirlpool Galaxy
Pictures of spiral galaxies, according to their colour become real works of art.
The picture, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius Trifid nebulae.
Trifid name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trojklanný), as the dark streaks of dust into the glowing heart hospital into three parts.

Photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cefea.
This 1400 light-years distant nebula consists of dust grains, which are 10 times to 100 times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from various optical and X-ray telescopes.
Shows a ring of black holes, which is about 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, which is called the ARP 273, Hubbleův Space Telescope for NASA.
The scientists call this a spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star the nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
Still, the cradle of the stars to the new additions.
Also, the star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, a new young stars are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a black hole there is no dust, but only the gas.
Scientists believe that it was only shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our eyes into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks that broker, are still deeper.
It was the largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had an average of five meters.
In the US, the Large Binocular Telescope is.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is enormous. Just a mirror measured an average of 10,4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to-costs.
Still, his average is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of cheap way of construction: The telescope is secured hákovadlem angle in the high-rise, which limited his mobility.
In the high-rise angle is fixed and the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
His specialty is the high increase in luminous flux.
This is despite the relatively small diameter mirror is the largest mirror dalekohledům in the world.
Using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in the universe, scientists are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help every owner of a computer, which can be available to its computing power.
Look at the post of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It is the Very Large Telescope - and a credit to her name.
The telescope, with a total of four mirrors can shine a light through the mid-infrared spectrum.
The Very Large Telescope is planned for the Chilean Observatory ESO.
Its main mirror is to have a full 42 feet and is to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
The images can be counted as soon as possible but in 2018.
Two Keckovy telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii in 2007 were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keckovy telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which in addition to those views into space and using the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea has created a new giant telescope - with a hundred-foot diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions of the universe provides us Hubbleův Space Telescope.
The images of distant worlds gives us from 24 April 1990.
Kepler space telescope is searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially for those that are habitable.
2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of the mission was found 1235 candidate planets.
In the picture are documented the final preparations before the Kepler space telescope.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be the first in 2018 fired into space aboard rockets Ariane5.
The primary mirror space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6,5 meter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
The scientists are based on the fact that the ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, because the Messenger circling the planet is much closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurements showed for several decades to ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.

The search for clues in a country where people are still relatively young 97letí.
Ride the mountains Talyš we can call wildly romantic.
The bus rumbles down the road with many curves along the densely wooded hills, wild rivers and simple farms.
Everything is green and lush, it almost seems that we are in Schwarzwaldu.
But this is the ultimate south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here's Talyšů Caucasian ethnic group, to which it is not known, except that he speaks perfect Farsi and ázerbájdžánsky and with a very old age.
The final stop is the Lerik.
This town prides itself on too monumental architecture of the Soviet times, which is in a picturesque mountain landscape somehow.
Tourists from Europe comes here. The arrival of the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
Of the 323 miles, eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth for which the country is due to oil in the Caspian Sea, to the country had not yet arrived.
Pilatus Fatullayev (48), however, is convinced that the Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May for the Grand Prix Eurovision Song Contest - and we will be here next year, the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatullayev.
Longevity is the director of the museum, about one in the world.
This is documented the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšů from around the country who are more than a hundred years, Fatullayev shows black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years had fathered a child.
The star of the museum is, however, a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, which allegedly was 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And, given that the oldest man with the documents was 122 years of age Müslümovův seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, and died in 1973," says Fatullayev.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children at the age of 136 he had fathered a daughter.
Therefore, the mistaken Şirali Müslümov at his age a few decades?
The ancient people in Central Asia, however, he heard and Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"A lot of people living in old age, and in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia is extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of supporting evidence, however, cannot be made no scientific proof of age, especially when they are missing from the registry office.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that the people who live in the area around Leriku biblical age very often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are more than 100 years old.
So why are so many people here in the south of the ancient?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh Talyšů that explains the specific genes.
On the contrary, the director of the museum Fatuljeva believes that it is in the diet.
But that's just the calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and dairy products, and many of whom daily drink a cup of melted butter is so healthy, bromatologického terms is not credible.
Or is it the old way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In the 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which claims that it has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole of the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí, which relentlessly rolling.
Under one roof there are eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzajevy. Both are already grandparents.
Bobbing around and two small children.
In the kitchen, preparing tea for guests, which is used in typical roundbellied jars ", he."
A series of white teeth Mirzajevy is perfect and the scarf hiding her long dark blond braids before us proudly reveals her son.
I've always washed my hair milk, so I didn't and keep the color.
"I had never used shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
The monthly pension for life
She ate only what came from her own Court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life I have not once did not buy food in the supermarket.
He tells me about her husband, who was in the Army.
It was the worst during the Second World War.
But things improved when the oar took over the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda is from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is around the figure of the father, who ruled as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
He was in power in 2003, then took an oar his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan, at least do not need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the situation so that we can live well.
And maybe he's right, and a grizzled son Mirzajevy: "Old people enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible

She returned to Cairo the revolution.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep ambivalence in the country.
The sharp debate on the future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president has pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for that we can do that, I'm responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, especially the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.
They all still hopelessly confused bickering within the opposition, they are scared.
The fear of "God's country" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologetically told that temporarily reduce the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend your to "save the revolution."
But what he wants 61letý engineer, who has the title of doctor of American University in Southern California, really, in that they have the Egyptians and the world.
The judiciary is to be stripped of power?
234 sections which stohlavé Constituent Assembly dominated by Islamists patnáctihodinovém hastily approved in the marathon, partly to raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, even in this proposal that the jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the vague wording of the Islamists and their associated legal free space to use for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least it sheds light on the newly added section: In all matters relating to the Sharia, you should consult with the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a big influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that klérus will exercise control over the legislation, which would bring the effective withdrawal of justice.
In the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation of the
The problem also is that it continue to be maintained civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody to 11 000 civilians.
Standing in the proposal, it should also stand to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and support her morals and values."
It is legally worded so loosely that it could use this section of the state institutions even control the content of the film art and literature.
In plain language, it does not mean anything other than censorship.
Indeed, there is no point in writing does not define an explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits the shaming or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
It remains unclear, however, what is insulting and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the wording that it is prohibited from "insulting people."
In this case, it is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of experts law?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which was submitted for signature Mursí and his words will be "very soon" to present them to the popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks, the opposition is outnumbered by Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional document before it starts to pay.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbáhí, who was in the presidential elections in third place.
The Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "to the dustbin of history."
Through short message service Twitter followers accused Mursího that they want to carry out "a coup against democracy."
"If a referendum, we will go to the palace and toppling him," said a member of the opposition Yasser Said.
"We're still not tired, the blood of our brothers is not punished," the media quoted Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several of the judges announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution,"

The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would trigger a civil war.
It Mursího supporters clearly didn't want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide which direction the country has to go.
For some, it is considered to be a majority in favour of the Islamists.

The Norwegian rakfisk: Most of fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway, is one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
It might be the secret of the success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a couple of overripe cheese.
Put them in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it a week.
So you can smell the stench of paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and the smell in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in the water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want to fish stank.
How is it, and it's getting cold, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet on the festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, nejpodmanivějšímu food.
"You eat it raw and then it shall zapijete glass," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General," which is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us people are eating small cubes of fish with a large quantities of alcohol.
"Some people have rather than the rakfisk aquavit," says Havard.
Beverage can smell of the match.
A few pieces of try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, which was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time, when she was in Norway poverty, and because there was no fridge, the fish in the fall as they arced away into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eaten - no doubt dulled the senses with alcohol.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, while the majority have emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of the immigrants are attracting a large amount of work, high wages and an extensive system of care.
The people of Sweden, an old rival, which not long ago was much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though a smelly part of the past.
Are among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds ($14) apiece.
Norway is the global reports often lack - and it seems that most people like it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still refer to with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called "event of July 22."
The Norwegians may find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," he says of the plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is a prototype of the Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English of the majority of the people here, it is absolutely fine.
Nepředvádíme, we don't like the pomp.
Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage of the industry's most of the money invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw money, which they had, the Norwegians were on their purse strings tight.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eating rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I've had enough.
An elk burger is certainly something else, and it's pretty juicy.
But the evening is a smelly fish here again.
Hotel in which I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk served for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most demanding fish.
They have a link to the live television coverage of the moderator with a bow tie is surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It's like a singing contest at Eurovision.
"What do you score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"
"This is our scoring, Håvard."
With the applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
The traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the city and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, did not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Facing a daunting task.
Mexico, at the time of the term of outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, but the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has taken an estimated 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence," the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shook hands with the US president, the president of Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
There are different views on the new leader, and in his old homeland, populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in a good.
He attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
Now you can go to the city for one of the new motorways, which let Pena Nieto to build these highways are a huge improvement from leaky and rugged roads that have been previously.
Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the Member of Parliament for the party of President Pena Nieta, the institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope in an interesting and real change in the field of security and economy that our country so desperately needs.
After continuous 81 years in power, the PRI party, ousted Vicente Fox.
Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos from within the party for Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.
And refuses to express opposition to the new president as a man without a significant content.
It's a very straightforward man, very impressed with an excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that has many of his former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad she cannot be contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.
Tucked under the traffic overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.
And the problems in the Autonomous Community, are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called in to help with managing the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
Only in the last two years were in wild places beside the huge waste dumps littered the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
At a time when he was governor Pena Nieto, was murdered in the State of Mexico, more than 1,000 women, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, Pena Nieta critics say that during his term in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of murders of women.
And, in the worst case, accusing its leadership of closing one's eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for a run-down neighborhood, Buendia Irinea shows me pictures of his deceased daughter Mariana Islands Luna and crying.
According to the official version of the Marian committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as if her body had been washed," says Ms Buendia.
There were signs of blows and had begun to rigor mortis.
It tells the story of how her mother, Marian looking down from a picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which is a single word: "Justice."
However, this is, as he says family, exactly what they have been denied.
Public authorities will treat me as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say, and silent.
"But that can't be right, when there have been so many errors and omissions," he says.
Sherpa, president of Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new president promised during his term in office will be his priority.
"I hope that the president will be the same as the governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI Olvera.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad she fears the most.
Bradley Manning complained of ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to rebut claims Bradley Manning on the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to have the case dismissed on the basis of gross handling Manningem in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of secret material in the history of the US, missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein Private Manning, on cross-examination at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during a hearing on the proposal to dismiss the case against the manning because of rough treatment at the time of the link, which is in itself sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that in custody thought about suicide.
Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never provided no evidence that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing through the military prosecutor Fein together with Manningem forms that officers fill out after meeting with Manningem in detention at Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011, held in the high security.
The officers manning questions and record his answers.
When Fein said Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that treatment by their guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even if the officers asked Manning directly on how it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said he has expressed concerns about the various problems orally and that officers who visited him, talking to him about these concerns and indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, did not.
"Wrote" no problems "(after discussed concerns), and it doesn't necessarily mean that I have to mention it," said Manning.
Judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why the treatment of his party complained in January 2011, when meeting with the commission examining suicidal thoughts, which a few months earlier, expressed in the form.
Manning said that in the course of this meeting was his intention to reduce the "prevention of injury."
The army said that for him this restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision of the suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody knew that I'm fine and that I wanted to abolish the system of injury prevention... so I can enjoy the high quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transported to the detention center at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once there because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what it is, and what is happening in the outside world, it was very depressing.
"My world had only to base Arifdžán, on the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattresses, blankets, slippers, clothes and glasses.
He said that he tried to walk, because it was sleeping or just lying in the course of the day against the rules.
Manning said that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned in the night, on the other hand, woke him, and he had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Private Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011, to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also said the allegations raised by in Thursday's testimony, that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at the Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates in the morning.
Manning said that at the time he was not allowed to hide his blanket.
At Friday's hearing by Judge Manning said that on the orders of their guards decided that the blanket could hide, postpone, but admitted that his orders to her that no one has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning said that he was last night forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the belt of his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that the night was removed from his cell in his underwear, his slippers and glasses.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account of his experience during his detention and that in the event of his conviction in a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense has said that he plans to Manning admits guilt in the criminal case, and that he would fight against the other accusations, because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all inmates held in custody with the maximum security.
Among the charges against manning is aiding the enemy, against the law of the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis of
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
The Mexicans have a tendency to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I was hardly his way through the crowd, and I came into the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
Arrow pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican."
It's ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves as "Italy."
So, I ended up in the "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
However, I don't have the vocabulary of native speakers, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for the "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
On the agenda were the issues that are coming around, when the leaders of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why is the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has promised that it will continue in Mexico's war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States, complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of arms over half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the representative of the United States to say anything remotely critical of Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And the children Montezumy start on the warpath.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico's relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the hostile feelings?
There is a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers possibilities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And more often than would seem to fit the profile of the person - dark skin, poor education, the origin of the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are now living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
Is to the United States.
And we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, so it never left him.
And we have now found no trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but even so, the lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood had come to the United States legally, reminds me of that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is a tension, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican-Americans resent it.
Even though he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know, is not a part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
In Mexico, for us as the Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to complicate relations, they want some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, combined with the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.
We should say to the American people how wonderful it is to visit the country, and the pressure on political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.
Well.
It is going to happen.
Too many of the hostile feelings.
And thanks to the income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
It is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how they acted with Mexico before one and a half century ago, must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still feel indignation for the manner in which it was dealt with their family members in much closer to the past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexicans" than I thought.
The old battles, a new Middle East
Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain the basis for peace.
Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such activity is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, it was changed many of the buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when it seems that the Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it means that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at present, there is not much reason for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, the fight this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most pitiful and most populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, revived regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, have been added to the side of Hamas, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say the Islamic crescent moon circles around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where there is a party / militia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.
And, above all, on the southern flank of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, not to Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced public opinion.
In the future diplomacy with Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has its price, and many of the Hamas rockets had been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as hard as always, many European countries also blaming Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
And above all - Israel to prosper, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Even if the rockets from Gaza since 2004, killing about 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which extends into the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are still growing, despite its illegality in international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If a rule in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we stay behind that wall and hit them when it was the head.
Perhaps the hardliners will win, but the Arab spring may change their calculations.
Even though the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, have little love for Israel, their first priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
The Israeli defense spending is higher than the cost of all its four Arab neighbors together.
The opening of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new Arab governments to heal its economy.
The fact that the president Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, is a good sign, and may be the start of something new.
Also, the Israelis would have to look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel, as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
At present, the repression of the democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what they say reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: Two states, Israel referred to the territory because of security.
In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a Palestinian state was more than an immediate offer of a virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term he ignored the show of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, entered into force laws on the ugly cigarette packaging
Green on the backs of the boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted a warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.
The Australian laws on bad packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors of the brands were replaced by general olive green boxes with ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body and the depiction of children and newborns onemocnělých smoking as a result of their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are required from Saturday the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.
He relies on studies that show that if people start smoking at the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that they will never smoke.
"Even in very young children, you can see that he understood the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell, together with their product," says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek and cites studies that have shown, for example, that children connect the crown in the logo with the idea to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase the trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more abundant.
"Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Another says that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette packaging of silicone used to mask the nasty boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal on the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company has sold almost 6 000 Zico wholesale dealers and expects the new supplies.
It is a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic groups to which the plan focuses.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that most vendors hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing executive in the tobacco industry, and you have only this small space for the promotion of your products, it is for you online space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in the evaluation of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average John."
We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put the work and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focused on how to deal with the new rules, rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the country within the World Trade Organization declared that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.
The decision of the PPW is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce a mandatory in 2001 warning pictures.
Now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia is resisting.
The pictures have no effect on me.
Just ignore it.

In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come with praise nudění.
They say that for us (and our children) is a good, sometimes bored.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And given that most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to get bored.
We should support the boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But I'll be back.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription on the boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and demonstration of the ideas to an audience of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience, "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to."
Boredom is different from apathy that the person is not involved in anything, but I would like to be.
He says that there is no need to do something for the apathy.
He says that at the heart of boredom is "disruption of the process of attention, joined in a bad mood and a sense of slowly pass ­ ing time."
Boredom can be a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a relationship, when people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem within ourselves.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when we only have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, in which a person read an article in the magazine.
Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so low that it barely noticed, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard a television program, reported more boredom than the other two groups - have had trouble with concentration, but they weren't sure why, and attributed the problem of boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on the difficult and exciting task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as the search for the bad parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you to get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and drawing, which are often viewed as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move around, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced - sometimes the boredom of my flight delays, the loud speaker, particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance to be bored than others.
For help with the measurement of boredom in the 1980s, scientists have developed a "Living for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many of the things that I have to do is repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do it all."
Using these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day, contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.
He said, however, that he knows that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Boring is good for you?".
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo ridiculous physical risks, playing games or abused addictive substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain does not always the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, you'll be happy to do that.
However, if you watch television, do you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you won't be bored, but learn how to entertain themselves or self-drive, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to the other," said the professor.
Your child will learn only how to entertain themselves, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of her.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of range of the business and technology.
Professor Eastwood said.
"We are accusing it of being bored needs even more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are looking for, in fact, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the free time.
"In an environment in which we constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is difficult to find ways to keep the noise down."
In Colorado, there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana
Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and a football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be in its state legal - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke.
Mr Orozco said that one September day he went with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, it was Mr Orozco issued summons for possession of drugs and paraphernalia for drug use and petty crimes for which the penalty is $100 for each - and set the date of the court.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado vote on legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use of hundreds of smaller drug cases, the answer depends on the spot, rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.
The police department to stop blaming adults aged 21 years and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But the more conservative districts in Colorado have said that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, a number of cities from the Denver suburbs toward the western mountains votes on preventing the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The head of the gossip and regulators in Washington State.
And are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use, and now recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But, as Mr Smith admitted no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent, according to which we can manage," he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, shall take effect on December 6, which also left the annual vacuum in which there will be no more state licensing system, but legal possession of it.
And there are complex mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the state's directive on the "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be more difficult to locate a licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, the recently-based research group.
21 November sent from the city of Aurora police chief Oates of his officers e-mail in which they announced that the city will no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the laws regulating medical marijuana growers, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In northern Colorado in the Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck is a stricter.
After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push for users to seek treatment.
Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, even though many of them are facing additional charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses, which was crimes at the time they occurred," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The response was complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the joint initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, already adults blame for possession of small quantities.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all the ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing in law enforcement, until the change," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the conflicting reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
It is for the district prosecutors' cultural barrier, "said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of laws relating to marijuana.
"They spent so much of his life chasing people that still can't really accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to a small quantity of marijuana, they like to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.
Advocates and government authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and at the same time also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan as the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates the legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice complies.
Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and those who use it to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in operation.
While protidrogoví agents probably will not break down the door to pick up a small bag of the drug, it is likely that oppose allowing the state-regulated business with recreational marijuana permitted by the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drug policy, the administration of President Obama.
Several Colorado cities waiting for the federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before they will be able to open any business.
Last week, the town of Montrose in the west of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will come into force.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone's license, and then we will have a federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what they voted for the municipality, contrary to what the state voted.
There is really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford, because I'm a conservative."
Their views are not only being attacked by today's college students.
I don't remember that I ever dreamed of studying at Oxford University.
As my father and my elder brother had studied at the university, which I think is the world's largest seat of learning, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And while I am at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed her bags and dashed into the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to the love of students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from a chipped mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was being harassed for one reason, and in this cradle of alleged enlightenment that was as bigoted and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask, why this up until now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of center is suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the protection of equal rights to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, says that because of his political views are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and they made clear that they were not welcome."
Ask for a position in the university's Committee on equal opportunities, to ensure that their views are free to communicate.
Their situation, or more recently the documentary for BBC Two called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Stories of the country: Young, intelligent and right-wing) on the student politics, which conservatives have described as odd and neo-Nazis.
The show was presented in a graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA, Oxford University Conservative Association), who drove a Rolls-Royce, he was dressed in a silver suit and silver head.
Conservative students at other universities say that he is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees are treated as a "scapegoat."
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association (the Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think that we as the Bullingdon Club, without meeting with us at all. "
A 20-year student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the JCR members access to the people on the right from the center of the worsening.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a member of a minority.
I started in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
A year earlier the university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree of the former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, and the Stalinists trembled.
During the first few days in the opening week, when the new students meet among themselves and with the professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which was to come.
I found that not only are professors in silence with conservative students, but also to participate in it.
In the paneled classroom was policy mining strikes, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture was the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and for what happened, I wasn't ready.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "the first paragraph, please."
It was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a dessert dough, was very bilious.
"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" He asked.
The other students snickered.
The tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you do in your spare time she took some basic lessons in French, so if you're too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.
Heartbroken, I returned to my room.
At the dinner I sat alone at school, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
It was a sophomore named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is the target.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
Most of the conservative freshmen pretending they are labouristi.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend to be cowardly.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of fascist pig."
You are infected.
The other students notovali with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How the Conservatives love?" Asked one.
Hitting each other, right?
I felt as they feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Sometimes I could lead a normal life in Oxford?
I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I would have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years in front of me to develop as a purgatory to ignore and isolation.
He was the only openly conservative professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was in my school.
It was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.
Almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for its parochialism and small-mindedness and for his shift to the Marxist-deterministickému view of history.
In 1997, he joined the place of Professor at the University of Bilkentské in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to commute from Oxford to her parents' house in London, seeking refuge in their non-partisan metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that Oxford I hate and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, were accepted by all the political views.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood.
Even my communist friends were always perfect ways.
His moist eyes became troubled.
Try it again.
I'm sure that this is just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted from the frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, in the course of instruction, when the next history professor in utter seriousness said, "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even when I was inside flushed with shame, I confessed to my parents "brainwashed" and I called them "old fogies."
Was only short-term relief.
The nail in the coffin of my career, my father hammered.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week in the Murdochs "newspaper.
My door was locked.
I was inside, and after five minutes that my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me usmrkaným wimp.
But no 18letá girl or boy in education should not be subject to such intimidation and rancor.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, which not only came 14 conservative prime ministers, but to date, which is also behind the undeserved reputation with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has elegance rather than the glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of fashion design," which was launched this week in London, told ABC with Naty Abascalovou, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszovou and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence Isabel off his back I English, is the only place in the British capital city worthy of hosting the exhibition Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed it at the start of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of fashion design," which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio for the last 50 years.
"I love this place," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story, which is "il Signore" Garavani sole protagonist, but without his cherished clients could not be written.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first room of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from the Aga Khan Salimy over Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdona.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of their social rise: A simple tailor from the town of Voghera, in the north of Italy on the international "Bohemian royalty."
Like the royal family, there is nothing wrong.
"They at least netípnou stub cigarettes into a carpet, as do some wonderful celebrity pop-music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy abundant and with grace.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heiniho" Thyssena and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelliová or Eugenie Niarchosová.
"Valentino has always rather than the elegance of glory.
And even so, is a star. "
Valeria Mazzová Valentine's
For someone who was the designer forgets or the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome went to him for dinner.
There were twenty of us and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decor, food, music, in all, and he felt his spirit.
Everyone was made to feel important and loved ones, "says top model, who started working with him during the Paris fashion week summit in 1995.
"Never goes out of style, because his proposals are works of art," he concludes.
The nobility of
Gravaniho life is the story of obsession, but really opětovaných ones.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House had been converted to a seven-foot-long passage, which offers an exchange of roles: The visitor will become a model and marching passages to watch the "audience" dreams that Valentin's masterpieces is wearing a dress that she chose Jackie Kennedy at her wedding to Aristotle Onassisem, costume, who wore Monica Vittiová in "Night," or of wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Dibaové.
In September, the names of the models as the Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxisu, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie of Austria.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006,
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino's first love, "not to forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was the pants, shirt, vest and jacket, "Gillette" from the autumn-winter collection from the years 1971-1972.
It was a gift, which he did for me, "says Naty Abascalová, one of návrhářových muses.
"I give him in front of the other priority for his femininity and a great love for women, because it highlights our beauty," added the former Duchess of Ferii.
"I love the colors, which uses a lot of rozjasňují and give the" spark "face.
The proportions are perfect. "
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d '5 cannot forget how, for the first time on Valentine's Day.
As a teenager, and lived in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes.
At the end, in the late 1990s.
"My first dress from Valentin I bought for the occasion, the celebrations in the castle of his cousin, Prince de Ligne Edouarda.
It was the red dress with a skirt with flounces, and drape the bodice of a strapless top.
It was a dream that became a reality, "says the widow of Rodriguovi d '5.
"Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless," says the Italian aristocrat whose life is between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d '5 has stored návrhářovy formal dress "very carefully... because the clothes are not just clothes, it is also a set of memories that are in themselves."
"The King" fashion
The centerpiece of the exhibition at Somerset House, the wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller from her marriage to Paul Greek in 1995.
To create such a thing with panels ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, 12 different types of lace and a long four and a half feet were to be four months of work and 25 "girls" (as he calls the designer of her seamstress).
According to journalist Suzy Menkesové, the highest authority of the specialist press, represent the landmark summit fashion clothes end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from high society."
Over the years, Valentino blinded by the elitist "savoir-être" is now the best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest decoration in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated order of the Legion of Honour accumulate so many accolades as any of his clients.
"My attention always attracted his vybranost, quiet, neat and perfect appearance," acknowledges the Princess d '5.
"The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum d'Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
It was the perfect time to leave no trace. "
If it says the princess.
The hardest job in the world: The Kawah Ijen volcano sulphur in the area
The four euro gamble in the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, as are 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who actually work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners, who make their living from Kawah Ijen volcano sulphur extraction in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day fárat to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escaping from the interior of the Earth and in contact with the air passes into a solid state.
After all the large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carries on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone paths.
At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it is a mere 250 meters, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes before they get the tortoiselike pace up because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected his steps to nezřítili neuklouzli and into the abyss.
They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as happened one French turistce, which collapsed years ago from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulphur, which earns
When they are at the top, making her way past the tourists who took them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, and tired of carrying the heavy weight of the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which benefit in the volcano since 1960 and never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this product has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As it is commonly worn by 70 pounds, earn about 46 000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip," explains us Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One way it takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but so can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what it earned in the field.
"The miners' daily wage here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," says Porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for good reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulphur: "I'm married with a young girl from Bali, which is Hindu, and I took her to Java, converted to Islam."
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases
In his 27 years of Anto three times daily risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur, it has already begun to take their toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing and irritated eyes are toxic gases escape from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for it to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years, because I want to open a business or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.
This charming and intelligent young man in fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or the reception in a hotel, and instead of doing the work of the media.
Shares the dirty wooden shack with other carriers and every day she gets up at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur in the night and continues to build up its distinctive yellow color changes in the dark blue and September.
Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto sheds light on his way into the crater and a small lamp, which is mounted on his helmet, and he bought it for their money.
About 400 media are on the shoulders of the sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulphur nezmechanizovala because of cost savings, or provide porters working on their own and with such vigor, no equipment.
In fact, and do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) from a surcharge on photography, which, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) to collect the natural park from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year old porter who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left the school.
 He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it will work, "as long as you can," because he needs the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano was my whole life
Although the sulphur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick fumes that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems into arthritis, pain in his knees and shoulders wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.

Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapurci waged that do not have children, a career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot, carry out our civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan for lifesavers, but despite - or perhaps because of - the video at the beginning of this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints like "we bun in the oven" as a mockery of birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BUT, who created the video, hopes that they can draw attention to the problem of this advertising humorous way.
Artistic Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to fulfill their "civic duty."
"This is solely a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a topic that we need to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to expand on a lot of things like perfumes with pheromones or to organize an informal dinner parties.
Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing, such as the composition of rap, to solve this problem. "
1.2 children of
The one who does not take it too lightly, the Singapore government.
1 spends $300 a year to encourage people to have more children.
The government's package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures have had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known konzervatizmem its leaders and strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate has exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a measure of recovery, in 1976.
Why Singapurci do not have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, director of the marriage and the family of the National Bureau of the population says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it is not only marriage and the family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While in the context of immigration policy, there were efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of inhabitants, it has caused resentment among the local population.
Some of Singapore's website to see the overt xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the election, trying to tackle the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make is not so small home.
For example, began to affect the trade in real estate.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain urban areas.
These apartments are in an area of 46 square meters and had great success in the marketability.
However, there is concern that these flats may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the developers El Developers, claiming that their "shoe box" sold far faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, and it will sell for days to weeks faster than houses with bigger size.
Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "
However, he admits that the new rules are clearer rules developers, who were previously limited to offer too many small houses in one of the project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city-state.
Although the new rules could lead to an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will have a big effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, is that a lot of people," says the young officer.
"The others have children.
But for me, it is important to rely on their own time and money, "says another, about twenty, young man.
Men and women have a career, stress and the cost of living and education as the reasons that prevents them from having children.
So long as the government is trying to force people to have children, they are eventually Singapurci, who have the final word on the creation of a family.
What's private is private online and offline
The privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, is something that is personal in nature or the "area of private life that everyone has the right to protect themselves against any disruption."
What is this privacy for people under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
He understands the dangers to which it is exposed when published on the Internet, which would certainly didn't tell anyone in the normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, consider the concept of privacy as "something entirely its own" on a personal level and for the "user name and password," if it was a social network.
"My biggest secret would be published," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secret, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"The FB I pretty pictures or pictures of how we play.
He also said there are known.
I did not share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would embarrass someone, "he says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, pictures of naked people or photographs of the crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says that he knows all 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of the relatives.
Among them is the mother, who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
"I opened an account on Twitter to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if someone says to me, I'm just, "he says.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Even if he didn't care if someone recommended by a stranger.
Case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager's own accounts on the networks of Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at last the network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from your list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of that, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, he didn't instruct one of them for anything, even after it didn't address or telephone number.
"If over me or demand it from me, simply remove it from your account," she says.
José volunteered to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boys are not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
"The famous friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was, "confirms.
The victim, according to Jose neodhlásila from the account.
"I just activated the private mode."
Then a series of steps explains how to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge published pictures of this boy, known in the unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it, if someone was or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know that it is cyberbullying, "he says.
The key questions
Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and graduate of the Education and teaching, believes that for children and adolescents in their social networks correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
It states that: "The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but when the social network, has changed the rules of the game."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article, digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants who need to learn, and they're still learning, "he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say and what is not, in an age when they are not yet ripe."
Also to be - with regard to the surroundings - reasonable, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.
According to the Specialist is the most effective way to show children and adolescents, what's privacy, asking questions that force them to think.
"Tell them to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: There are things that you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone published a picture of you as you publish a pal's?
Do you know what the rest of you published?
When are you calling the person in the pictures of the celebrations, did you ask them for permission?
And one more: They need to keep everyone to know what you're doing?
The other point is to realize that they must behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
"One out of the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be on social networks," he says.
The supervision of
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that the parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If you understand every guile, they have a good basis to talk with their children about the consequences that may be opening an account on the Internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish, "he says.
 Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers."
The summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima was not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without being issued the Declaration of Lima, which indicated that it was supposedly signed by the presidents of seven.
The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who at the beginning of the set that the document will be published at the end of the summit, said that it will be later published on the website of the Peruvian government.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollantou Humala in a few short press statements.
Journalists throughout the summit should have limited access to information.
In the press room during the negotiations was transmitted by video from the presidential meeting without the sound of the report "confidential meetings, designed to prevent the transmission of sound."
A small amount of information that should be available to journalists, press spokesmen were granted some governments, who have been meeting here, but not the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the negotiations, a list of participating presidents, which triggered the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more information.
Peruvian presidential media office later sent an e-mail, "the final declaration" of the summit, but it is just an expression of President Humaly, and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Peru last October hosted the third summit Jihoamerických and Arab countries (América del Sur-países Árabes, ASPA), and on this occasion it was originally promised the Declaration of Lima published, even though it was the press was required.
On the official website of the ASPA can find that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings to the Peruvian authorities to ensure the broadcast for all journalists, but completely stop the flow of information.
The summit was, among other things, the common commitment of Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles the dispute on the border between the two countries.
The president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and the President of Chile, Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which starts on Monday after hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss the dispute, which opened a Lima against Santiago.
"Are we going to do, and the judgment to resolve the dispute, which today we are discussing with the international court," the president said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñera Humalu and greeted the president with a handshake with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents, to submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week by Bogotský pact, which has expressed its commitment to the judgments of the international court, which ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua and Colombia, this decision was totally wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the organisation Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of the then President Fernando Lugo and the meeting did not appear.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for the start of the morning speeches and the conclusion of the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read out the final document, which reported that it was adopted 16 agreements and was scheduled activity on 31 projects between the South American countries, with investments amounting to 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements mentioned that the member countries of the Unasur will make "important steps towards the goal in the form of a South American citizenship, which is extending the stay."
Informed that they are supported by actions to improve cooperation in the fight against "civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to drugs and low-cost Internet in all corners of South America, and to the common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "does not have the economic consolidation (Latin America) winning the substance, but is intended to increase our productivity and make a better future for our peoples," said Humala.
"We decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links to various places in South America, especially in rural and border areas... that our country should be better connected and create new economic ties," he said in a speech čteném Peruvian president.
He mentioned that five of these projects relates to Peru and transverse axes its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are related to a better relationship with Ecuador, however, did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
One of the issues that the summit was the need for Latin America continue to be prosperous and peaceful area, which is solid and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, said Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos prior to its participation in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet in Mexico on Saturday with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the dispute over maritime borders, which is disputed by Bogotou.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) to meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with that country," he said.
"I hope I will be able to say to President Ortega, who led the negotiations to the more civilized and the kindest possible form," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico, where they were to attend the inauguration of President Enriqueho Peñi Niety.
At the summit, the EU defence ministers provisionally met to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the defense field.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last of the country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary president of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe's integration of
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, "South America, in this case, you really must learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit Jihoamerické Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they're practically one country."
In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which the member countries of the Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any South American country, which is already underway between members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that we want to go back to the past," he said.
Among other things, Ecuador's president, said that he agrees with the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that it will be reduced to the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
"Those who are in the lead, never to do anything, and we all signed the South Americans.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, is funded by the United States, "he said, referring to the political asylum granted Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he has no regrets about this decision, because it betrayed its principles, and his "profound respect for democratic values and human rights."
He said that at the time, "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice, who asked him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory because of an alleged sexual offence, "own Swedish legislation enables the videokonferenčním call, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa has said that there is a risk that Assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he is in the embassy, and the ambassador has informed me that he has a lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorean head of state.
"There is, however, that his physical and psychological condition deteriorates because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
It would have affected the health of everyone, "he said.
President Correa said that resolving the asylum granted Assange from June to still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and pointed out that the London talks in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We're not negotiating with respect to human rights, in this case, we don't use that word, but still continued talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings in the various European bodies, "he said.
He said that "if the United Kingdom will pass tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears the still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the legislation without a problem, as has been done in other cases, this problem will be made tomorrow. "
Correa took advantage of this situation to be presented as a defender of freedom of the press, and make it clear that he does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lies which undermine the freedom of expression."
The biggest enemies of a free press is not us, mean-spirited and vicious politicians, but bad news in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, "he said.
From this point of view, expressed his pleasure at the fact that no such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic control over the country and even the bourgeoisie Ecuador," and said that, if re-elected, "will continue the changes led by the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto by Paraguay on membership in the Union Unasur until at least its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped in the legality," because in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, Ecuador's president, said that it is "entirely appropriate" for the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment the judgment is not accepted.
"It is a problem between the South American and-countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome will walk together.
It is widely considered to be overcome, and was able to go forward. "
It also expressed the hope for a settlement of the maritime border, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "the right to search for Latin America is an international resort, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, whatever it hard."
In connection with the possibility that he may run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to run for a third mandate, he said, that he sees the possibility of "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, retire from public life.
"I personally never cared much, but so unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only to political power.
My political movement believed that I who guarantees this unlikely victory, then we must accept this responsibility, "he said.
"If I had won, it would be my last term, and then I walked away from politics.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
I've decided, "he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez has left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected at the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the health of the president, "he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian state is now part of the sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain the development, equality and security.
The AIDS victims are the result of the late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results of his test: HIV-positive.
"It was as if the lightning struck me," says the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "mitigate" a bit, but apparently without success.
The boy's in front of the family.
He decided to take his own illness on their shoulders and began to inform on her and with such vigor that he celebrated the 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the earliest Units of HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, the director of the clinic with him or the Social Security Institute (IMSS) said good-bye, "because he was cut."
That was when AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.
However, there are a lot of people don't know about his illness and come when the virus has caused the destruction of the body's immune system and vysílil, and become the victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the life expectancy of the patient, who in a timely and appropriate manner to begin with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of Unit of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and an expert on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability, the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, the better are those who are taking drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the one who is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in compliance with the treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems," he said in an interview with the doctor.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearbook Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics, 60 percent of patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco in 2011 255 people died, and in May, 187. However, since 2005, is a universal access to antiretroviral therapy.
 - Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease?
 - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities of access to treatment.
The way I see it, that's going on with us in the hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have not run out of supplies of medicines, the problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease. "
Adds compelling figure: "Nine out of ten patients comes when there will be an associated infections. What needs to be done, we could have more impact on the overall mortality rate is used to diagnose the disease, and therefore it should be on a large scale to offer tests to detect the disease to all persons who request it."
In its proposal is consistent with specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came into the private lab tests to be done just because it was his friend, and despite his young age he had already suffered from AIDS and Kaposi s sarcoma, a cancer which is one of the most common complications.
"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I have to die, I'd rather be vyřádím three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. "
To this day, his parents knows only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person, "lists Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco that today, in the framework of the World AIDS day motivated their testimony of those who are afraid.
"Whatever they do tests. If risk, so let them know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, it's better, and if you have been diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, they will be held accountable."
This sums up his message to the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in the prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
The nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want?" Is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and medical personnel that adolescents want to avoid, he tells a reporter.
He suggested this inefficient distribution change. Condoms are not just for the consoles, but the hundred dávkovačích whatever is in public restrooms, in places frequented by young people.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
"It's not to pay them a beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to the question of whether he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his district.
Takovásexualita. It is best to make condoms to those who already have a sex life, "he said.
The key figures in the state of Jalisco
There have been 13 435 cases (12 of 158 cases of AIDS and HIV-1 317 cases).
This is the fourth place in Mexico in new and recorded cases of AIDS and the 13th place in the context of HIV.
92% of the diseases in a sexual way, 6% and 2% perinatálně blood along the way.
It is estimated that the HIV virus can live for about 50,000 people, because on the one registered case is four to five people who don't know about the disease.
The judgment of the court of appeal in the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company Grupo Vitro established bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country, and the problem of solvency.
Therefore, it seems that corporate restructuring procedures, which allow Mexican laws in the country lanes and stars, despite international agreements does not apply.
The approval of a decision by 15 June last year, a judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves the Mexican firms in practice without a defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door for the Mexican producers of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against the three irregularities.
First of all, it should be noted that while the judge in this case contends that the creditors are governed by the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides for the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, it would suggest a lack of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.
In fact, it was for this purpose, the United Nations created a model for the unification of international trade law, which determines the organisation arbiter of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without a vote of branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, would not achieve the required majority for approval of the restructuring.
However, the possibility of Mexican laws allow.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose in-house debts guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Technology.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the creditors - who would be against the company Vitro stood before a court in the United States, which funds "vultures" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - not the majority.
In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.
From another point of view, blaming the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck in the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for reconsideration of the Court of Appeal that the examination was carried out with the full participation of, that is, with the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three.
If he fails here, it will require a revision of the appeal process higher instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is significant that the court failed to document sent to the Mexican government as the amicus curiae, which is described in detail the company Vitro under the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had eased by adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to confronted the law with Chapter 15 of the insolvency law of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: The penalty for the company Vitro and state.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was linked with the Salo sport for more than 60 years and traveled with him all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories in the history of the local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he was caught by a stroke in 2008 in a wheelchair, dedicated to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player under the categories, a National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or the president Portorické basketball federation.
"I was in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, like when I was in the 1990s, president of the National League BSN, general manager and president of the Federation of the national team," said Reyes when visiting reporters from the newspaper Primera Hora at their home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years, with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes in his statement wasn't exaggerating.
The walls of his house, almost all of which are decorated with pictures and souvenir of his long career, show it.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all are those that are reminiscent of his tenure at los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with the team los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in the eight championships, whether as the owner, co-owner or trainer.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one playoff - in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome Mincy.
Then the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach and by the time he was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told me:" I've got a big 6-foot player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.
I then recommended Bartow rozehrávače Gausseho Raymond, who became a member of the team, and one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy Bayamonu will bring victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to the next. "
The championship, when he played for the team los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, because already in 1988 as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote his functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up, but we have the bronze for the Canadian referee, who let us repeat the final face-off, "said Reyes.
A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team that you have ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in Panamerických Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we have guys trounced the United States team, which was quite similar to that we blew bronze at the World Cup.
This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico Lopez and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.
The team, which may not be perfect, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, a team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentine Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who had replaced the players ruled out because of the fighting in Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we won the gold.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
The number of international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level of such results as Piculín.
Not to mention his involvement in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The young, I very much like the work of Leo Arilla.
His success in the Federation is the biggest?
I was part of that era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s was National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What you couldn't prove it?
There were things that I wanted to introduce, as the division of youth categories according to regions.
For example, the boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the children a lot of travel and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in the mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees.
I am pleased.
What are you now?
The most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world-famous for the role of John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR" in the TV series Dallas, in which the two men who had acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, the role of the oil tycoon JR Ewing in the TV series Dallas has become a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in a new series of Dallas, has died, according to the official announcement of the family, which the Associated Press has provided the Dallas production company Warner Bros., Friday afternoon from complications associated with cancer.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played the iconic role that he favored," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the leader of his wife in the original and the new series, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, sweet, kind and talented and I will miss him terribly.
It was a unique and lived his life to the full, "said Linda Gray in the notice.
Hagmanovi was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted that he drank a lot of years.
In 1995, he was found a malignant tumor in the liver and Hagman underwent the transplant.
The summer before broadcasting the series on TV, Dallas, Hagman known as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie NBC broadcast station from 1965 to 1970.

Its role in the movies included roles, which have been well received criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was when Hangmanův master performance in the form of an incredibly repellent J.R., who led him to the top.
The dramatic series on CBS station Ewingů clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot J.R.?," which should lead to expectations on the part of emotion when Hangmanova figure is almost murdered, caused not only a huge range of speculation viewers around the world, but also the risk-taking millions of dollars in sazkových offices.
It also helped to achieve the record of this episode in the ratings.

J.R. shot his sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin with J.R. became pregnant and that she then threatened to mark her as a prostitute, if he leaves town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy grasping with charizmatickým smile: Wily entrepreneurs and unfaithful husband, who was trying to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, was closed to the hospital.
"I know what I want to have J.R. on a headstone," Hagman said in 1988.
There should be: "Here lies an honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't work.
Victoria Principalová, who played in the original series, said Friday at Hagmana as someone who was "great on the screen and beyond."
It's an unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have had the good fortune to know him and love him.
Ten parts of the new series of Dallas broadcast station TNT a few months ago with great success.
"It was a complete set of five parts of the second row and the sixth was shot," she told the TV station.
Immediately after the death of Hangmanově no statement was available from Warner from the station TNT on how the series will continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who appeared in the classic works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl, when she gave birth to in 1931, Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s he tried Larry luck with theatrical scenes in New York and then in the years from 1952 to 1956, he served in the Air Force in England.

The course, which examines the "end of the world."
Every week, students will examine the apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to do a course this semester on the end of the world, he knew that it is an irresistible temptation: The end of "a number of" Mayského calendar that has come December 21, caught many people as evidence that the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: The catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call "Armageddon" debt, and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place where Christians teoretizujících by the end of the world to begin the Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be nejapokalyptičtější semester ever," said Charmé students this week, Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When one discusses what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember that the wrong means for the apocalyptic-minded good.
And it is not the only professor, which offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is, in theory, the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry vacker course "Means, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students will examine the apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss these ideas to expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that are governed by some human behavior.
If, for example, the nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.
This month, students analyze films with apokalyptickými themes and examine how they differ from the examples from real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and the impossible," says vacker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania got together Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, to hold a course with a simple name of the End of the World.
"Nepřipojujeme" 2012, "because we always expect with the possibility of a rate again in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" to students to study, create projects and make the final test.
At Penn State, the final test will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes students no choice but to work "until the end of the evening in the world," said Restall.
The courses have become quite popular.
"Spread within two hours," said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which had 35.
For weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mail questions whether it is still in place.
The students have been assured that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console ourselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And, therefore, the apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs, it is only a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, 25 year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it might teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a professor, said that he believes in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan predictions and vyvracíme it in some way," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá student last year at Temple of West Chester.
"The Mayans never had not foreseen the end of the world; it is a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back centuries in which people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.
Such speculation has caused the Internet to flourish.
"Some people think about it," he said.
This is in the vast majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, the question of whether there is a course on the "end of the world," he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not the end of the world," he wrote, and he made an exception for the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall said that during the years of talk about the last days of the court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking about the next date immediately," or philosophy that the 21st December is the start of a seven-year period, at the end of the world.
Date take lightly the students and professors.
Several of them said that they intend to go to the "end of the world."
"I guess I'll call a few friends, we laughed together," explained the twenty-year-old communications student Samir Ford.
