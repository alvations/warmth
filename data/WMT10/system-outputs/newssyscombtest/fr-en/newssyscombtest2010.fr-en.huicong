The shortage of snow in mountain concerns the hoteliers
Unspoilt tracks were not a problem that the operators of ski lifts are planned .
The lack of snow discourages people to book their visits to ski in hotels and pensions .
Consequently , it is always possible to trace chambers free for all dates in winter , including Christmas and the new year .
We have many visits on our website .
Users travel offers , asking prices but dare not commit to reserve for the moment .
And if we call straight away , they ask whether there will be snow or mud at Christmas , " said Martin jandura , exploiting the portal for information spindl.info.
If we want to pass the new year of his dreams to špindlerův mlýn , better no longer too hesitate to reserve .
If we give priority to the economies and that the quality of accommodation only comes next , then we can try to wait a few more days .
Hotel owners of špindler did not propose for the moment that time spent a week for the new year .
I believe that they will try again a time placing them , but they cèderont too and accept shorter periods .
And then the number of free Chambers will quickly reduced , has estimated jandura .
The Agency ingtours tourism also proposes the vrchlabí still beds free for all winter periods .
The week of Christmas interests us most at the moment , it is not completely sold .
It remains free , say , half of chambers in our bid .
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas holidays cheaper , " said the director of ingtours Petr schiefert .
The Agency vrchlabí tourism can also propose new year to krkonoše , but there are fewer places free .
The fourteen days of February leave equally well , the remaining hivernaux stays sell moderately .
This year , the interest in the winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to krkonoše .
People expect that it began to fall .
Nobody wants to spend winter to snowless mountains .
If the avenues overlap during the week , Christmas also be incomplete , " think schiefert .
Conversely , the occupation of the hotel horizont Pec pod sněžkou is slightly higher than last year .
It was an improvement of roughly five per cent .
We have some recent places for the new year as for Christmas .
There is great interest during the holidays of January of Poles and February sells well too , " informed Karel Rada , Director of the best Pec hotel .
Omnia hotel near the Central Park jánské lázně is also complete in eighty per cent during the period of the new year .
On the contrary , half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent lázně jánské hotel .
This year we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January , where we have already Sixty per cent of occupation at present .
February is somewhat lower for now , but as soon as snow will fall , the interest in stays in the krkonoše builds certainly still indicated the director of the hotel Omnia , Erik sporysch .
Hotel owners of krkonoše must not , however , expect more snow .
On Thursday it will fresher and if there is rainfall , they should be neigeuses in the mountains .
But subsequently , time should heating , informed Jiří jakubský Hradec station Czech ( Institute .
United States : repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even amusing , the unceasing effort with which Barack Obama , President the reputation of wise , reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question , that it considered itself as quite simple .
When it was eventually leave perspiration its doctrine if eagerly awaited , it transpired that he had identical to paper carbon since the Bush Iraqi scenario of three years .
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression " as Iraq ' , he did not hesitate , moreover , to use the title of Bush 's speech in January 2007 as part of its own speech : ' a new road forward "
At the same time , he has personally criticised the idea of Bush to send more reinforcement in an Iraq burned by civil war as " irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences . "
The following months have shown , however , that the strategy of Bush , who has emanated from the recommendations commanders campaigns , was the only possible and likely to success to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak at all of Iraq .
This has not improved the reputation of Bush , however , objectively speaking , it has left to his successor a final position much more favourable than we might have hoped .
Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan , the miracle will happen again
It is once again the commanders of campaigns that requested an increase in the military contingent , including the commander of the operation , General Stanley mccristal Afghanistan , which has even severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination .
He asked for 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favourable .
The President has hesitated for three months but lacking a better option , it has at least perhaps feel that the general of 10 000 soldiers .
He managed to root out the promise of 5 000 additional from Europe , even if it were on 10 000 originally .
What causes the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan by 18 months and conclude this whole process within three years ; the whole Obama doctrine brings more questions than it does not provide answers .
Much has doubts about the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq .
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years , Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders honour the agreements .
The Afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no Treaty is respected .
In these conditions , difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces , accustomed to change day-to-day leader according to what suits them .
The political institutions , although based officially , will remain just window-dressing behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations .
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity regarding the reports , which are still complicated by the Pakistani influences and Iran .
Even the foundation of a " state swift to act ' , which is the basic aim of the operation , does not seem to be very real .
The time horizon Obama strategy was perplexed by his resoluteness .
In the past eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has gone from bad to worse and is being on the brink of chaos .
Only a heart purely romantic and outside reality can be confident that small soldiers in the tumult of the war in view of their " speedy return at home ' will bring a miracle .
From a political point of view , setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard as the confession indirect American defeat .
The recent NATO Summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative .
European politicians can neither do not want to explain to their electorate what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains .
Another factor that radically alter the situation is changing events linked to Iran .
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that sanctions strengthened did not affect the Iranians , Americans will be presented with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by military force .
We must respond by example when , according to Obama , America came to the victorious withdrawal of troops to Afghanistan .
Each solution will , however , such a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation .
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still sufficient time so that it is working on a new strategy , in cases where the latter was to be a flop .
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive more premiums cash
Employees top leaders American bank Goldman Sachs will receive more this year premiums in cash .
Society announced to react to sharp criticism of its wage practices .
The group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money , which they cannot sell within five years .
The actions might be withdrawn the leaders in case they would take too risky .
According to Reuters , Goldman Sachs arises so at the forefront of the effort to connect rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street .
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that we must take , indicated the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of society JPMorgan
The concern is in the details , he added .
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $ 17 billion in premiums on the first three months of this year .
For the current year , the total amount of premiums will exceed probably 20 billion dollars in spite of the measure announced today , according to Reuters .
With the arrival of the financial crisis , the banking sector rich premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries .
Britain has announced on Wednesday that it intends to assign a single fee fifty per cent bankers ' bonuses exceeding 25 000 books .
France is preparing similar measures .

The Minister janota intends to resign . Klaus has invited the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard janota , which pondère his visit to the government because of its disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was approved by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of janota cabinet will be on the agenda at their meeting on Friday .
Klaus also criticises the budget .
According to him , the deficit is too important , which is widening the crisis of public finances .
This is the radim ochvat presidential spokesman who informed of the meeting .
Janota then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer .
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signature of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion kronor that the Czech Republic should manage .
Nevertheless , the Chamber of Deputies validated Wednesday , the proposals of the left transfers of money and increased rewards officials , the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers .
The government proposals from the Social Democrats criticized the fact that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit .
For this reason , a violent disagreement was born between left on the one hand , the government , Klaus and right on the other hand , disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer which was formed by agreement between the ODS , the čssd and the Green Party .
Critics allege that the budget , as it was voted by MEPs , removes the package of savings past by the government of Fischer and which must according to him stem the indebtedness of the state .
Klaus , who can ratify the law on state budget but that nothing obliges , stated today at breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs , that policies have long neglected the " serious problem " of the " deficiency irréfrénable " of public finances .
Now there is , according to him , no solution .
Only a strong government could contribute to an improvement , if it could rely on a consensus of broader political parties , according to the President .
The President of ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is appalling and that the government should challenge its future existence .
The vice-chairman of ODS Petr Nečas stated in čtk that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the čssd , ODS and the Greens does more clearly .
In its response , Prime Minister Fischer has described these words ' drastic verdicts . "
The head of the čssd Jiří Paroubek reacted against Topolánek , saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the previous government of Topolánek is appalling and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor .
Wednesday , already , the čssd described successful ratification of the state budget for the next year .
The People 's Party was also satisfied .
Morgan freeman will play Mandela in the new film of clint Eastwood
Despite critical of the fact that the principal roles are played by actors Americans , South Africans allege that the new Hollywood film invictus - unbeaten will address the world a lot about the country , its fighting and its success .
History spoke of sport , relations between races and Nelson Mandela .
Morgan freeman , American player rewarded , embodies the film on the lives of Nelson Mandela , indefatigable fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president .
Freeman said , that it is a Mandela Ninety-one years of age who asked the embody in the film .
Matt Damon plays another important role .
I said to him : ' if I have to embody , I should be able to see you personally ..
The actor aged seventy-two years which has been rewarded for a price for its role in the tragedy milion dollar baby of clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has , for example , incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery become itself slave , a shadow of the US President , and even God in the film Evan almighty but never a yet living and also important for so many people that is Mandela .
The ex-homme of South African state was imprisoned 27 years for its hard work in securing the end of apartheid in South Africa .
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years .
In 1993 it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and that is the title of a poem by author English William Ernest henley published in respect .
The challenge was to speak like him .
The film tells the story real joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country . The newly-elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always racially divided and economically after apartheid .
It is sure to unite its people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among outsiders at global level .
The South African team will eventually make progress in World Cup in 1995 .
Freeman worked a few years to bring the history of Mandela on large screen .
I had no other purpose if not play this role in order to bring the addition of reality , said freeman .
The greatest challenge for me this was , of course , to speak like him
The actor stated that if it and the international politician were in the same region , it would have tried to meet Mandela , dinner with him , to be behind the scenes before his speech .
The most important for him to shake hands .
I realised that when I you hand I should get back to your energy , it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel , he said .
It is important for me to try to become another person .
Matt Damon plays in the film François pienaar , captain of a rugby national team in which there is a majority of players whites .
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the midst of hard rugby .
For him , its first meeting with pienaar at his home was a great surprise .
I remember when I arrived at the door of the House , I opened and the first thing I said to Francois pienaar was : ' I look much greater in the film " .
Despite the differences between actors and real models , invictus under the leadership of the film-maker Eastwood received opinions and positive even talk of ambitions for the Oscars .
The criticism of films Todd McCarthy the Journal daily variety summarised his appreciation in these words : " It is a very good history , a film very well done . "
In evaluations of films on the rottentomatoes.com site , invictus has received 76 per cent of positive comments .
The mystery of the will in Norway is determined : the Russians were trying out a rocket
We have seen a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway .
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic near the Norwegian border .
The launch has yet been a failure and the missile type ' bulava " which was originally set the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
His presence repeated at rocket tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights .
Most of the time , either bulava has not disappeared , or it has damaged in flight .
Newspapers Russians speak of " bulava " as the " missile which do not steals "
A missile which do not steals but that glitters
This 13th test was unfolding at the beginning normally .
It is only at the end of the flight that there was again damage on the apparatus .
This is obviously the engine of the third stage of the fuse that exploded .
This time , " bulava ' has disappeared dmitrij nuclear submarine which donskij journey under the surface of the White Sea .
This type of missile can rightly be set on fire boat immersed in movement and
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely has probably been by a " bulava " flawed .
For the rest , the Norwegians have not doubt for a moment that there is a Russian rocket .
The generals argue that this time we cannot talk utter failure .
The two first floors resisted rocket and the damage affected only the third .
In previous cases , engines have experienced failings on the first stage .
Even if no test launches has happened smoothly , the Ministry of Defence considers that only six on thirteen have been failures .
The success rate of almost fifty per cent therefore encourages generals optimism and they therefore claim always that one day ' bulava " fly without problems and that it will take even ten hypersoniques nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tonnes .

Hyundai has listened to the unions and reverse all overtime
The leadership of the plant Hyundai of nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime .
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that trade unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday .
The spokesperson Petr vaněk factory Hyundai confirmed .
The direction is , however , still reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year .
We cannot renounce our plan of production , it is essential , and that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on 19 December knowing that there would be two teams , stated vaněk .
The site sedmička.cz indicated that society has proposed a bonus CZK 400 to employees who would be part of the team of Saturday .
It is also a reactive attributed to the day worked on 28 November .
Society , according to vaněk , decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime .
Either they receive the supplement to the hours , in addition , be they can pose a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their holidays aindiqué vaněk .
In addition to that all employees present on Saturday , will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch .
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent issue and the warmer in the comments and the claims of trade unions and employees who have ceased spontaneously production last week , management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime in the month of December , stated vaněk .
Until last week , employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two overtime in addition to their eight hours .
The trade unions are cancel the strike after signature of the agreement .
Following negotiation between the management of the car factory and trade unions should take place on Friday afternoon .

Czech discovery : a substance which operates on the HIV virus " hard-working people " also
A team of scientists Czechs and Germans testing new combinations which can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the body .
The main advantage of the substance improved is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed a immunity to medicines .
This reality sometimes takes precedence over the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on the current variants of the virus , as well as certain medicines already available .
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present .
Nevertheless , we can extend radically the lives of patients via a mixture of medicines that are preventing the spread of the HIV virus in the body .
Their consumption entails however a series of side effects .
Moreover the suppression of this increase is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which medication no longer have any effect .
The work of experts of three institutions , the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic , the všcht of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to confront HIV resistance .
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes acting on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus .
The metalocarboranes are a concoction of boron , hydrogen , cobalt and carbon .
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used until now , and this is why they could overcome the problem of resistance .
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances ' improved ' , on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanical their connections virus proteins .
The metalocarboranes have a single impacted : two cages at many walls are trained by atoms of hydrogen boron , and carbon and linked by an atom metal , in this case cobalt .
A virus traitor and resilient .
The HIV protease is a protein the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus .
Without the division of the HIV virus protease caused by the HIV there would be no birth mature infectious particles of the virus .
If we stop the protease of HIV , there also stop the spread of the virus into the body of the patient , explain researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry Academy of Sciences the Czech Republic .
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of medicinal chemistry , scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cage ( see table ) are connected by a short organic link , which is then systematically amended .
Somewhat lower but more reliable .
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases HIV has been tested in test tubes and on its variants resistant , obtained from patients infected with HIV .
On the current version of the enzyme , the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on medicines clinics , however it is not diminishing on the versions resilient against which the current medicines are often inefficient .
The metalocarboranes , with their single action mechanism and their other properties as their stability of biological and chemical weapons , low toxicity and the possibility of other amendments are therefore chemical compounds worth considering more to move towards the development of effective medicines against HIV , asserts pavlína řezáčová , Director of the structural Biology Laboratory Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences .
Dispute surrounding the budget . ODS denigrates Fischer , who defends
President of the Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) , Mirek Topolánek has described " staggering " the budget for the following year and ratified according to him , the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence .
The Prime Minister has described what ODS of drastic verdict .
He said take time to analyse .
The spokesman of ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the čssd , ODS and the Green Party is obviously more .
According to Nečas , the head of government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares for combating the growing deficit , or if it is to remain in office with the assistance of the parliamentary left .
Nečas has warns that the positions of the Social Democrats and the ODS compared to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed .
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday , the budget for the year 2010 , however with the proposed changes to the tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left .
The House has increased the money for the salaries of officials , the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers .
The claim of government to the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit .
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor .
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote , obeying the wishes of the government and as an amended budget is a variant least bad as a budget .
Disappointment and uselessness
The Finance Minister Eduard janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of helplessness , Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government will give further consideration to the current situation .
Nečas is convinced that if janota threatened to leave office when ratification of the proposed changes , the situation would be different .
According to Czech TV , janota Monday took rendezvous with Prime Minister after its passage through government :
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if it would remain in office .
Its disappointment at the negotiations on the budget is the reason .
If Fischer decides to continue to combat the budget deficit , Nečas believes that the representatives of čssd , who pushed the changes of the budget , do not have their place in the government .
The Prime Minister should also make clear that it will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting health insurance , pensions , or the reform of the law on services .
Topolánek : ministers appointed by the ODS are not under threat .
This is the case of head of government Fischer and all the government .
Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing to detrimental , stressed Topolánek in a communiqué textually since the United States .
He recalled that the Deputy Ministers of some ministries embraced top 09 , who voted against the budget .
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of conducting a fight against the amount of the fiscal deficit , " it is completely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority who is currently in the Chamber . '
That said , it must not expect the support and tolerance democrats .
I did not thoughtful and once it will be on the agenda , then I will dedicate said from the Chamber to journalists , Defense Minister Martin barták , elected government precisely by the democrats .
Prime Minister Fischer has been kicked out in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels .
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister .
Nečas stressed at the same time as the ODS Wednesday would probably have voted against the amended budget if it had not specifically asked the democratic parliamentarians to allow the vote on the budget .
We did not feel orphans , there is no small children , he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticised by the President of the party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget .
I have not noticed that my vote should have been lacking .
I knew already when I have renounced my mandate that what will follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation of the Chamber and destroying everything there is positive , reacted Topolánek in person .
According to the new timetable for the čd there will be fewer trains for the same charges .
The Czech railways will delete or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and instead would increase some others .
The full coverage of transport will decline to date of entry into force of the new timetable of two per cent compared to today .
Most of the charges will not change , including basic tariffs and the reduced cost .
One example is the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava which will more connections to the capital , the railways will add a train set pendolino .

Two night trains on the line Prague - tábor - České budějovice - are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - písek - České budějovice - will amount to only a few days in the week .
Among the greatest changes , we can see the introduction of a new milovice direct line in Prague : at the moment the inhabitants of milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem .
It is the fifteenth line of suburban system Esko , whose openness is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and milovice .
The distant lines to the capital will their final destination at the station main of Prague ( praha hlavní nádraží ) .
The čd will introduce more lines CS pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to šumperk / jeseník travel at intervals of two hours .
Passengers can no longer take the pendolino until Bratislava as of 13 December .
This year the invoice for regional railways : 200 million additional SEK .
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of transport and will contribute to the railways next year in all four billion kronor to resolve the losses visible , the same amount as this year . Commuter services are ordered by the regions who will pay for their by a total eight billion next year , knowing that the state will participate worth almost three billion .
This year commuter services are 200 million more expensive .
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years , until now the time was always a year .
The railways appreciates the system , which also explains that they do not have resorted to an increase in the price of the vast majority of transport .
The changes will affect only the net čd one-day banknotes and coins Internet at reduced prices eliška .
For travellers without reduction card , the price of čd net increase of 450 to SEK 600 .
The price of eliška newly depend on the journey will come , whereas previously it was valid between cities from one region to the choice and was a single tariff of 160 kronor .

The film contains great expectations as it was presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in the middle of preparations for the football World Cup , and secondly because the media are being shaken by new worrying about the increase of racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the share of the black majority in power .
According to the Agency APS , reactions to the new film are rather positive for the moment in South Africa , despite the frequent reservations towards key roles where " pavanent " Hollywood stars .
Morgan freeman is nevertheless , taking its own words , proud of the film .
I dreamt that role of long years and I am well prepared .
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy , he said during the first official of the film in Los Angeles .
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film The personality and the message of Mandela .
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa , but it is a matter for each individual he added .
Bringing the national team swimming rugby
The film based on the history of the British writer , John carlin heading freely translated . In the role of the enemy : Nelson Mandela and the coin which gave its inception the people portrays the African defender of human rights during his mandate to the Presidency .
Morgan freeman is therefore trying during the film of picking up two races of a population long divided and even that Nelson Mandela , dressed in 1995 it between the national team swimming South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup , that South Africa has won then .
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey , which is seen in South Africa as something sacred , Mandela had been extensively ovationné fourteen years public mainly White and has been recognized by the white populations .
Let us hope that the football championship will succeed in uniting people again in a single nation , indicated the rugby player Chester Williams , who was in 1995 only ' black ' of the national team .
It remains to be seen whether the situation of South Africa tense will improve .
White South Africans are however sceptical as was recently given in an interview for ln Christopher dawson , fan of rugby who had fled to Britain .
The championship starts on 11 June 2010 .

Jančura will complain for libel against three prefects of čssd
Radim jančura owner of student agency , will put forward today defamation complaint against three prefects social democrats .
And practically combat Michal Soldier Švejk ’ of the region of South Moravia , against Radko martínka pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of olomouc Martin tesařík .
Jančura indicated in dvacet UNMIT of radiožurnál .
The complaint is linked to the attempt to exploit society regional railways in certain regions .
All regions have however eventually sign of long-term contracts with the Czech railways .
All three we attacked and say that we made fine mouths , although there is only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves .
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways which were signed last week .
Therefore we have to defend ourselves .
It is in exchange slanders on society student agency , stated jančura in radiožurnál .
Likewise , he indicated have evidence that no region has taken in line with European law .
We are preparing for this a complaint to the European Commission .
The Good Soldier Švejk ’ considers the lodging of complaints by Mr jančura represents the continuation of a media spectacle that serve as its free publicity for its society and for his person .
I am of course prepared to defend my behalf and on behalf of my region and I call upon the other prefects to do likewise .
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr jančura who manipulates public opinion and is using false and mendacious arguments about regional rail transport , declare Soldier Švejk ’
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in advertising that is worth mentioning the unfavourable regions approaches .
He said to radiožurnál he stopped the campaign after Christmas and that it expects the resume after the new year .
He said that the campaign will corruption in the broad sense .
Jančura began its campaign after the regions had agreed to entrust the Czech railways exploitation of rail links for a control of approximately 150 billion kronor without submitting tenders .
According to jančura , such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice .
According to him , his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to jančura threats of a Member of čssd .
The only threat has been that if we did not cease , we might lose our bus licences .
He presented himself as a Member of čssd , I do not know what it is , but I will not say his name , stated jančura today to radiožurnál .
Pneumococcal infection vaccination will be free and voluntary
Vaccination against the pneumococcal infection renversera old habits as early as January .
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families .
Already , some voices saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective .
The preparations for the introduction of vaccination against the free pneumococcal infection peak .
The pharmaceutical Institute for vaccines already defines maximum prices that will pay the insurances .
Specialists are also clear in the process of vaccination .
A new vaccination .
Vaccines free for children of August .
Since January , children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against the free pneumococcal infection .
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated .
If we began vaccination last year or earlier , it should pay oneself following vaccinations .
The first dose of vaccines must be administered between the third and the 5th month of the child .
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily pneumococcal infection vaccinated its children .
Yet 1600 parents pay SEK even more to a dose .
The vaccination of younger requires four doses .
Experts consider each year Health insurances spend SEK 300 to 450,000 in doses of vaccine .
They save however on medical care that children non-vaccinated would require .
So far the state spends approximately SEK 500,000 per year for any child vaccination .
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the ' package janota " .
The pneumococcal infection are the cause of inflammation of the ear average but also serious infections which put inflammation of blood and poisoning .
According to surveys in hospitals , there has until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections of pneumococcal infection .
Apart from the Czech Republic , approximately 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid .
Vaccination be compulsory ?
There are opinions concerning any obligation of vaccination in future .
From January , it must be resolved by insurance and optional .
For example , President of the association nahlas Rudolf kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive .
His association promotes long vaccination against the pneumococcal infection .
At an international conference in which our association participated , specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a vaccination optional .
It is not ideal .
On the other hand , we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this .
I think that is a direction that we now need to follow stated kalovský .
But the Ministry of Health does not amend the process of vaccination against the pneumococcal infection .
We are definitely not for the moment , declared its spokesperson vlastimil sršeň .
Vaccination optional has its drawbacks , say doctors .
Hana cabrnochová , President of the company specialized paediatricians , recognizes that a vaccination based on the volontariata defect-free .
If all children were vaccinated , one could envisage a decline of renewals vaccinations " in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional " said however cabrnochová .
The experts predict that from next year , more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their babies .
Vaccination against the pneumococcal infection marks a break also the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is financed by the assurances and not the state .
Cabrnochová explains that the assurances should release funds for the prevention , they économiseraient so on possible future medical care .
Doctors will buy their products themselves
However , this is linked to the worries of paediatricians practitioners , concerning the purchase of vaccines .
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance doctors receiving in the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state .
Some MEPs are afraid , however , that this will enable assurances of " deduct the sums of health insurance " .
Thus , doctors should buy the products and wait for insurance reimburse them .
According to estimates , paediatricians must individually invest nearly 40 000 Crowns per month in vaccines , which is a significant sum .
It will not be easy , according to cabrnochová .

Islam can be English ?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
Roger bootle Deloitte
Some people will be attracted to this new book admirers of the latest book the author , " why the French do not like headscarves " ( 2006 ) , a study elegant and well documented on a problem which has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today .
The latest book by Mr bowen presents a much wider fabric and more ambitious .
Good anthropologist , it not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say on Islam in France , but what is happening in the country .
He spent many months in mosques , schools and institutions that provide welcomes this now in France . Bozen calls " Muslim spaces ' for the 5m-6m Muslims .
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and pupils on matters which affect them most .
A Muslim to marry in a mosque or town hall ( or both ) ?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims ?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim ?
Could a Muslim use a banking system based on interest to obtain a loan ?
These are practical problems , he says , who are the daily lot , rather than the political tragedies which concern the media .
The author identifies a new generation of imams , teachers and intellectuals , all unknown to the general public , except perhaps Tariq Ramadan , a Muslim Arabic born in Switzerland .
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society .
They do not push the debate until the end .
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam .
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr bowen are usually in agreement with their counterparts lawyers a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which nowadays , constitute a small part of Muslims in Europe .
M bowen believes that the values of Muslims and secularism French could be compatible .
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each camp .
He wondered how French politicians ( and the intellectual elite guardian if muscle-flexing secularism ) are genuinely committed to pluralism .
According to him , Muslims have not been spoiled , compared to Catholics , Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises history with the secular republicanism .
Rather than a growing pragmatism , it discovers a " narrowness of key values ' .
Islam can be English ? After reading of this book , one is tempted to say ' yes , but not yet . "
The view the darkest days of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than anywhere else on the planet .
That includes the ice is melting at an alarming rate , taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere .
Oil , gas , shipments and fishing roam new waters opened up , with diplomats , lawyers and now writers in their wake .
In a " on thin ice sheet " , Richard Ellis , painted a writer and illustrator natural history , the symbol of the far north , polar bears .
Connoisseur history and complicated policies of whaling , it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers basing their evidence in driving the bear white .
The meeting of Admiral Nelson , then courageous aspiring to 14 years which had to fight the tip of its mousquet , is certainly a myth , but the rest is true .
Young people oursons caught when they nageaient alongside their mother , just killed , were caught and sent in zoos and circuses .
At the beginning of the twentieth century , a spectacle famous brought together 75 bear simultaneously .
Even today , the dimensions of a zoo are always usually a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in liberté. climate is rarely mentioned : a polar bear living in Singapore became Green because of algae that led in its thick fur .

Mr Ellis tells the story of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species .
Although prohibited in Norway , America and Russia , the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters helicopter Inuit and Indians in motoski use fusilsd' onslaught powerful to oust their game .
Ironically , it is in the waters most North of these two nations hunting that the ice will remain the longest .
In his new book " after the ice ' , alun Anderson , a former editor-in-chief of new scientist , provides a clear summary and frightening science of the Arctic and a breathtaking overview of what may be the future there .
Not that scientists have all the answers .
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers cannot tell exactly the speed of change .
This is not due to try .
Late nineteenth and early twentieth , travel pioneers of inter-balkan relations gave the initial information on the melting of the ice sheet .
The submarines in the cold war were then mapped changes of relief sous-celle-ci .
Satellite surveillance probes placed on the icebergs are of great help , but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened , camping in the cold .
Mr Anderson looking at the world extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice , formed by the clutches of brackish water pressured by freezing .
But the bear mentioned above the marvels microscopic contained in ice , everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice of been scheduled between 2013 and 2050 .

All activities , including protests supposedly groundbreaking moderate critical and writings , entail Braving arrest .
The anti-gouvernementaux graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes .
Cuba has a if Community increasingly large , led by yoani Sánchez , commentatrice often written popular on how are husband and it are monitored and harassed by government agents .
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorisations have always been refused .
The detention of an American citizen will possibly increase tensions between the Communist government brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a " soft " approach to improve relations with the island .
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times , Friday night .
The new American policy insists that the Cuban Government advance by practical steps , such as release political prisoners and to create more space for the opposition , so that the US might to reciprocate .
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba , albeit consumer goods new desired and in a country or the average salary of an official was $ 15 per month .
Only this year , the Cuban Government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones ; they are mainly used for SMS or for a conversation of 15 minutes which corresponds to a day of salary .
On the island , Internet use is extremely limited .
It is available in the luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country , as well as in some government buildings , such as universities .

The Pakistani authorities prevented a conspiracy to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday , the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men of Virginia northern Afghanistan in order to kill American troops , saying that they hoped that this matter would dismantle an important network recruitment of terrorists scouring Internet in search of young men radicalized .
Investigators have claimed that they have always fished for a living insurgente personality hidden , known as saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when a Member commented approving the waves terrorists on YouTube video website on the Internet .
Arrived in Pakistan , these men were guided by saifullah which tried to help them to join the remote region tribal belt of Pakistan , home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps .
But a representative of Pakistani secret services which has been informed of the case had said Saturday that saifullah failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network .
They have been isolated for days in the eastern town of sargodha , far north-east prohibited mountain become a haven of terrorism .
They were considered undercover agents .
That is why they were rejected , declared a representative of the authorities who spoke to the status of anonymity because the confidential nature of the case .
The representative of the authorities asserted that men were determined and they tried still to obtain licences for entry into the camps of Al-Qaida when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law .
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI -- stress the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly , in the determination of those who give its confidence .
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the American secret services have prioritized to infiltrate men in the Al-Qaida network .
The organization recruiters play the role of gardes-barrières , refuse access to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove spies .
Analysts , potential American recruits are considered carefully by Al Qaeda .
But they are also very appealing to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire .
However Evan kohlmann , expert nefa foundation based in the United States , declared that terrorist groups must also do more and more attention , in recent years in the choice of people that they accept because the US secret services have become experts as regards their recruitment methods .
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups , what better way than to follow its model of recruitment which so many people have already said . Kohlmann monitoring ?
The model is increasingly on the Internet .
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen claim a " action " for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have marched in the streets , here , on Saturday , calling for a greater action on climate on the part of the negotiators working in the Palacio bella Convention center of the city .
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100 000 people , but 25 000 according to estimates by the police .
This event has proceeded relatively peacefully , although a few veiled activists has lit a few near a set of government buildings , in centre- city .
On the day that little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsorisées by the United Nations , thousands of activists walked around the city , deploying placards in English saying ' there is no planet B " and a Spanish saying " the land said that she has had enough ' .
Several celebrities joined the protests , including the top model and Danish photographer Helena Christensen , who said that travel to the homeland of his mother , Peru , has opened our eyes to the agonizing problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that are already taking place . "
That is one of the reasons why I have decided to join the great March -- to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions , ambitious and incurred , she said .
This is not an easy task , but it must be undertaken , it is no longer possible to avoid it .
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too about the Centre bella and has said that she had arrested 19 people on the ground wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives .
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too about the Centre bella and has said that she had arrested 19 people on the ground wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives .
According to one passer-by who asked anonymity because of its involvement in discussions on the climate , the activists who were wearing masks and black clothes , sparked several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen , which is surrounded by some ministries .
They were throwing nearly buildings , he said , adding that they were first rockets , followed by " some large ' explosions .
Within the Convention , people were collected on television screens to monitor the way throughout the afternoon .
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to reawaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei , representative of China on climate .
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on the international deliberations , he responded in English ' indeed , this is something I did not realize it .
He then continued Mandarin , saying ' The event is important , I cannot hear what happens outside ' .
He observed that the March could seem noxious or useful perspective .
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors on the subject of climate change , he said .
On the other hand , ' you can also say that they disturb negotiations or they are damaging the freedom of others . "
The results of tests show deep-rooted differences between races
The federal report of last week on the results in mathematics has made a good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district is still far behind establishments in mind , the report shows that the rank 4 and rank 5 ( cm1-cm2 ) are far greater progress during the previous two years that in cities such as Atlanta , Chicago and New York .
But what is clear from the latest figures from the national assessment of educational progress ( national evaluation of progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white , both local and national level .
The results means white children class 4 ( cm1 ) to washingtond.c. increased over the past two years , 262 to 270 ( on a scale of 500 ) , but those of their classmates African-American grew by only three points , 209 to 212 .
The gap of success has in fact increased between 2007 and 2009 , from 53 to 58 points .
The progress of African-Americans in rank 8 ( 4 ) remains constant generally , just one point , 245 to 244 .
The average score whites , has not been included in the results of tests because the specimen was not sufficiently important .
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging .
In 2003 , the gap between blacks and whites in class of rank 4 ( cm1 ) , when the first report was published , naep district was 60 points ( 262 to 202 ) .
Although the results of children in both groups have increased during this period , the difference has just reduced to 58 points .
Last week , some defenders in the district expressed the concern that rising celebrated by the director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. rhee and the mayor , Adrian Mr fenty ( Democrat ) were run by white students who were already good elements .
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in recognizing the elements at the top of the scale , which is problematic and embarrassing , said Jeff Smith , Director of D.C. voice , a non-profit group which defends equality in education district .
I do not jumping for joy for one or two points won , stated Kwame R. Brown ( related Democrat ) , Member of the board of D.C. and whose daughter is in rank 4 , to Eaton elementary ( elementary school ) .
Often criticism of the style of management of rhee , Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools ( colleges ) of the city desperately need attention .
Really , you will always see the positive signs and I respect that .
But what is fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our Middle schools ( colleges ) .
Rhee stated that the district should continue to find better ways of meeting the needs of the students in difficulty .
This autumn , for example , some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading , the Wilson reading system , aimed schoolchildren for upper classes elementary and early College who did not incorporate the foundations of the reading earlier at school and who are quite far behind with their peers .
Every day , the programme of mathematics , for classes of kindergarten ( nursery ) to rank 6 ( 6th ) highlights the Games and the experiences of real life , as they have been established in the district by the former head clifford janey , which must also be credited to the progress of the naep reported last week .
I simply believe that we must continue to work to offer better interventions to these pupils to lower level than class , has said rhee .
Others argue that the results of the naep raise the question of whether rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap .
That is a dilemma for Michelle rhee , said Bruce fuller , one trainer education at the University of California at Berkeley analyses the results of tests for cities .
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and your management reforms to schools located in the poorer areas of Washington .
Also this targeting can have repercussions policies affecting this important programme .
But the problem , of course , is that , like other superintendent brought schools , it is trying to use the middle class of white and black .
We focus for the development of a system of good schools .
We must strengthen our schools of neighbourhoods in order that all families , no matter where they come from , should be confident that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education .
Now , janey schools superintendent brought Newark , stated in an interview this week , that one of the essential elements to narrow the gap of success étaitla duration of traditional public school today of 180 days in the district of Washington , to be in competition with the charter schools .
We must obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change , has said janey , who came to an agreement with the Union of its teachers last year to obtain 185 days , that it considers a ' starting point ' to achieve an increase in the next contract .
Make higher education a promise for the future
The bus was arrested in gettysburg College with a long sifflement .
Graciela Rodriguez , 12 years , equal and cligne a time of eyes in view of columns White , facades of bricks and leafy grasslands .
Parents of graciela had only able to finish high school , àel Salvador .
Until recently , graciela itself , who was born in silver spring and lives in riverdale , had never set foot in a university campus .
Also , while it and other students of rank 8 ( 4 ) of the group have explored gettysburg where fees are of $ 38 690 per year , his attitude was less than a new student impressed that enthusiastic .
This is where I shall study super ! has exclamée graciela who would like to study medicine , whereas the guide the heading toward the entry of the building of science .
Youpi , really ? hear food for thought , when it was noted the low ratio professor of law - student .
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had fully integrated the message : the question is not whether you are going to university :
The question is where .
Although this issue is still widely for the large number of American children born of immigrant parents Hispanics who left school where have become parents adolescence , they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education which will allow them to enter the middle class .
Indeed , " a Hispanic of the ' second generation ' on cinqpoursuit his studies at grammar -- a notable success if one considers that both of their parents immigrants , most Mexico and Central America , came to us without having ended Lyceum .
Their success is important , they open the way to future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country .
Researchers studying the battants claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed .
Many also whose parents set high targets for their children and find ways of compensating for their lack of familiarity with American schools .
The mentoring also play a very important role in helping graciela and millions of children as it to arrive until the university -- especially , if its efforts are regular and in the long term .
When you look at children low-income families with parents who did not experience and expertise to help them to navigate through the system , any intervention , at any time , does not help them , said Patricia gándara , researcher Davis , University of California , who has studied the Latin American students .
We must think to offer a network of support for those children , nursery to school .

The Ministry of Iraqi oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns on violence and political instability , the Iraqi Government has managed to attract large oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two eras that have ended on Saturday .
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China , Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry to Iraq , invalidated by decades of civil war and sanctions .
American companies are left with a participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned .
Seven corporations had paid to participate in the second era which began on Friday .
The only who had put an auction has lost .
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June .
The representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts .
Iraq has finally opened its doors , after six years of war , and instead of US companies are European and Asian companies which pave the way , stated ruba husari , the editor of the forum Iraq oil forum , a site of information on the Internet .
It will be a long time before another offer was made in Iraq .
The concerns on security , corroborated by massive bombing coordinated , Tuesday , and political instability while American military troops withdraw have hampered the American oil companies , preventing them from enter more forcefully in Iraq who owns the third largest oil reserve of gross world , say analysts .
American companies were , in some cases , disadvantaged because of their rivals , especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government whose labour costs were significantly lower and that were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders .
Exxon-mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry .
The most important American companies , such as Chevron and conocophillips , who have spoken stronger links with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and provided their technical advice , are left empty-handed .
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom have been the two main shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend .
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. , owned by the State , has more enchéri on contracts that other companies and left with substantial ownership in contracts for two main fields .
We all know that China is becoming a major economy , as well as a technological power , stated Assam Jihad , spokesman for the Ministry of oil .
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and achieves its commitments in Iraq .
Pré-sélectionnées societies to submit auctions have made offers which have then been compared with the cost per barrel that the Ministry agreed to pay for motivating production above current levels for each field .
One of the main organisers of Al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile , having struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed an organizer of operations of Al Qaeda , this week , stated on Friday of the American authorities .
If information is confirmed , this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn .
Al-somali Saleh was one of the two men Arabs suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their cars , Tuesday , near the town of miran Shah , in the province of North Waziristan , according to US sources and the Pakistani authorities in the region .
Local authorities have stated that the missiles by an unmanned air of the type used by the CIA , inside the anarchic tribal border of Pakistan .
They drove a car White , heading towards the Afghan border , where the car was struck , declared a Member of the secret services civilians Pakistanis , speaking on the phone to miran Shah .
Representatives of the Authority have stated that the activists suspects rushed to place and were quickly confiscated what remained totally scattered ' body ' .
It was completely impossible to local authorities to check the identity of the victims , but the two representatives antiterrorist Americans gave evidence not specified that Somali was part of the dead .
Somali was described as one of the officials military organizers who led the al-Qaeda terrorist operations group Afghan-Pakistani outside the region .
Its role is to organize conspiracies worldwide , stated one of the authorities who sought anonymity , citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside the territory of Pakistan .
Given its central role , this probably included conspiracies attacks against the US and Europe .
It has followed the strategic guidelines al-Qaeda leaders and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks .
A second representative of the American authority stated that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-qaida' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region .
It is perhaps not public awareness of American , but that does not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies , said the second official representative .
If his death is confirmed , Somali would be the second feature of Al-Qaida or the second leader Taliban killed since September , when a similar attack has killed najmuddin jalolov , leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt , together with three other operators .
The pace of the attacks carried out by the CIA drones has declined since the summer , operations by approximately six months to two , according to the figures that the long war journal , a website tempered by a non-profit group .
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability , while killing also ruthlessly informers suspected , asserts the site .
The UN special envoy in Kabul withdrew
The UN special envoy in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , stated on Friday that he would resign in March , at the end of a term tumultuous marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations .
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30 000 additional troops in Afghanistan .
The UN envoy has said that he supported this increase but it has expressed its concern regarding the calendar of us for a withdrawal of troops starting in 18 months and which would oblige the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces .
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan , send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community , stated Eide in a telephone conversation of Kabul .
Our commitment must be long-term .
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan .
The military increase must be copied by civilians , he said .
Eide said that he did not resignation but simply that it would respect its commitment to his family , in March , not to spend two years in Kabul .
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations .
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement .
I simply said that it would be better to start looking for my replacing , said Eide .
When I came here , there was a vacuum of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival .
According to the representatives of the United Nations , Ban has already begun to seek a replacement .
Representatives allege that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted ; it is a italo-suisse citizen who has recently chaired a UN mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno , a Frenchman who has previously led peacekeeping operations of the United Nations .
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after its former deputy , Peter W. Galbraith , had accused , in September , to encourage President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and conceal evidence of a mass electoral fraud .
Eide denied these allegations but stated that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- " have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of éléctions " .
Eide stated that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan .
It has also stressed to UN officials to permit his successor to employ more staff from the United States and other Western countries than it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan , saying that this would give them greater confidence on how their money is spent .
Eide expressed frustration concerning the limits of its powers in Afghanistan , saying that the harsh UN employment regulations were its opportunities to make new talent .
The United Nations rules are such that I was unable to recruit only one person since May , he said .
It is catastrophic and it cannot continue .
Gates : Iran must undergo further sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert Mr. Gates stated on Friday that world-rank powers will soon impose " significant " additional sanctions on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions .
Gates , speaking before a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq , during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , a dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic .
There is no good option in Iran , he said , in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of reniec such an outcome .
One of the things that I burdens most , is that if I have learnt one thing in Iraq over the last six years , it is the side unpredictable inherent in the war .
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions targeting the political and military elite of Iran , but gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians to the streets .
He said that a ' together motivations and punishments " could be necessary to persuade the Iranian Government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons ' because " his people would suffer greatly ' of these sanctions .
On Friday , in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House , Robert gibbs , the administration has joined the EU leaders in warning that Iran will face the consequences ' probable ' if it did not back its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for peaceful purposes .
In the Geneva talks , on 1 October , it has indicated that it will resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of its uranium enrichment storage , in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor .
The administration has prompted such an agreement as a means to develop a confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations .
Since then , Iran appears to be removed from the attempts of understanding - partly , according to the experts , because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact to engage with the US .
Frankly , in my view , the inflexibility of Iran with regard to certain proposals from the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement at the beginning of October , prompted the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , to merge on what they had not envisaged , in terms of substantial additional sanctions against Iranians , stated gates .
President Obama has set on 31 December as deadline to Iran to deal with proposals , before he moves towards other options , including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called ' increased sanctions ' .
In a statement on Thursday at New York , the mission to Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls ' unfounded allegations " of some Members of the Security Council on Iran 's nuclear activities and said it was agreed to continue talks with the US and other five major world powers , " in order to achieve a satisfactory solution in the long term .
Gates , which should go to Washington , met the late on Friday morning , the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , before flying to the oil rich part of Kurdish leaders in order derencontrer troops to Kirkuk , Kurdish and Irbil .
Tensions remain between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq , particularly concerning the borders , property rights and the sharing of income .
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays American plans for reducing the number of American troops , 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of the month of August .
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal pending . The American authorities have cited gates saying to Massoud Barzani , President of the Kurdish regional government : " We will preserve your security , your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq ' .
We will not abandon you . '
In China , a change of direction ageing
Wang weijia and her husband have grown surrounded poster preaching to the propaganda , " mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children ' and ' a baby in most is a graveyard in more " .
So they have learned the lesson that government authorities of Shanghai , alarmed by the low birth rate of their town and by the ageing of the population , have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child ; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm : ever .
We have already given all our time and energy to one child .
We have no second , said Wang , 31 years , Director of human resources and which has a son of 8 months .
More than 30 years after the introduction of its one-child policy in China , creating two generations of children with good cheeks notoriously unique and spoiled , dubbed the " emperor " , a small population crisis threatens the country .
According to the UN , the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented .
The distribution of the population , whereas it is envisaged that the number of residents of 60 years and more blow up , 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 31.1 % in 2050 . This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 % .
This imbalance is even worse in urban rich coastal having a highly educated population , such as Shanghai .
Last year , people aged 60 and over represented approximately 22 % of the population of recorded residents in Shanghai , whereas the birth-rate was less of a child per couple .
Xie lingli , Director of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning Commission municipal population of Shanghai and family planning ) stated that should have fertile couples babies to ' help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labour in the future ' .
Shanghai is on the point of becoming " as old - but not so rich , however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden ' she said .
A gradual reduction
Written in the country 's constitution in 1978 , China 's policy is to date , undoubtedly , the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government .
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay fines enormous -- until three times their annual income -- and discriminated against in the workplace .
The Chinese authorities have conferred on police duty-bound to help the country to avoid a dangerous tendency to its natural resources , while the human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy .
In rural areas , some representatives of the Authority have forced pregnant women of a second child to have abortions .
Moreover , many couples resorted to selective abortion leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high .
In recent years , the responsible authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on its one-child policy .
In 2004 , they paid more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities , members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007 , they have softened much of their slogans hard .
Qiao xiaochun , professor at the Institute of population research ( population research institute ) , at Beijing University , stated that the authorities of the central government recently discussed even more radical changes , such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child .
In July , Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births .
In a short period of time , the posters encouraging families to have a single child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how do the request for authorisation .
The government of the city has dispatched accountable for family planning and volunteers to meet couples , at home , and slipping leaflets under their door .
He has also promised to provide financial and psychological counselling for those who wish to have more than one child .
According to the head of family planning , the response has been disappointing .
Disappointing reply
Although those responsible in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for cases of couples willing to a second child after the launch of the campaign , the district more urban reported that there was no change .
The commune of huinan , with a population of 115 000 inhabitants , for example , is still that four to five applications per month .
Those responsible of Shanghai , disappointed , say that despite the campaign , the number of births in the city , in 2010 , is still expected to be about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008 .
Feng juying , responsible for the Committee for family planning in the municipality of caolu of Shanghai , stated that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children .
They want to fill their first child , she said .
Yang jiawei , 27 years and his wife , Liu juanjuan , 26 years , have stated that they adoreraient have two children and they are legally permitted .
But as many Chinese citizens , they have only minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government .
Without social protection , they say , the decision would be irresponsible .
Westerners mistakenly see that its one-child policy is a problem of rights , stated Yang , an engineer in construction whose seven months pregnant woman is the first child marriages .
It is true , we steals the chance to have more than one child .
But the problem is not only the law .
It is money .
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation .
Wang , human resource manager , has said that she wanted that a single child because it was a itself . " we were the centre of the family and were used that everyone deals with us . "
We are not used to care for someone else , and we really do not want to care for others . "
Chen zijian , 42 years and owner of a society of translation says more bluntly .
For couples working in two , middle-class , which depress the birth rate , he says , it must be selfish pourbien succeed .
People of 20 or 30 years watching their parents grew in fighting in the early stages of the capitalist China and do not want to have themselves this lifestyle , he says .
Even one child time-consuming parent , he says .
A mother must abandon at least two years of its social life .
Then there are the problems of space -- " you need to amend your apartment " -- and planning -- " when your child is only 9 months , you must write her CV to obtain a place in the best kindergarten . "
Most of its friends are ready to this experience once said Chen , but not two .
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living , he says .
We do not want to make too many sacrifices .
The United Nations Group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference , sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by postings disorganized and mutual recriminations -- has returned in the limelight Friday , owing to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases in the next 40 years , with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden , in the coming years .
The text which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases , stressed the remaining obstacles , as much as he has informed the path to take .
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time , with more than 100 leaders worldwide arriving next week in Copenhagen .
Written by an ad hoc working group of the United Nations , the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to withstand global warming , long-term and existing .
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues , including how the advanced economies and emerging economies new could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that those responsible are willing to tolerate .
It gives flexibility to the process , has said , àwashington Representative John coequyt Sierra club .
Michael Zammit wished , who has drafted six pages of document , considered a text of negotiations of 180 pages to concentrate on what has described the Secretary-General executive on climate change , yvo de Boer , as ' the full picture " .
It shows the guidelines to an agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 , of 25 to 45 % compared to 1990 levels , while the main developing countries , during the same period , would reduce emissions by 15 % to 30 % .
Together , the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 % by 2050 .
The European Union has also revived the negotiations , on Friday , promising to provide $ 3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation .
However , on Friday , the same arguments have occurred , who have dominated the negotiations since last week .
Todd Stern , representative of the United States to the negotiation climate has rejected any discussion obliging the reduction of greenhouse gases by the industrialised countries , in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the main emerging economies , if they were not financed by developed countries .
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder towards China that the Bush administration has been two years ago .
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries , said Stern which also regretted that the text does not place sufficient emphasis to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers .
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister , he yafei has stated that the American chief negotiator , or lack of " common sense , " or " extremely irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the US does not help financially China to combat global warming .
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake , defects are emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies .
The current battle relate more to the rescue of individual economies that saving the planet , with China and the US will querellant on their respective obligations while the poorest countries insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the imperatives of scientific act more courageously .
Ricardo ulate , a representative of Costa Rica , stated that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases , although vulnerable countries became more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions .
It really is a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony , has said ulate , who is also advise on the climate for Mexico and Central America for conservation international .
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change they will continue to put pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty , in Copenhagen , although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum , to a political agreement .
The alliance of small island states which unites 43 members , has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages , early Friday morning .
Artur runge-metzger , head of unit climate of the European Commission , has said that the action of small island states has " put political pressure on the entire political process " , partly by what they are now unified and they demanded of emerging economies such as China and India , to act .
The discussions have become a matter of urgency , whereas delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems pending before the heads of governments have come to an agreement .
High-level officials such as the Minister of the environment , jairam ramesh Indian and Chinese Vice-Minister alighted from their plane and rushed in the building of bella Center for meetings in camera and conferences of information , so that they can make claims that will be discussed during the following week .
The real image of gathering -- during which 13 000 people come in and out of Congress palace every day -- activists guitar players are nocturnal entertainment mocked countries that to betray and that proposals are submitted and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- constitutes a real challenge .
The intensity is on the increase : almost all important ministers are here and not later than on Wednesday , 60 Heads of Government will be in Copenhagen .
We are entering the big boys , stated Carlos Manuel Rodríguez , Vice-President to world politics of conservation international .
Lorries arrive .
In Britain , the first package to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome of Monday
A 5h13 , Monday morning , a percera whistle at night for signalling the beginning of a process which will mark a revolution of transport in Britain .
The first high-speed commuter train the country will reach 225 km / h , whereas it filera of ashford , in Kent , London St pancras , covering the 93 km in 38 minutes .
Lord adonis , the transport minister , will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train javelin outside London .
We hope that the new service will allow Britain to incorporate an international network of high-speed trains and reliable and will connect the Midlands large conurbations , northern and Scotland in London .
Small cities become lost holes suburban locomotives flourishing business travel will be far less long and the passage of the aircraft and the car will reduce the train domestic carbon while reducing congestion on roads .
In theory , the three main political parties adhering to this project .
But the ten billion needed to build a new railway network , the battle of planning inevitable and fears of environmental hazards threaten to delay British high-speed lines .
According to the times , high speed two ( hs2 ) , a company established in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report , will make its document to Lord adonis on 30 December .
This will provide a detailed map the route of the next phase for the high-speed network .
The new line linking London to be established in the West Midlands five metres from the urban and sites where the impact on the environment will be controversial .
In the campaign , the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route .
It is also envisaged that hs2 present three options for a high-speed network more towards the North .
Lord adonis responds to the spring .
Preferential options are highlighted in a configuration in which a high-speed line IRA until the West Midlands .
The line is in two separate at or near Birmingham , with a branch towards the Western pennines àmanchester and Scotland and another towards the north-east , towards Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne .
A single line will cut across Scotland .
" It seems that this will be the best option has said a professional performance of rail .
When it is completed , the travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced at 2 p.m. 40 minutes .
The first part , which will not begin until 2025 , will enable all passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes , compared to a trip to one hour currently .
The proposals will enable the train to travel to 400km / h , making the fastest British network in the world .
The initial route is designed to allow 400m trains in length and capable of carrying 1100 people .
Until 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham .
A terminal can accommodate 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary .
Since data constraints of space , it is envisaged that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network .
The rail industry experts say that only St pancras international or euston offer this opportunity .
Lord adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place , but the public consultations and longer planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken until a general election .
Even if it gets the machine , the network should be built party by party .
Trains will firstly obliged to drive out of high-speed lines on track in the north of Birmingham , retaining journey times between London and Scotland than three hours .
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a aeroplanes trains , constituting a point of reference for the revolution of the railways .
Taxpayers repay the loan to 75,000 GBP for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan , principal Member of Parliament Tory , made pay to the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of a Orangerie he has built in his home in his constituency .
The leader of the party which has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that Members of Parliament were " maintained " , has increased its loan 75,000 GBP to build an extension in oak at its second home , Rutland .
He had been authorized to make additional pay the interest , amounting to hundreds of books per month , to the taxpayer .
The authorities of Commons received complaints at that time and have not been questioned by Sir Thomas legg , who commits the control of Members ’ expenses . Last night , Mr Duncan stated that ' the complaints could not be clearer and simpler " .
Mr Duncan , one of the richest Members of Parliament , is the owner of a home in two stages in a village in his constituency of Rutland - melton .
The neighbouring houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds .
The first consists of a kitchen , a lounge and dining room , but the Bureau of emoluments asserts that Mr Duncan needed more space .
Last year , it has added a veranda at home , describing in its plans as a orangeraie .
The neighbours describe it as a " veranda for pleasure ' .
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give explanations to the increase of borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of privileges and standards of the Commons , concerning its provisions prior borrowing .
The committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules , after an investigation into its expenditure .
In 2004 , Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of 271.406 GBP of his property of London at home in her constituency that it has acquired in 1991 , the year before becoming a Member of Parliament .
The documents issued this week show that Mr Duncan claimed roughly $ 1.4 GBP per month of interest on loans until March last year .
In April , its demands have increased by more than 1800 GBP per month .
The interest rate on rbs borrowing Mr Duncan has not been changed in that time , suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan 75,000 GBP .
The standard rbs variable interest rates rose from 7,94 % in December 2007 to 4 % in March this year , nothing since then .
The latest publication of the authorities of Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1.250 GBP in May .
Mr Duncan has lost his cabinet officer ghost in September , after that a journalist under coverage has supposedly filmed stating that Members of Parliament should survive " on budget " after the scandal of expenditure .
" Indeed , now it is national , you must live " on budget ' and you are treated as " E ' m …
He said : ' I spent my money on my garden and I asked a fraction , based on what was correct .
And I could ask sacrément more , but I did not do so . '
The Member of Parliament , millionnaire since its former position as oil dealer , began to explain its expenditure , in May , after it has appeared that he had asked thousands of pounds for her garden , before agreeing with the office of the costs they " could be regarded as excessive " .
An activist has widened a hole in the form of GBP in the lawn of m Duncan , to protest once it has been revealed that it had requested 4000 GBP for three years .
When asked about the increase of borrowing , last night , Mr Duncan said : " It was for improvements capitals , approved at the time by the office of costs and then by legg . "
He added : ' There is no problem of fudge or preparation or use of rules or whatever .
It was quite clear , in the rules , authorized , etc .
This could not be clearer and simpler . "

Late payment : anger prison guards , actions planned
The unions have called for prison guards Friday to the " general mobilization " to demand payment by the holidays premiums and overtime which payment was delayed until January for budgetary reasons .
Fo-pénitentiaire ( 2nd syndicate of guards ) asked the personnel who will not be in service to manifest Tuesday morning before prisons and the " block " for " denounce the theft of their due " .
The cgt-pénitentiaire ( 3rd syndicate of the profession ) calls on ' meet in general assemblies in various prisons for a strong mobilization " , suggesting ' shameful and unacceptable " non-payment in December ' overtime , premiums at night of Sundays and public holidays " developed in October .
And the first syndicate supervisors , the federal Union prison autonomous ( ufap / unsa ) , " calls for the general mobilization ( ... ) pass the frustration and anger " .
Prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted , but ensure that residues will be paid in January .
The Chancellery clarified by the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions prefects guaranteeing that this payment would be done next month .
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernising our prison system , writing the Minister of Justice in this letter .
I asked prison administration be established without delay a set of measures that this situation due to an erroneous assessment overtime does not recur in the future , adds Mrs Alliot-Marie .
The pay of December will therefore be lean , except for the staff of direction benefiting the infamous premiums functions and objectives , deplored the ufap / unsa , for which ' fiscal constraints have good back " .
It is a pure scandal , has outraged the Union interregional Fo of Marseille in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice " all meetings and meetings ' .
The staff will not work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularised in December , idem for overtime also threatens Fo rhône-alpes-auvergne .
As it increases our tasks and missions without increasing our numbers , it is more than regrettable to dare to tackle the staff purse , believes the cgt-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux .
According to the trade unions , the situation is not the same in all regions , some of which are less badly off than others .
But in any case it does not add up , found the Secretary-General of the ufap , Jean-François forget .

The UDF association , controlled by the modem François Bayrou , reacted Friday to the attempt to takeover of the President of the new centre , Hervé Morin , on the ex-parti written in the giscardien , making more use it no support , under threat of prosecution .

They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and setting up an office to defend " the material and moral interests " training founded by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing .
As for Mr Hervé de Charette , pursues the Bureau , " when it has tabled the words " , it was " more adherent of the UDF since three years ' , but to the UMP .

But the 15th correctional also ordered that medical evidence of liliane bettencourt , aged 87 years , should be waged collectively by three doctors .
The heir and principal shareholder de L 'Oreal has always refused to go along with such a review , at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation .
Doctors designated Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying especially if liliane bettencourt was able to find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods .
I think that it will submit .
I will speak , stated at the end of the hearing the advocate of Mrs bettencourt , am Georges kiejman .
For its part , the advocate of Françoise bettencourt-meyers , am Olivier metzner , welcomed the decision of the Court .
This is excellent news ( ... ) the expertise will demonstrate that it ( Mr banier ) has handled this lady older than we must protect , he claimed .
For two years , the daughter of liliane bettencourt has committed criminal proceedings against françois-marie photographer and banier touche-à-tout artist , for having taken advantage for years the weakness of its mother to obtain a billion euros of grants , in the form of cheques , life insurance contracts or tables of teachers .
For its part , liliane bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer , which it regards as a long-standing friend .
While the Court should examine the admissibility of the work undertaken by Mrs bettencourt-meyers , arguments lawyers have sometimes painted by family naming Friday .
Thus , the advocate of liliane bettencourt indicated three letters from its client ( in 1999 , 2003 and 2005 ) to its notary , in which she said beware of the husband of Françoise bettencourt-meyers .
In the letter of 2003 , liliane bettencourt added , according to the lawyer : " Would you please explain to my daughter , that I wrote to banier once , twice a day for fifteen years .
Françoise , I have never been able to talk to him since her marriage " .
For its part , the prosecution of Nanterre again suggested that the plaintiff was not admissible to act , especially since a guardianship judge refused in recent days to allay his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother .
Liliane bettencourt " has full capacity to act , it is not under protection and has not guardian .
Nobody else has to act in his place ' , said the representative of the public prosecutor , marie-chrsitine daubigney .
The Court has finally decided that it would decide once the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Mrs bettencourt-meyers .
Managerial revolution or end of the intelligence economic ?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies , our fight for the economic development of the intelligence in vain …
For over a decade , the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis its employees , recalls the corporate position vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing : it comes to accede collaborators to ' values ' determined from above as it was in the past , to impose products to consumers conceived by the technicians of the plant .
By putting the client at the heart of the company , the revolution has supplied the marketing strategies of the conquest of markets to the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products detached from the preferences of factors reappears clienteles regularly !
Demobilization of employees may lead to a deadly demoralisation .
Suicides in France Telecom , Renault PSA or are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects the frameworks .
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company , including R & D and , even more so , in the economic intelligence .
Indeed , ie " requires all stakeholders ( … ) a pro-active and a forward-looking vision ' ; it requires by employees a commitment that the income of management authoritarian totally opposed .
That is why we call for a managerial revolution cultivating the staff at the centre of the company in the same way as the customer .
The usefulness relative internal opinion surveys
The opinion polls carried out – as the internal orange questionnaire submitted by its salariés- going to incite this revolution in managerial practices ?
Unfortunately , I am afraid not .
Firstly because I have noticed that , faced with a new situation , any structure is finally coming in , after many detours , priority … what it has always done . !
- secondly because authoritarianism – a pathologies of pouvoir- increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures .
- lastly , because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour .
From the grandes écoles engineers , they have a mechanistic interpretation psychology .
They adopt , by comfort intellectual , the old theory behavioriste , cranked up recently by the neuroscience " us " and widely disseminated , without their knowledge , by the institutes of education and the media .
Thus , suggesting that it is possible to handle the " levers " ( sic ) the commitment of managers , a recent survey of ipsos published in the figaro.fr conforte-t-elle leaders in a position of governance mechanistic , unsuited to today 's world .
Identify and assess the factors of mobilization
On the contrary , the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises , implies a finalist vision of human behaviour .
It is to integrate , throughout reasoning or governance practice , a fundamental observation : for employees , the commitment to the company is possible only if it emerges clearly as a means of achieving part of their dreams , their ambitions , their projects .
Currently , only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design motives of employees .
These studies have shown that they consider their enterprise based on a predetermined doxa which enables them , through their image seen of the company , to assess what it offers them to achieve their lives .
Thanks to the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilization , business managers can control , forecasting and anticipate their " performance social " and surrender their management of human resources ' on the ground ' .
So they create a breeding ground for the coordinated development of a robust economic intelligence and effective .
Oslo speech : the " just war " applies praise from the right to Obama
The US right-wingers welcomed Friday , the speech made yesterday in Oslo by Barack Obama , satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of us .
Conservatives , who had brocardé the award to Barack Obama on 9 October , applauded this time the presidential speech , like Sarah Palin , former candidate for the vice-presidency during the recent elections in 2008 .
I liked what he said , Mrs Palin , égérie right wing of the Republican Party everyday USA today , adding having itself addressed the topic of war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs just issued .
The war is , of course , the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do , but it is necessary .
We must stop these terrorists everything out there , it said .
Mr Obama , which has inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan , has worked on Thursday at Oslo to justify the use of force , a way to explain its decision to send 30,000 troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier .
Another opponent of Mr Obama , Newt Gingrich suggested that the President had made in Oslo ' very good job ' .
I found that the speech was really very well , welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives , which has particularly appreciated the reference to ' the existence of evil in the world " in the presidential speech .
By some side , I found this speech wholly background , said Mr Gingrich , interrogated when the radio programme " the takeaway " .
The former elected , regarded by some as a possible at the investiture Republican candidate for the presidential election of 2012 , was delighted to have seen " a chairman left " remind Members of the Nobel Committee " that they were not free , and they could call a price for peace if the use of force does not exist ' .
Michael gerson , former pen from George W. Bush converted back columnist at the Washington Post , Mr Obama gave " a speech very American " .
In addition to stand in " world citizen " as " it always does " , " he spoke as an American President " , recalling the Europeans ' that they live in a bubble security that they have not established and they do little to preserve it ' , said Mr gerson .
Among the few right not to be convinced , a hawkish outlook of the Bush era , the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton , described the discourse of purple dull , " and without inspiration " on the site national review online .
Has the left of the President , the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify recourse to force .
When we envelope war in the notion of justice , it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people , he warned .
The press centre-left complimentary remained for the chairman .
The Los Angeles Times , while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama , described his address ' superproduction ' even for a speaker known for his talent .
The Oslo speech " should serve as a roadmap for guide international decisions against conflict , poverty and oppression , " ignited the daily Californian .
Mr Obama " gave the speech that he was " , has estimated the New York Times , the ruling " both dark and enlightening " .

It is not much , but it is very far , explained Patrice closed ( Fo ) .
Either we will give the order to our activists that there are no obstacles , no embargo refuelling centres .
But we can always have some recalcitrant Member States who are not happy , he added .
Philippe grillot , President of tlf , welcomed ' a good agreement ' , even though it was " difficult to concede the increases on the top earners given international competition ' .
According to him , the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest .

The signing of tlf allows the agreement applies initially companies belonging to this organisation , and in a second phase of the profession in any event by the Minister of labour .
It will become " without delay " , assured Mr Bussereau .

For the otre , the agreement risk " digging the grave d ? a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ' .

The Turkish judicial dissolved the Kurdish party , far-reaching decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court gave Friday , the dissolution of the main Kurdish party of the country , a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations anger in the Kurdish community , in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul .
This decision may complicate job much of the government , which has just reaching out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict .
The Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) has been dissolved because it had become a " hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its unity indivisible ' , told the press President of the Court Hasim kiliç , after four days of deliberations .
The decision has been taken unanimously of 11 judges , whereas a qualified majority of seven votes was required to dissolve , said Mr kiliç , adding that 37 senior party , including its President Ahmet Türk and the Member aysel tugluk , are banned from political life for a period of five years .
The judge has also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed Mr Türk and Mrs tugluk Treasury and the confiscation of the property of the Party .
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament ( on 550 ) .
Its leaders had accused before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label .
The decision followed a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman yalçinkaya , who accuses the DTP to obey ' guidelines ' of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , regarded as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries .
Many observers believe that the DTP is the window legal policy rebels of the PKK .
The Party assured , however , that it has " no " organic links with the PKK but refuses to any qualification of terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him .
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government has just reaching out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights , to try to nip the support of the Kurds , the PKK and put an end to the conflict .
The leaders of the DTP claimed that an dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tension in the South-East Anatolia , where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have spilled over into clashes with the police in recent weeks .
Since the announcement of justice , a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir , the great south-eastern city populated predominantly Kurds .
The security forces fired tear gas and water cannon used , while demonstrators were throwing Molotov cocktails or stones , with slingshots .
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul .
After the verdict , Mr Türk asserted that the decision of justice would " deepening despair . "
Turkey cannot resolve this issue ( Kurdish , ndlr ) by prohibiting a party , he said to the press .
The government , formed by a party from the Islamist movement , also regretted the decision .
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties .
This does not solve , declared the Minister for energy yildiz Taner .
This decision is a total torpedoing of democratic openness initiated by the government , commented on the political analyst Ahmet insel .
We can expect , of course , with a reaction of the PKK , he added .
On Thursday , the PKK has claimed an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey , one of the most lethal in recent months .

The project s21 : a brake for Stuttgart
We cannot place rather high , the magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project .
For his followers that is nothing less than ' new heart of Europe ’ .
If one wants . S21 , that is far more than the burial of a railway station , more than a colossal building project which will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg , in a shipyard hopelessly chaos for some ten years .
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s .
Marshalling front line , with approaches that correspondence in full city , were known at the time to be the technical relics of the nineteenth-century transport which were brake sabot effect of modern rail traffic because there was once a long time to get locomotives in the back to before .
Arrival , judgment short , departure – that is what we need to do .
That is why marshalling front line must disappear : in Frankfurt and in Munich .
And Stuttgart also : a crossing terminal trains , situated halfway around on the trans-European rail masterly between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan " core Europe " .
The project s21 will really begin , although the visions of the 1980s are no longer long compatible with reality .
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost , to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria , was exorbitant .
Indeed , the front line stations are becoming problems of entry and exit since it has been modern trains , reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends .
However it is now launching the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new inter-city line towards Ulm .
Regional and communal policies prevailed .
The railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who gets the greatest project risks infrastructure of the Federal Republic and not the public company .
From the point of view of town planning this project is relatively well justified .
It obtains a urban space that – if one is to believe the graphs planners generated by computer – will be very verdoyant .
For the system of rail transport the s21 is harmful .
The station crossings and enlargement of the section are designed for a trafficking which assigned - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth .
Has the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights .
Modern traffic policy should concentrate firstly on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more friendly by lorry on the road .
But the new route , with its leanings , not suitable for freight trains .
The s21 , and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects .
For example , six billion euros will be engulfed in the draft the souabe .
That is the official figure .
Experts agree that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic .
One thing is for sure , in the next decade will this money for other nodes and congestion in the network .
The list of Transport Ministry mentions in any sixty major projects .
One of the most important is the enlargement of section through the Rhine valley 180 km .
Since 1987 this line is built in slow motion .
It would be truly urgent to support here to build on fungus .
But the project s21 acted like braking trailing a narrow shoe or foot .
The route of the Rhine valley is becoming the bottleneck international freight traffic , and this in the heart of Europe .
The government considers the judgement on the airport
In Wiesbaden regional Parliament , the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights .
The Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter m ( FDP ) announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the judgement by the Administrative Court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages .
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the planned construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of Frankfurt airport is to become a reality .
The authorisation of attérir for 17 had between 23h and 5.00 a.m. as envisaged in the Land government , is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night .
The coalition must be decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgement .
The opposition criticism this deadline and tries to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig .
The head of the parliamentary group torsten SPD schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban night flights ; otherwise , it will be condidéré as a total failure to a word .
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to keep its word , said the head of the Greens Tarek al-wazir alluding to the slogan éléctoral the FDP " we fulfil our promises " .
The Minister Dieter m refute the accusations of schäfer-gümbel who claims that the land government tries to authorize when even night flights using " of avocasserie and roublardises " .
It takes time to carry out a precise legal consideration .
The coalition is not to take decisions on the basis of a ' first impression swift ' .
That decision must be legally reliable , said Stefan Müller ( FDP ) .
The interpretation of the opposition of the statements by its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée .
US banks reimburse the aid
The big American banks , deeply affected by the crisis , have taken away from them their ties vis-à-vis the state .
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it fully repaid to the Treasury $ 45 billion ( over EUR 30 billion ) , corresponding to the aid granted under the TARP rescue plan .
The chaine American television cnbc stated in a report that Citigroup also envisaged to reimburse the aid received .
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions , which accompanied the acceptance of are , as for example the limitation of bonus allocated to LEADER so that the regulation of higher charges .
The Bank of americaa launched a capital increase by selling securities with investors who told him 19 billion dollars of fresh money .
The rest of the sum comes from the coffers of the Bank which have been met through the sale of several branches in other sectors .
Last Wednesday evening , Kenneth Lewis the Director-General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank American taxpayers : capital injection greatly helped overcome a difficult period .
The banking institution had presumed capacity by purchasing the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil .
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on financial markets in order to get rid of state control .
The American Bank could launch from Thursday , a capital increase of 20 billion dollars , highlighted the chaine cnbc citing the banking circles .
The spokesman of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information .
In June banks , JP Morgan chase Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were repaid public funds which they had benefited .
Accelerated election
Actually it has nevertheless past faster than expected .
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of head redacteur nikolaus brender by the Governing Council of the German chaine ZDF , the successor is already appointed .
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to carry out the appointment .
Peter Frey who heads the editor Berlin was the arch-favorite ZDF .
The chaine , however , has not wanted to confirm - formally - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure .
However , it seems that there was also the intention of not more damaging to the Governor of the ZDF Markus schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Governing Council .
Frey , who is the candidate of schächter , needs the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14 .
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition .
Two weeks ago , schächter had proposed to the Governing Council to extend for five years the contract of nikolaus brender but this had been rejected .
Only 7 Council members expressed their support for the continuation of brender and 7 others had voted against . The dismissal by vote of brender represented a failure for schächter although predictable .
Indeed , the CDU majority in the Governing Council had already hinted several weeks before the vote , not wanting to renew brender to his post .
It is Roland Koch , the minister-president of Hessen Land that organized a league against the editor-in-chief .
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief be extended by invoking the fact that the emission listener information ZDF had fallen under brender .
That is why protests were still taking place , virtually until the vote lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF .
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law which had intruded into the debate and who believed that the way Koch unconstitutional .
But this will have achieved nothing .
Peter Frey : who is it ?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to bingen .
It has studied the sciences-politiques , teaching etles Romance languages ( Spanish ) .
He then worked in südwestfunk ( radio body of Rhineland-Palatinate ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau ( German daily national scope ) .
In 1983 it becomes editor within the ZDF firstly to the magazine topical " heute-journal " ( Journal today ) .
Then its journey continues : from 1988 to 1990 he was then rédacteur-en-chef deputy ; then corresponding to Washington in 1991 / 1992 , then until 1998 it was head and presenter of " morgenmagazins " ( television bimonthly trail presented the morning ) ; until 2001 there was chief of the foreign policy of the ZDF and head of the Berlin drafting .
After the disgrace of brender , whereas now it had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine medium magazin , the Greens have announced that they would lodge a constitutional complaint
The Koch opponent of the Governing Council , the minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck , said last week that the Länder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the Governor of staff cannot be blocked by a political majority biased .
However , Beck has no plans to demand withdrawal of political personalities members of committees for monitoring the ZDF .
Peter Frey , the likely successor of brender had manoeuvred skilfully with the Executive Board in criticising the Commission vehemently in its decision to remove brender .
Thanks to this , schächter journalistic independence was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face , as well as the Governing Council could elect without being put soupconne post a supporter policy .
In arithmetical representations of parties , Frey is classified liberal left-wing .
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students : after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs of Länder decide to be more accommodating : at a meeting between ministers and representatives from the Conference of Presidents , an agreement has been developed stipulating that the working conditions of students bachelor or master should be improved .
In future , students should be able to overcome their studies .
They particularly put to lighten the burden of accordpour examination : a single examination must enable us to conclude the study module chosen .
Moreover , the burden of work must be reconsidée proportions to ensure " realistic and acceptable " .
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad .
The Länder are also committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for streams of bachelor and master .
At regional level , there must be no regulation from one State to another .
Fewer examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests last June , the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the expression : ' étudiabilité fashionable ' .
But for the first time , this expression seems to take a practical meaning .
The accreditation Council decided to reduce substantially the number of some reviews : " each unit should normally be concluded by a single examination " , we read in a document of some thirty pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles .
Reinhold Grimm , President of the Council said that accreditation notably reducing the burden of examinations should be able to stop the abuses , which are harmful to the étudiabilité considerably .
The ' étudiabilité " should moreover be , in future , the decisive criterion of organisation of studies .
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this feeling of stifling that sometimes it feels in the choice of course .
HAMBURG / Berlin - according to the latest knowledge in raid on team , the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence karl-theodor zu guttenberg ( CSU ) is guilty of deliberate deception .
Students should " have the opportunity and the necessary room for manoeuvre to enable and encourage personal initiative ' .
The new regulation will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to the existing cycles .
These cycles should be " réaccrédités " every 5 years , which means , however , that only by 2015 that all cycles have been examined .
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies on the entire country that depend on accreditation Council created by the Länder .
In October , the education ministers had exercised a certain amount of pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too responsible and testing procedures not too strict .
In some Länder , universities and colleges specialising have already heard with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures .
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only land to have agreed to grant more resources to developing the Bologna process .
With these funds , universities must mount programmes tutorielset strengthen educational guidance offices as well as offices of examinations and the service of international relations
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million .
In early 2010 , the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education establishments .
Following that there will be no more make one consideration to close its studies .
Organisation of studies should be more flexible , more must be guaranteed the recognition of records of notes other institutions of higher education and access to master must be simplified .
By the end of next year , the " étudiabilité " of all university cycles will be considered .
Last Thursday , the government and the opposition have again discussed the question of the conditions of studies in the country .
The décisionsont been appreciated but there have been some criticisms .
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist students has indicated that it would like the organization of education policy passes more to the future " behind closed doors ' ministers and university rectors .
At the latest after the educational strike , students as persons concerned should be able to speak a little .
Future diplomés of higher education it received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Presidents ( hrk ) Margret wintermantel : " the experience of students is very useful ' she said Thursday , at a meeting with the education ministers of the Länder with which the hrk works on a draft common reform .
For the Union of education and science ( gew ) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough ; it calls for the right and the opportunity for each bachelor degrees from enrol in a cycle of master .
Andreas Keller Member of the Steering Committee of the gew also requested that the Länder provide students bachelor today , that tomorrow there will be sufficient room for studies in master and conditions of studies as good as possible .
The Länder must therefore employ more lecturers .
By contrast , the Education Ministers have not mentioned the possibility to ease access to master .
More than a footnote on France herta Müller
It is by these words ‘ arrival in Germany and it is beautiful , almost more control ... ' that began a work of poet Werner söllner , in which he thématise in pieces of sentences troubling , the experiences of a dissident happened in Germany which has gained freedom but has lost at the same time its linguistic territory .
Werner söllner , born in 1951 to banat in Romania , was first Professor a German and English in Bucharest and , subsequently , Director of collection publishing houses for youth before settle in Frankfurt on the hand .
Söllner has received different prices literary ; in 1993 it took the Chair very coveted poetry Goethe university in Frankfurt and since 2002 it is Director of the forum for literature Hesse artist 's House of mousonturm in Frankfurt .
He has done a lot of him in circles literary not last Tuesday , during a congress in Munich , the theme of which was the " German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorting the mirror of your files Securitate " .
Obviously destabilized and embarrassed , söllner made a statement in which it reconnut before his colleagues writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner , William totok , Franz hodjak , and Helmuth frauendorfer he had worked as an informer by political police Securitate .
Söllner has received in 1989 the price of the German jointly with some of the participants .
The testing of recruitment began insidiously in 1971 .
I am , concludes söllner " therefore someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate . "
The poet Werner söllner is the informant Walter ( im Walter ) .
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of Nobel Prize for France herta Müller literary copies and its dealings with the levers of power of the dictatorship , the scene literary is shaken and especially the Community of German authors from Romania , by a case which clearly shows the abyss and a political system based on policing and spying .
Werner söllner is , as far as one can say straight after the current knowledge , not only guilty but also a victim .
In his own dossier Securitate , im Walter has played a role , assured the specialist literature Michael Markel after the denomination of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of im Walter who had intervened in its favour .
He had been drawn from all difficult situations at the time , " according to Markel .
Moralde Markel felt the need to make this comment .
The form in which söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected , however the confession of a former dissident collaboration with the secret services Romanians is in fact , not so surprising .
Germany is a very nice for the reserve of the Securitate spies France herta Müller had already written in July in the newspaper Die Zeit ” , having read the 914 pages of its own dossier .
Presumably the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names hid last names sorin borrowing , voicu and also Walter .
Unlike Germany where between time consulting the Stasi files is a reliable process , the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused .
A systematic clarification has been constantly frustrated and hampered in the past .
It is only in 1999 that a national Council corresponding to the institution birthler was established to work to assimilation of archives of the Securitate ( cnsas ) but restitution dossiers has been rather prolonged since .
It has existed since 2005 a law that defines the management of archives .
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great , is confirmed by the interview with a former head of the Securitate of temesvar who , after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to France herta Müller , said so trés contemptuous towards the winner .
It had a psychosis , and ultimately was originally questioned only once .
The infamy of power was intending to speak here , without any gene , under cover of the freedom of expression .
Admittedly , many are unavoidable issues associated with the case söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt hidden .
Why now ? which has been robbed ? the prudent reaction listeners , to the admission of söllner , gives us hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame .
On the genesis of the effect of France herta Müller , who has received yesterday the Nobel Prize , is more than a footnote .
Storms in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative arrived here , printed in four épingles from any right of a nice Christmas holiday , on which the manufacturer sportswear had displayed its goods when the new coach vfb Christian gross 11th-grade students from monta at a quarter past midnight in a Mercedes class C , that it had just draw , a plastic bag supplier orange .
The man , whose skull chauve drew attention , allowed himself to lead in the city that was still Foreign .
Otherwise our 50-year-old could take itself the steering wheel – it had not been drinking alcohol and neither did he intoxicated happiness .
He spent a pleasant but tomorrow evening to resume the work .
It is now that it would start .
The words of Switzerland that you came employ three days earlier were clear : ‘ we have reached the final eighth of ' , that is to say in the Champions League through our 3 : 1 against unirea urziceni Romania ' but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success and it is a brutal struggle for lapsing back " .
The " large work " us Sunday .
Here , it is repeated in Mainz the results of the Champions League in everyday life .
And we will need to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three aims expedited of marica ( 5 ) , träsch ( 8 . ) and pogrebnyak ( 11 . )
Lots
The eighth of concluding the Champions League ( match go 16 / 17 . + 23 / 24 February / return match 9 . / 10 + 16 . / 6 March ) will be drawn the ( December to nyon .
The joy of the inauguration fulminante the successor of babbel was therefore mild .
And joy was not only moderate among those who filed a chance , who had forwarded to professionals of Stuttgart destabilized , motivated and pleasure to play .
I have been see players and I told them that they must focus on their strengths , I advised to be more courageous , expliqua ' souls plumber " – gross - the recipe for success , which was whether bienmais which did more with the soigneur babbel effects .
It has triggered a certain magic confessed Jens he - supporter of babbel - , " in the foot when there is a new impulse it sometimes happens one would never have believed possible ' .
Khedira Sami and which , after weeks of pause for avança wound , as one of the best golfer through its dynamism , tried to describe the proverbial ” phenomenon seen by a ‘ fresh breeze ” and the working method of the new head : ‘ It is someone who takes action and requires discipline .
That is what we need in the current situation .
But apparently babbel had failed .
The vfb Stuttgart has not yet surpassed , warned the manager Horst heldt
For the moment , vfb Stuttgart has mostly need tenacity .
Just as gross , players and the manager tightlipped about overvalue the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanians .
They had also won in Glasgow before we have had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with the 0 : 4 , objecta khedira .
Horst heldt , managers , signala that they have achieved the objectives of the season but that they had others who were still far away .
We have not yet out of the woods yet .
That heldt the day of its 40th anniversary did not the heart to celebrate , even after the first victory at home for three months , is the weekend 's events in a television interview warder purpose Jens he did pick up just before the start of the game .
There are others to take decisions and not Jens , contrecarrait heldt , in response to the criticism of he .
He accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it was decided to change coach under pressure from pubertaires fans .
He had found also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that its matches free day after it has been deleted .
He statements were marked by a ‘ unadulterated egotism " heldt ground and announced consequences for the guardian of purpose .
They might become friends for life these two quadragénaires .
In any cast , they were agree to everything else , that is to say that without the prior work group by the coach replaced , strong and combative sporting representation would not have been possible .
Babbel and his aides were " for a large part in the success rétorquèrent heldt and he in chorus – and even the man in acquiesça plastic bag .
HGV World Cup
Hot struggle to Bern : Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly engineered verbally and gestuellement the champion of the world vitali klitschko .
But after twelve rounds Ukrainian difficult advocated a champion of the world of HGV according to the version of the Russian wbc .
A unanimity of judges it imposed to points .
HAMBURG – vitali klitschko retains its title of the world champion of the lorry .
The Russian announced that in the wbc Saturday night the champion of 38 years had won a victory to the points that unaminité magistrates against the American Kevin Johnson ( 120 : 10 ) .
For the third time klitschko defends with honour its title since its comeback on stage in October 2008 .
Before that Ukraine had already won twice the title of the world champion wbc and wbo federations .
Unfortunately he has failed the long-awaited Ko .
Klitschko , walked out 39 times winner in 41 fighting professionals , a of confess twice its defeat through injury .
The Challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat the 24th struggle .
In the arena of Berne , before 17,000 spectators , the great klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight , from its 2.02 metres , by its against left .
Johnson , eleven centimetres smallest which , before the duel , had announced the end of the era klitschko , managed to avoid the blows of the champion , empéchant so klitschko bring into play its against right-wing dangeureuse .
Johnson , too passive in action for a challenger , has primarily tried to move the rounds .
Although it continued to cause klitschko in words and gestures firing blanks travelled only very rarely the champion .
Surely it is the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000 , a overshooting with klitschko distance of twelve rounds .
The highly publicized challenger in the capital Switzerland before the fight .
It insulta klitschko his ‘ ugly Zombie " that " is not really capable ” .
During the weighing on Friday , the champion was unable to stop provoke Johnson in him falling its sunglasses nose ' to see its eyes .
Fourth victory since the comeback of klitschko .
Klitschko imposed again in its fourth struggle since its comeback on 11 October 2008
After a pause for almost four years ago was defeated at the time the national Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered " their " wbc belt that he had previously abandon without a struggle .
This year , defending its title of champion , it won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez Cuba and September against Chris arreola of the USA .
' I have just taken a coup in this fight and am in complete form ” had said klitschko to explain its swift return into the ring .
Its rève is to try to bring in the family the four most important titles .
His brother wladimir is champion federations wbo and ibf .
But it is the British David Hague who , having détroné the great Nikolai walujew - 2.13 metres - in November , is the wba belt .
This summer , Hague had cancelled a game against vitali klitschko scheduled for September .
It would appear that its development company intends to do now play this game at the stage Wembley in London .
The team case
Opposition frontal attack : the head of the Group of the Greens , Jürgen Trittin , has accused the Minister of Defence guttenberg of lying in the case of the team affair .
The SPD parties and the left ( the left ) demand to Chancellor explanations .
HAMBURG / Berlin - after consideration of the latest information on air strikes of team , the opposition has criticized the Minister for Defence karl-theodor zu guttenberg ( CSU ) for délibérémentdissimulé certain facts .
The Minister has intentionally " made an untruth " on the murderous affects two tankers last September , said the leader of the Group of the Greens , Jürgen Trittin , Saturday , during the broadcast information chaine ARD " Tagesschau " ( the Journal of 20h ) .
Clearly , this means that he lied .
To kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan ( ISAF ) .
It is , in essence , the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr guttenberg Trittin , has said .
Last Friday , according to new revelations of the media , the objective of lafrappe was in reality , not to destroy lorries stolen , but was much to eliminate two heads Taliban important .
The report of the inquiry of NATO , 142 people were killed and injured in the American air strike which was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein , military commander of team .
The Greens , the SPD and the left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) , to take a decision as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what guttenberg really knew about the incident .
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say if the strategy of targeted massacre is part of Afghan politics of government fédéralet if the Chancellery , the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy .
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms .
The Chancellery has by no facon influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan , he said .
On Saturday , voices were increasingly strong to express the real reasons doutesquant the dismissal of the chief inspector Wolfgang schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter wichert , as had been submitted by the Ministry .
According to information from the Journal Spiegel , the information that they had delivered to guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete .
Officially , they would have hidden the existence of the report of NATO and hiding in Minister some details troublesome .
In the vicinity of two officials someone suggests that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports , including a two-page document of Colonel Klein so that a report of the military police .
The ' Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung " reported that wichert would have meanwhile requested in a letter a factual clarification .
So far , it has not been answered
On Saturday , the Ministry has not wished to comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the Federal Parliament which would constitute the next Wednesday in order dapporter light on the facts .
The worlds of dreams
Some see , any awake , images and hear voices that nobody else seen or heard .
It is not only among the mentally ill , or under the effect of drugs , that the boundaries between the imagination and reality are combined .
Until they manifest themselves during the sleep , everything is fine .
When we are lying in our houses clouded , we can engage without barriers to dreams and wildest fantasies .
However whoever , awake , experience to dream , heard and sees things that others do not perceive , has quickly reputation in our Western world to be crazy or junkie , or at least to be an original .
Such images and votes are not among the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs .
That is our imagination that is at stake : it is the same neuronale activity which enables us to devise houses , painting tables or write volumes , but which sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream , madness and reality to fade .
A state of awakening aware , taking the form of a dream , may arise all kinds , at best it is called visions , at worst madness .
But even if the trigger and effect differ , the visions of the mystique hildegard von bingen , the experiences of drugs in the prophet of new age Carlos castaneda , the latter are States chamanes , psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to processes very similar .
There are delusions hallucinations or when the balance , neurotransmettrices substances of the brain - first and foremost the dopamine , noradrenalin , serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted .
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts manifest themselves very often during a psychosis schizophrenic .
The force of attraction land has more power over the person .
Since antiquity , philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between madness and a dream .
For Aristotle , the hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé ; Wilhelm griesinger , one of the founders of modern psychiatry , found in 1861 " great similarity between madness and the dream " Sigmund Freud , for the dream was even " a psychosis with all irregularities , imaginations , delusions and sensory illusions which the composed " .
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning t turns into a cartoon character .
His body is in two dimensions glaring colours .
Land attraction has more power over him , he is hovering in Raz the ceiling .
It feels a blow .
Behind ailées devil 's creatures , grimaçantes , mouths bloodied , showing its teeth .
They continue , giving legs with heavy boots , the bold cast against the walls , it feels the pain throughout the body .
Voices thundering howl , , vicious , falling walls and radio .
It can no longer bear them those voices who revile and humiliate .
Henning T. grubs up two cables of its stereo system , in fact a ring and attaches to a hook fixed ceiling .
It has to climb onto a baffle and happens the loop around the neck .
He leaps .
The loop stands out .
That this te a lesson , shout the voices in a chorus to lift the ear drum . " will in a clinic and fais-toi treat ! "
Today Henning T. has 40 years , he lived six acute psychoses , the last two years , the first almost 20 years .
It has been triggered by LSD .
The diagnosis : schizo-affective paranoid psychosis , moreover , it is maniaco-dépressif , it takes medicines against depression , the mania , schizophrenia .
It has learned to live with his illness , he is married for three years .
During the hype I have experienced terrible fears and despondency profound .
The illusions are a cruel reality .
Approximately a one per cent of the population is suffering at least once in her life of schizophrenia ; in psychiatric clinics that is the most common illness after depression .
In a crisis of schizophrenia , people can no longer make the difference between the world of procedure and the outside world , they find themselves in a state of wildly excitement , which are that they may suffer from hallucinations , otherworldliness of madness , relational or persecution .
It is very easy to hear voices – voices which demand , who criticize or who engage in dialogue .
The optical hallucinations are not uncommon either .
The person concerned cannot distinguish between the large and the small , the brain can no longer filtering disruptive signals , the aware is deluged with sensations .
Just as the dream , the hype opened the gates to a tide of ideas and fantasies adjournment of deeper layers of conscience .
The perception of reality in the hype is centred on the subject , Professor Thomas Fuchs , head of the Department of psychiatry University of Heidelberg ( Allgemeine psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum ) .
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation , everything to a meaning centred on him .
At the same time it is reflected in a passive role , it is a dream , overcome by events and cannot act on them actively .
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened , controlled , manipulated .
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality , the illusions are a cruel reality , wake up is excluded .
Experience once in her life of a hallucination .
Unlike the dream , according to Fuchs , " the space and sensory structure of reality that is seen during the hype , is fundamentally retained ' .
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on reality , the alienation of lived a place in a real framework .
Why does our brains ’ of this kind , is still a mystery for researchers .
Exceptional situations can persuade everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality , according to Fuchs .
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis .
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the sole determinant .
Researchers presuppose that the persons concerned are the petty brain damage .
It is assumed that the neuronale maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development , for example by a viral infection mothers during pregnancy , explains Fuchs .
But what still remains unexplained , this is how the defect in the system neuronal occurs and the fact that it does not present itself for many years .
Environmental factors are also playing a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis , however , if there is a predisposition .
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they affect neurotransmitters .
When our brains firewood .
This crazy , says Professor psychology Erich kasten in Lübeck , is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medicines to undo whilst others are buying dearly drug to obtain it .
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a question of perspective .
Kasten brings together for ten years of reports on the hallucinations and the phenomena of images illusory : last year it has issued its results in a book entitled " The windowdressing in our head ' .
The hallucinations form part of phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases .
They include mental illness as the borderline or depression but also a headache , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease or the head injuries .
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy individuals is subject to produce hallucinations .
The hallucinations , according to kasten , consist of fragments of which has been normally memories .
They are taking shape when the brain areas who treat perceptions , are hyperactives sensory or enough ; when our brains refrénées firewood but also when there is no stimulation .
Drugs can trigger this state as a brain damage or a psychosis .
But also the lack of stimulus , stress , debase of love exceptional mentally or other States .
In recent studies , one third of participants recognises have made at least once in her life experience a hallucination .
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. has 16 years , she lives a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and it goes to high .
A young girl completely normal do indeed .
If there were not the pictures and the vote .
For the rest , it is a young boy thin châtain long hair , wish him the floor .
When she replied his comrades are watching , surprised – nobody else seen or heard this boy .
They believe that this girl timid is a lunatic rêveuse but Sarah K do not dream , it is certain .
It is being stirred , heard and seen the boy just as it saw and heard the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench .
It may even receive his presence temporarily .
It is a pleasant sensation , she found this young sympathetic .
I am crazy ? , wondered it sometimes .
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and that they will disappear again .
The night appearances are , in general , frightening .
Often the visions are burdensome .
When it is in class , sometimes it can follow the course because Professor is just putting forward a new pupil in its eyes and ears when it is invisible to the other and that Professor is clearly being explain equations to table .
The night appearances are , in general , frightening .
When , in obscurity of his house , it looked sleep which comes too rarely and far too late , it can often not distinguish if it is being stirred or dream already , if the images that it sees , the faces grimaçants or girl with sanguinolentes scores on the arms and legs face its eyes open or closed .
Let me worry shouts it to these creatures .
It is not being discussed or his parents and his friends , they took to insane .
Autumn 2009 . Sarah K. has today 20 years .
It took his BAC last year and it is living with his friend .
A year ago the hallucinations ceased .
Since it came into contact with the psychologist Internet kasten it knows very well that it is not crazy .
Madness is also a work of art of despair .
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives , the likelihood is great that it has hallucinations after a certain time .
I assume that the brain not being occupied enough , ensured that there is facilitating .
Sarah K. , single daughter , was afraid of other children when it was small and often played alone .
Its hallucinations began when it learned to 13 years , that man she called Papa , ever since it was in age to believe , was not the true father .
These are the same brain areas which are active in the visual hallucinations and acoustic , and for the actual noise impressions and , therefore , it is very difficult for people as Sarah K to differentiate between the illusion and reality . " every experience ' , according to kasten " a place in the brain , the reality is formed from here .
The hallucinations images are also formed in the brain , so they seem so real . "
For kasten night , dreams are also a form of hallucination .
The hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychoses .
Unlike schizophrenic , the mentally healthy person is capable of recognising that fantasies , are not real images .
That is why kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent .
There is only one step between the dream and the hallucination .
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tendency to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies , according to Michael schmidt-degenhard , Professor at Heidelberg and chief physician psychiatric clinic and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale Düsseldorf .
A psychosis is a serious disease , painful but also contains something positive , creator - madness is a work of art of despair .
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience , a particular form of amending the conscience being stirred by the dream .
Experience oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves perceived as real by whoever the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening .
The state of conscience oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware , have a paralysis engine .
According to schmidt-degenhard , when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world , due to a total inability and sustainable move , it replaces the real situation that offends his life , by its own world fable which is disconnected from reality .
It is a state of mental limits between the dream and the hallucination .
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality , a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination .
It involves an intensive form of means and interpretation , in an intolerable situation in itself , a capacity of organisation which has been created , for we men , not to sink into the void of loss of conscience .
Everything is real even later in the memories .
The Zurich Peter Cornelius classen , art historian also described its experiences oniroïdes in his book ' change of heart " as action to safeguard the soul .
It has 49 years , when its aware part for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valves followed by a transplantation ; meanwhile , his body was sentenced to stand still in intensive care .
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created from nothing , visit places foreigners , trip over time ; it is an old man in a bedside rail tuberculosis , a robot to assist us ensuring their health .
He lives in the Middle Ages among the noble who manufacture drugs at basis of blood .
It is removed by a Greek mopeds who takes us in his country , he surfe with his hospital bed in the Alpine névé and meeting a Korean mafias .
It absorbs completely in this world imaginary , everything is real even later in its memories .
According to claussen inland these journeys differ fundamentally from any dream .
The dream is a completely different state , he wrote in describing what he lived .
Instead of dreams , memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later .
You could say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than real life .
The intensity of this lived sparked the horizon of our other everyday experiences , according to the schmidt-degenhard psychiatrist .
Ultimately , the mania oniroïdes , psychoses , the psychédéliques hallucinations and experiences show us how our internal representations from reality outside are fragile even in a state of eve .
Any change to the state of conscience , summarises the psychologist kasten " may lead to a distortion of what we call reality . "
An experiment that can also be quite enriching .
The first snowfall may fall
Burda
Twenty-seven years , children will be the result of the publishing house .
The appointment of kallen as CEO of editions burda is an intermediate solution : in the longer term , Hubert burda wishes its two children have the press group , he said to Journal Spiegel .
The holding must remain 100 % a family business .
HAMBURG - in the long term , the publisher Hubert burda sees its society in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit to 27 years and are firmly resolved to integrate into society , has said Hubert burda , 69 , on Spiegel .
All the details have been resolved in advance .
The question of whether they will be active in the company subsequently arise .
We must also see if they are capable of .
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 employees without whether they have the capacity to deal with that .
This would demolish children as well as the business .
Burda reported last Thursday that it will withdraw the post président-directeur-général as early as January and that his successor was paul-bernhard kallen .
Kallen , 52 years , is a Member of the Governing Council since 1999 .
It was first responsible technological sector .
It subsequently sector with treasure it is to say that it was responsible in the firm and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer he also the head of marketing , foreign sector , printing and finance .
Thus , for the first time , this is not a family member who is at the forefront of burda editions .
Children have burda respectively 19 and 17 years , her son Felix which would have today 42 years , died a few years ago .
The nommination of kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years '
Burda specifies that the 100 % holding must remain in the hands of the family .
The ruins have always held in families who have left causing by a capital bulimia , who have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher .
It has never been my strategy .
I have never been rêvede universal power , has said burda .
I do not consider myself absolutely not in the role of individual coach of countries like could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time , these companies have taken far too much importance .
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited , it is a device which can only look its electronic mail , without offering the possibility of even see some type of attachments or surf the Internet .
He tabled its five minutes of glory in the United States , where the magazine appointed as one of the products of the year .
In truth , it is more difficult to see him in the street , but the idea seems interesting , especially for young people .
Unlike smartphones peek , offers a price and a monthly fee very low , which is less than half the cost , for example , the data subscription iPhone ’ .
Given its success , the company has launched two new devices : one focusing exclusively on Twitter , the other with a free service of data for life , for six times more expensive than the peek .
Fonpeek introduced yesterday during the event the web , is the European version of the invention and its third embodiment .
It is equally limited than its American grand-frère , but with a surprise .
The price of its monthly fee , approximately EUR 12 , includes the roaming throughout Europe .
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what represents the abandonment to data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the WiFi ( or a connection to fon ) to consult its letter .
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly exciting and this is long overdue , it should operate .
Indeed , some operators have special agreements and options journey , but personally , I would need to have made a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print .
The repeated references to the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe had a barely discernible effect .
Outside their country of origin , people hesitate to use the data , and it was not wrong .
Only a small aircraft as fonpeek ( it is always curious that it drew fon even though it lacks the WiFi ) offers this type of tariffs , means that operators are starting to think differently and are studying various proposals enabling them to make their data network .
Kindle is another good example , it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet .
Without subscription and without soup .
It is a device connected and it pays during its purchase and not every month .
And that is what I hope to see a day for the fonpeek : a purchase option with access to life as peek proposes already in the United States .
Not that I wish to buy it .
I look at my mail on my phone , thank you .
I would simply because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer .
It would be interesting to see a computer introducing the same system .
The colour favourite Michelle
Yellow is , without doubt , colour preferred the United States first lady .
If they went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a mantle of this colour , it has , indeed , chosen the same to accompany the second time , undoubtedly , the most important of his life : the surrender to Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize .
Michelle Obama was a model very similar in these two occasions : in addition to their colour ressemblante , a yellow drawing towards green with brilliant reflections both those holding consisted of three parts : the dress , jacket and vaults , in the same tissues , and watch was a great embroidery or a Collier .
So that a first glance , it seems that the United States first lady follow the wake Princess of Asturias and chose to deliver the same held .
But the fabric in which are carved up the two sets makes them very different .
If the assumption of office , it was a delicate manoeuvring thick , however , it was a printed velvet in Oslo .

75 % of working mothers had problems because of their maternity professional
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers .
That is what betrays study " fertility and professional career women in Spain ' , conducted by the csic in collaboration with the Instituto of women .
The inquiry , carried out on 9 737 women from 3 to 75 years , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of motherhood .
The study shows that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life couple and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and the type of employment occupied .
Those who do not have work outside the home , part-time work or have a stable , are earlier in couple , have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children .
However , women with stable employment , mainly in the public sector , rejected entry into marriage and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children .
Women between 35 and 49 years having a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having installed in couple . This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the private sector . " these data show that women having stable employment were need more time in their lives to obtain one , which has led to the postponement of the Union and the arrival of children .
Moreover , the type of employment exercised influence widely motherhood but less the start date of cohabitation ” , explains the researcher of csic Margarita Delgado .
The level of study is another factor which is widening the gap age of marriage of women and their first child .
According to the investigation , the higher the level , the more they marry and have their first child late .
The difference is also maintains among women of the same generation .
For example , in the group that between 35 and 49 years , those with a basic education and higher respectively been mothers have for the first time 25.1 and 32.1 years on average .
" another distinction also appears among women , depending on their level of studies .
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding stable employment , those with a moderate level of studies higher or reverse this programme and give priority to the middle-way stable work as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child , " said Mrs Delgado .

A cowardly aggression
Last week , my mother , who had approximately 70 years , was walking in our district of the city of fuenlabrada , when a group of young people between 15 and 18 beat up alongside it and our dog , a sang-mélé , saved the SPA and not weighing more than six kilos , and without saying word , they assenèrent two legs who grew the dog seriously injured .
Our indignation is immense because we do not see this as it has amusing to attack a free small defenceless animals which , moreover , was in leaves .
To this we must add the indignation of a lady strolled quietly and which , when it injuria these individuals , in Arriva fear for his physical integrity , since a énergumène who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , an old or , ultimately , everyone lower than him .
The episode was held at around 5 p.m. , a Tuesday as another , in a quiet usually neighbourhood .
The dog has gémi all day .
Of course , we have lodged a complaint to the Commissioner the neighbourhood even if we doubt that it serves little and not to touch the sensitivities , we simply want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards .
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact .
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they find amusing abusing a free defenceless animals which gives us affection , friendship and keeps us company .
We do not know what has happened to the good education and respect for animals and people .
Michelin and fesvial , sets for the helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin , in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety ( fesvial ) , has launched a campaign to encourage the helmets , mainly motorcyclist younger – as has been said today both structures .
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the helmets , since that is the only element of protection to avoid the head injuries , or even death , in an accident in two wheels .
Michelin has indicated that this campaign was drafted in line with his commitment to road safety , which ‘ goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer ” and asserted that it contributes to this objective by other educational actions and informative .
This new campaign of encouragement of helmets in two wheels , under the motto ' to be or not to be ' , will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 lay-bys motorcycles , in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination .
Finally , Michelin stressed that road safety " is a constant concern ' for undertaking , because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles , one of its main objectives is to develop always products safer .
The sale of light-commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years ago , the market light-commercial vehicles is beginning to see a little light at the end of the tunnel .
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , more importantly , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months to decrease , according to figures from trade union organisations manufacturers anfac and ganvam , that of dealers .
But we should alter the good news , since the reference to the comparison , the month of November 2008 was particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared with the previous year .
Accordingly , despite the new developments of last month , registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40 % below those of the previous year .
Since January , if we add all vehicles which falls under the category of light-commercial vehicles ( derivatives of passenger cars , vans , pick-up , light vans and lorries to lighter chassis ) 95 853 were sold .
The dark clouds affecting the most their request did not dispelled . Indeed , although they are also purchased by individuals , most procurement are made by small and medium-sized enterprises , who pay in almost 100 % of cases through external funding .
Thus , in addition to the restrictions involved by limiting bank credits , we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the economic climate is poor .
Faced with this situation and unlike private cars , aid for purchasing the 2000th have little used .
In addition , the self-employed individuals and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions which does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometre , can also apply , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
Yesterday , among ganvam again , you recalled the need for ’ s administration pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles ( trucks and buses ) .
The association of dealers provides a year 2010 similar to that which comes to an end , for which it calculates a fall in sales ( private cars and 4x4 ) of 19 % .
Aid for emergency braking is now obligatory
As has taken place with the anti-lock braking system anti-blocking brakes and as will take place with the ESP , stability control systems for aid to the emergency braking constitute a compulsory element on European cars .
They are already mandatory on the passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while newly registered for the rest of vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011 .
The measure , imposed by the European Union , aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if , by his way of proceeding , it can also help to avoid many staging shocks .
The emergency brake assistants is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through kick to given by the driver .
But it does not always maintains pressure until the end .
According to a study by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch , one-third of drivers involved in an accident did not slam on the brakes before the collision and half of them had not taken advantage of strength .
Until 1 100 accidents
The intervention of aid , in revancha , requires a maximum of brake system , reducing the distance whose car needs to stop .
According to a study of the EU , if all cars are equipped with this type of elements , until 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians are involved die needlessly each year .
This reduction would be even more important with the so-called intelligent systems popularisation of emergency braking : it calculates that a sinister on four injury would be avoided .
In this case , the vehicle of a system which , through a radar or a camera , detect obstacles and prevents the driver , in addition to act slightly on the brakes .
If the driver reacts , it aid by increasing the pressure on the throttle , if this is necessary .
If it does not react , and although the collision was inevitable , the device exercises maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise the damage .
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers from Opel 's Figueruelas plant ( Zaragoza ) have been warned by Nick 'reilly , the new President of General Motors ( GM ) Europe , that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 – , according to Javier Ortega , the US manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the relief package Opel .
Nick 'reilly , the new President of GM Europe , heard that each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned .
And this could mean that the final document , which will firstly subjected to workers and the governments of countries where factories , be postponed until early 2010 .
In contrast , among GM , it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days .
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer in order to take a decision as soon as possible .
GM admits be in contact with possible new buyers .
One of them could be geely , which also aspires to acquire Volvo , but the manufacturer 's candidacy Dutchman sports cars skyper , supported by the Group converg Russian , is increasing in importance .
Where there would agree with any of them , GM could sell part of Saab ’ s baic Chinese company .
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained .
Driving the Porsche boxster spyder
To design their last and valuable 's engineers jewel Porsche left the boxster s and have managed to amincir nothing that less than 80 kilos , leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms .
This has led to happen in the first place , the automatic roof which has been replaced by a sheeted roof manual , reducing of 21 kilos , to employ doors aluminium as those of the gt3 , 15 other kilos of less , to remove the climatiseur , 13 kilos , to reduce the shell of petrol of 64 to 54 litres , 7 kilos of successfully , to set up bacquets of sport , still 12 kilos , and with tyres slight of 19 thumbs , five kilos .
Finally , they have renounced audio system cdr-30 , winning other six kilograms and have replaced by the poignéesdes door handles in tissues , saving the remaining kilo .
Although the model also exists with the box PDK dual clutch , the test was carried out on a model to six manual transmission speeds , mainly on roads of secondary network of California , in the mountains , with particularly sharp tortuous .
Its behaviour cannot be described as other than irreproachable .
The decline of the weight does not prevent the car to drive on the soil with self-confidence .
On the contrary : it was recognized that we had not tested a model as small and light , at the same time guaranteeing as secure in bends , including high-speed .
This is a small athlete , capable of heat its musclesà small speed for the time needed , until we urged him to sprinter , slow , to recover and to push for new its engine …
It is out what we wanted to . Through its direction , also communicative that specifies , the car will do will indicate our hands on the wheel .
And it will do so with surgical precision .
Its engine at will
The v6 Boxer , with 320 horses ( 10 more that the boxster s ) is particularly successful and it can be strengthened with the option ' sport ' or through a system which modifies the engine rugissement , already used on the panamera .
The ability to quicken is brutal , whether in the judgment or in success .
The suspensions are firm , but not harsh nor uncomfortable .
The road that we have travelled with the boyxster spyder was quite weakened , but the car a well-managed nests the hair-raising .
Electronic assistants did barely a token presence throughout the journey , whereas in certain fro-ing we found ice in the early morning and gravel , later this morning .
Ultimately , a car ultralégère , more divertissantes to lead and which is much more than just a simple amendment of the boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010 , at a cost of EUR 70 831 .

The second quart-temps was in the same tone , but the team of alava chose the game and work within barac Eliyahu ’ , which was received by cheers and applause of return to its former home , to increase their advantage to the break ( 34-43 ) .
Teletovic already began to draw attention to themselves as the best golfer his team , with 13 points scored , although the ‘ least six ’ splitter assessment was already the suspicion that this night was never going to be the best of Brazil .
But in this game , despite the fact that they were on the right track in the break , nothing was played , far from it , and the team of avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that it is not so easily on the ground , and through the hands of Elias ” , they managed to enter the match .
Eidson and pnini contributed decisively to what the yellow took the advantage on the lights ( 50-49 ) .
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic , injured but far from dead , needed to pick up some clever actions to take the air , and that is when arises the submachine gun of Mirza teletovic who , with three baskets at three consecutive points and aid to English and ribas remit the score meter reassuring ( 54-67 ) , and that the premises managed to accentuate at the end of the third quart-temps ( 57-67 ) .
The team of avala walked out to play the just for the whole package during the last period and English and San emeterio ( 60-75 ) avisèrent that they were tired person their take what they have earned during the first thirty minutes .
Nevertheless , pnini y eidson , the best of their team , does not résignèrent and tried to support it since the line of three points ( 70-77 ) .
Despite this , and with splitter eliminated for mistakes , players to Ivanovic does not précipitèrent , advocated well , and although the Israelis have closer at the last minute ( 80-85 ) , the party 's victory was already up and running in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season .

The unicaja lost loudly in Greece ’ olympiacos and has given him the head of the Group B of the euroligue , during a match marked by the absence of unicaja ’ s players , especially in the game of procedure ( freeland , Lima and Archibald ) , which facilitated the Greek victory .

Brazil sets a date for the start of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for the favourite Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa .
The deposed President must abandon the diplomatic légation no later than 27 January 2010 , the date of the official end of his mandate .
Francisco catunda , chargé d ’ affaires Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras , confirmed in TV globo that ‘ Mel ” knows that he must leave the embassy , where it is refugee since 21 September , before that date .

Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring , during which asset inflation has been the dominant note on markets , uncertainty y arises again , which is not surprising , because it is their natural state , in an environment where agents take decisions on a future inherently uncertain .
The cure employed by the central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize debt by buying asset directly and indirectly providing liquidity at rates close to zero , so that financial institutions will buy assets to mobilize .
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets were virtually finalised , and without questioning their policy 36-year-old maverick liquidity , are beginning to put a bit of sand in the workings , as did the ECB , with their choice of one year next week .
Therefore , investors have doubts about the capacity of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery measures without heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums .
The volatility of scholarships and discrepancies business obligations have risen again , although they are very remote from the levels paranormaux they have reached at the beginning of the year .
States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected .
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States , Japan and Germany were shelters selected by investors , defiant an increase of differences between the countries in the euro zone and Germany .
Spain was scarcely affected by this episode of instability , but then Standard & Poor its threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain .
On the other hand , a bit of uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of moral hazard , attempting to new provoke a conscience-based issue among lesresponsables global economic policy having halted the destructive effects of seal the limitation of credit on the destruction of jobs , whereas what should be done is announcing a new action day graces .
However , the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between emirs to restore its place in power in the United Arab Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece .
A government that conceals a public deficit of elections , and a new government which discovers the pot in roses .
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso .
It would be entirely irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro country not to respect its commitments .
What is logical , it is that Ecofin has prompted the Greek Government to transparency and makes its citizens share the necessity of extraordinary measures to maintain stability of its public finances .
If , as we hope , we face an episode of standardization of transitional risk premiums , after some excesses in leading positions , this would be predictable .
In the case of Spain , while our differences of public debt is increasing to the extent of obligations by EU companies , nousn not to worry us .
If European disparities than ours shriveled and continue to increase , it would then of a Spanish idiosyncratic risks .
The Standard & Poor 's affair is an anecdote . When our leading indicators oblige most services studies to anticipate their recovery models and to scale up their forecasts for 2011 , with the OECD and the European Commission , returning to the burden with a Japanese model pourl Spanish economy , she did not augur very hopeful for their warning .
Again , this has all the air to constitute an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spaniards , even if at the moment " caution is the mother of sureté ” .
Sectors connected
President of Iberdrola , Ignacio Sánchez Galán , was the first to speak yesterday before the Sub-Commission from the Congress of Deputies , where is discussed these days energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades .
After his speech , which was followed by the President of gas natural-fenosa , Rafael villaseca , Mr Galán outlined to the press that he had spoken to the Sub-Commission at huit-clos .
For President of Iberdrola , Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030 , where nuclear power stations in operation today would remain open .
If that is not the case , the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000 .
By contrast , iberdola considers that for the next decade , investment should not be devoted to increasing production capacity , but to distribution networks and international interconnections .
From 2020 , the issue is changing and it will increase the power .
Its wager focuses on both gas plants that coal , mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and , above all , on renewable energies .
In this area , it considers that 18 000 MW of more are needed , with other energies ' support ' .
Galán , who believes that the bill of sustainable economy that the government has just approve is in line with what is announced his business , did not wish to tackle the Royal Decree to encourage consumption of national coal , which contradicts policies to combat global warming .
He says that there is ' a gamble clear in the long term ' in this direction , despite the one-off measures , as the President has termed Iberdrola ’ .
Nevertheless , Galán believes that decisions to invest , although they are located in the long term , should begin to be taken , because they put some time before we reach maturity and that a stable gainful framework is needed to tackle them .

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fighting for its first motorway in concession in Australia , market where it is already working as company manager energy and water .
The shipyard at stake is a tunnel estimated at $ 1 700 million altogether million ( approximately EUR 1 ) .
The French company Bouygues and the German company hochtief are its rivals .
A tunnel 5 km long in the Australian city Brisbane , on the East coast , such is the option to enable acciona from taking up residence in the country as a company of public works and concessionaire of motorways .
The town 's wish to have it to end 2014 .
After having chosen the public-private partnership ( PPP ) for the initials to complete the project , in the framework of Plan D case under the tutelage of erns & young , the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the shipyard and the exploitation of tolls .
Waiting for the presentation of their tenders in May next , investment planned amounts to a $ 1 700 million altogether million ( approximately EUR 1 ) and in the last phase collide three consortia , with a notable presence of European manufacturers .
The group called transcity is conducted by acciona , only Spanish company in smooth , and his associates are mdbs and ghella .
The first is one of the biggest Australian manufacturers , while the second , located in Italy , is one of the biggest European experts in underground .
Against the team of acciona , shoe the consortium Northern direct , with the presence of the British company laing O 'Rourke , the Australian transfield infrastructure manager and the group French manufacturer Bouygues .
The third and last consortium who has passed the test is lbrjv whose capital is shared between the leighton Australian ( subsidiary of German manufacturer hochtief , which states in turn the participation of ACS ) , another local enterprise , baulderstone ( ownership of the German group bilfinger Berger ) and the Welsh company specializing in public works , razel .
The Australian market infrastructure promises great shipyards and privatisations , but enter it represents a great challenge , whether it is by the way of acquiring a local company construction .
A strategy that followed the hochtief enterprises and bilfinger , already mentioned , in addition to their references Asians , and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector .
ACS has barely winning a place on the market by its participation of 30 % in hochtief owner of leighton .
Active millionaires
Acciona put on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector , on which already has a large presence through its work of energy supplier and in the sector of the desalination .
Among other assets , it has the largest wind farms park , that of waubra ( 192 MW ) to Victoria , and direct the consolidation of companies responsible elevating and manage the dessalinisateur of Adelaide , with a budget of EUR 700 million .
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergies for entering the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure .
The road toll underground , promoted by the Office of the city of Brisbane infrastructures and the northern link ( link north ) , is called upon to connect the motorway to the Western toowong peripheral path to kelvin grove ( see the map ) , by 4 km tunnel . It is the greatest existing project aimed at reducing traffic congestion in Brisbane .
The timetable set by the administration shows that tendering will take place during the summer 2010 and that the work begin in December next year .
Despite the fact that the road toll will be opened to traffic end 2014 , it is not intended that the project be finished by 2016 .
