The lower this time around is due to the drop in shares on Wall Street. 
Also here are expressing the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote from the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of the shares in Asia 
The shares of the stock exchanges in Asia on Tuesday, lived a tragic fall, but throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses. 
The index of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Hang Seng along their financial journey marked by nearly four percent, but later losses mitigated by reducing the decline in almost 2.5 per cent.

Interest rates in Hong Kong are on the same level as those of the United States. 
Americans should Lawmakers to meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system. 
Otherwise, it threatens to fall will be felt in other countries. 
Bathroom bloody actions of the U.S. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives rejected the American plan to aid the financial system to which they should spend 700 billion dollars (nearly about 12 billion kronor). 
Legislators, thus, ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support his plan. 
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy. 
On Monday, the U.S. actions lived a bloody bathroom and the main index of the shares collected the largest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell almost seven per cent. A similar drop in volume was recorded for the last time in 1987. 
The index fell as before but be announced as soon showed that the proposal for not leaving the assembly forward, the index began to fall freely. 
The congress is removed: The U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars in the bank 
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American system of finance. 
Your vote will take place early next week. 
U.S. lawmakers created a gap in talks on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion kronor). 
However, it is not yet won. 
The congressmen should tweak some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and it is voted. 
The plan helps the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
He said Sunday at the Reuters news agency, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and Banks of the Assembly. 
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate before Wednesday. 
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the first announcement of a psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market. 
Later, however, will reach the "disenchantment" because of the complex mechanisms whose help will reach the market also in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made great progress. 
We solve our dissenting views with regard to the form that should take the package of measures to stabilize the market, "said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday. 
Representatives of the lawmakers met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a final shape to fund the government. 
This should buy the mortgage finance company assets not sold to companies that carry heavy financial losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are about to close the convention on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the marketplace. 
It is still necessary to continue with the reorganization plan, but I think we are in it, "said Paulson. 
A signal for the Asian business 
The global financial crisis affects specifically in the stock market to fall rapidly. 
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything possible for Congress finally approved an agreement this Sunday. 
They want this business to reassure investors before the Asian financial market since they are the ones who are in the first time zone and where the Congress could influence the trade on Monday. 
But for now there is nothing clear about security when voting the two chambers of U.S. Congress and, even, if not stagnate in the last minute with a problem. 
Lawmakers believe they will be approved in coming days. 
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes. 
The total amount committed to helping the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush. 
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if I had the impression that the program does not comply with their role, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, from the previous 350 billion dollars. 
Bush praised the progress of the meetings 
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but the Congress can overcome his veto by a majority vote. 
Despite these changes, retained the basic idea of the program that was to win funding for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay off their mortgages. 
"We have worked everything. 
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "the Republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
Also, the American president Bush is satisfied with the progress of the meetings. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and who appreciates "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy." 
Limiting the contract shielded 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chairman of the negotiators, said that legislators decided on the responsibility of money from the program to protect the tax payers of its losses, closing a relief plan to finance planned. 
The new law should also curb so-called contracts for armored directors of the companies participating in the program, and created a committee that will take control of the Fund. 
This would direct the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard at it, and we have made great progress in the direction of the convention that will work and which will be effective for the market and to all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also has to help the owners of houses that have problems with their payments. 
The government would have to agree with the new payments that buys mortgages in order to lower the burden of monthly payments from borrowers and enable them to be able to keep their homes. 
Marek: psychological help 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist at Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea to take place but quite difficult. 
"And that's why we do not know what mechanism will be purchased and at what price the assets problematic. 
This will be decisive for the allocation of losses from the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week to server iHNed.cz on. 
That the plan would be adopted now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant. 
"Much more important is that, because members of Congress this week to agree on their support and give its approval before anything can be. 
This important psychological and agreement to be reached this approval is at the moment, most important, "insisted Marek. 
Fight a deadly weapon: the MP3 player against the cellphone. 
We advise you to choose as 
While almost all mobile phone plays MP3 files, MP3 player gets no calls. 
What seems clear that it is better to just buy the phone. 
Still there are sufficient grounds to allow only men to acquire the player. 
The choice depends almost in the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner. 
It will probably be difficult to acquire the most modern player to listen to it on the last album from Maxim Turbulence. 
On the other hand this kind of music products like CDs LP no longer go out, and in terms of quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying. 
If agolpan on their shelves with vinyl music art rock, jazz or blues, is probably dreaming, at least, with this type of player. 
This is the same with music that is on its way, that is, compressed music, simple - the music in MP3. 
And here there are categories of price and quality. 
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight billion crowns in a player, both as a lover of Pink Floyd unlikely to try the flea market for helmets to twenty crowns. 
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
They also decided the battery life 
Some of the best players get much more than just play music and even what even the most mobile. 
No apparatus today is as universal as the telephone. 
Faced with the most basic functions such as phone calls, send messages, you can play music and video, recording the two, has a better or worse gear up photography and can navigate. 
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and PDA will have in his pocket a small computer. 
This is a small miracle that no longer knows how to do a barbecue fridge and no television can photograph. 
The universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages. 
The more functions into mobile phone use before the indicator lights up the screen asking to be recharged. 
And music is one of the largest tragones energy. 
Few get mobile music more than ten or twelve hours, much less the majority. 
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher yield. 
Therefore, having in mind that the motives cheap does not play more than two hours. 
If in addition to this, above, called constantly consíganse yet, for more security, a charger for the job - this is also true for the more expensive appliances. 
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have, because even the worst hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load. 
Another problem occurs when you record music on your phone. 
Unfortunately only a portion of the aircraft has the universal USB connector and, furthermore, not all of them can be connected directly to your computer without special software. 
Of course it is possible to record music directly onto the memory card but only in some units readers can be connected without reduction for small memory cards that are used in mobile phones. 
As players, with one exception (iPod), you do not need any special software. 
Simply fill the device with music through the computer's USB. 
Most mobile players and create their own order in the music library as the artist name, title, album, genre or even as the valuation of the user. 
Some devices only show a directory tree structure similar to a Finder Windows, and some acknowledge both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
The player attempts to serve the mobile knows more 
For the election of a specific computer an interest by the resistance of the accumulator, for the memory capacity and the quality and type of sound output and, of course, for the comfort of their management. 
If you hear, especially as background music, then you will hear every day just for a while, as in the tram, then you simply reproducing any cellphone. 
What really gets virtually any mobile phone. 
It should not even be interested in the format in which the motive or the player playing the music. 
MP3 replicate it all, and virtually almost all the music that you will arrive in this format. 
Is among the most widespread and apart from him the absolute majority of the devices reproduce music in WMA formats. 
The least include AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod business). 
The best possible mobile also, for example, buying music online. 
Simply by visiting the mobile internet pages competent operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album. 
This service could be in itself a powerful argument for acquiring a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately the supply of operators is miserable and most are confined only to the themes of fleeting success of the radios. 
The prices are also not the lowest. 
However, in general, it is assumed that this way of selling music (whether by GSM, or Internet wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry. 
Most people always takes over a cell phone. 
Whenever you hear something you like, find the cellphone in his pocket, while the MP3 player is forgotten at home. 
However, it still depends on whether it always takes a headset or at least the Handsfree. 
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile but is at least an MP3 player. 
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobile music will be its price. 
The cheaper cost typically less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand crowns and can acquire a good walkman. 
For most of you will limit the absence of an entry for headphones classics. 
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, as phones equipped with an input of 3.5 mm. for a headset classics, costing up to fifteen thousand. 
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than his easy service. 
The players most simple - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - the handles really anyone. 
The minimum duties, handling similar to the current or previous tapes to the players is evident. 
It does not represent a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the Internet with mobile and therefore account for huge data downlink. 
By deciding what apparatus 
Even the cheapest mobile (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).. 
Even with the purchase of a card suitable reach the two billion crowns. 
But beware. 
The basic models are usually equipped only with a card of 2 GB of capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, iRiver or Emgeton. 
According to the capacity (a maximum of 2 GB) no need to spend more than 1,100 kronor. 
If it is considered among the most demanding music lovers miss the hand of the more specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and some Samsung). 
These devices have separate buttons for the MP3 making it as comfortable as a service on a single player. 
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile line stereos are nearly identical use as an MP3 player independently. 
The same service and same category in terms of price, about four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and storage (typically 15 hours, with a maximum output of up to 35 hours), the Arria most cited brand brings MP3 players. 
The first virtual operator and will arrive this year, the Czech Republic. 
Probably 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and our operators offer virtually all services as its partners in Western Europe. 
Yet here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper. 
Probably not going to take to arrive. 
That operators Czechs are among the most expensive in Europe, as we have in mobil.cz writing. 
The rest is also confirmed by the Office of the Telecommunications Checa (CTU), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the whole Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming rates will probably reach a paradoxical situation - for some customers for mobile operators to send SMS Czechs from abroad will be cheaper than if you send them from home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are kept so high compared with Europe? 
The answer is simple, lack competition that really wants to fight. 
Probably this will seem paradoxical, since we have three mobile networks and high coverage is over 100%. 
By contrast, mobile operators like lamenting that in the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
They also chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Pavel Dvorak, and said that there is no place in the Czech Republic to any other operator. 
It is perhaps true that for a classic with its own operator network and does not have too many chances (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator. 
Precisely the entrance to the virtual operator at the mobile phone market has brought a remarkable decline in prices at which the operators also had to react classics. 
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile to the market of Great Britain Similar voices were heard so much there as here. 
It was shown that there is room for this type of players and that they can succeed. 
For the rest, it goes too far to find examples. 
In February this year, we inform you about the premiere Mobilking virtual operator in Poland. 
Just after half a year, this operator to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator of the neighboring country. 
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the group Penta which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to concentrate on more specific target groups. 
In addition, to enable them to function effectively, they simply far fewer customers than a traditional operator. 
Do not carry relatively large expenditures on construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this kind of virtual operators usually emerge with low expenses - offer calls and SMS messages that cheap however, are often balanced by the tight supply of services. 
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half of cheaper compared to its competitors. 
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland may also be a good bet coup by a group nothing trivial goal. 
This operator is directed specifically at men. 
"A man chooses Mobilking correct - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say whether similar concept such as Poland could hook into our country. 
They doubt the spokesman for Vodafone, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for access by segments which are based on the majority of virtual operators. 
In addition from the point of view of supply of services is relatively saturated " 
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, say mobile operators 
However, it seems almost certain that if the Czech Republic will have a virtual operator that will not be Mobilking. 
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem too hopeful. 
Rather, it is launching Mobilking in other countries in our region, "he said in a telephone conversation to mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly affirmed that the existing mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely are not inclined to this idea. 
Quite the contrary, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition. 
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator since it shows the group GTS Nover that I would take a further step forward to become real competition for Telefonica O2 in the field of enterprise customers. 
"We have a great interest in it, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators. 
With some of them have made progress in meetings, "said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps flicker better times. 
It seems that, by unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly as early as the end of the year. 
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"At this time we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market. 
The Czech market compared with others is a very specific niche market. 
Until the present no one has approached us with some serious and complex project in this field, "he said to mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefonica O2. 
The specificity of the Czech market relate to other operators. 
The spokesman for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with the exceptional views of O2, added: "Until today we have not recorded any commercial project viable, profitable bilaterally, can continue to develop." 
He adds: "In the network of T-Mobile will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year. 
In this time we should already have on the table any contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon " 
Vodafone turns its attention more to meet the requirements to own a 3G license. 
Miroslav Čepický added: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of the distribution of costs and infrastructure. 
Precisely what we consider to be the largest contribution from the perspective of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on your phone. " 
Offices responsible - with operators nail and flesh 
The progress of mobile operators can be understood easily, but the entry of another operator would increase competition which would lead to lower prices and thereby to a fall in profits. 
Why then facilitate entry into the competition? 
When operators want to achieve something, they can pull the same rope, is the proof of this came when agarrón U: fon. 
Perhaps the greatest pressure to the CTU was at the entrance to U: fon by the company T-Mobile. 
Witness the public information available on the websites of the CTU. 
But now U: fon serves as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová adds this: "Besides, not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened up to fourth operator. 
In regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is natural that the entry of another player in the market would mean for him and above all for their great service requirements. " 
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously disappointing because of the absolute selflessness of the Czech regulatory body. 
This is not just about the position of the CTU, which unfortunately has no jurisdiction to intervene in bidding commercial, unlike Britain and other developed countries. 
It belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bids (ÚOHS). 
However, it expressed its typical stance in this issue. 
"The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile phone market would be possible after it closed an agreement on the rental of necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator. 
Until now no agreement has been closed since the supply of potential stakeholders rather was not sufficiently interesting for operators classics, "he added to our question Kristian Chalupa, the Department of Foreign Affairs of the ÚOHS. 
These statements made not surprised by the representatives of the operators. 
For offices must represent the interests of consumers is more than just a consideration, apart from it should be noted that nobody takes advantage of its market position. 
Especially when Kristian Chalupa added: "In the overseas where the virtual operators are working normally, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services" 
Obviously, the pressure in regard to the proper functioning of the market and falling prices do not fall within the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking dramatically throughout this case lies in the reactions that are dissonant from the three mobile operators. 
The question of whether this is a coincidence, is offered by itself. 
It is the same as the price of gasoline at the pump because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a tough fight for the competition. 
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way. 
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore does not have a corresponding rise of accountability in their actions in the marketplace. 
The tools necessary to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, missing, as well as telecommunications regulators, "he added to his reply Chalupa. 
The interpretation on the dominant position in the market is one of many trouble spots. 
Evidentemente existe un análisis de mercados relevantes elaborado por la ČTÚ según el cual las telecomunicaciones son desde el punto de vista de la licitación comercial un único mercado. 
In this type of market operators naturally none of the Czechs has a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer another vision - to create a virtual operator is always necessary to the agreement with the network administrator. 
And the operator of mobile telephony - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network. 
Therefore, in a particular segment should necessarily be dominant. 
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning that three operators of mobile amount of strikingly similar. 
The current complaints of stakeholders (Includes this society Nover GTS) show that in all negotiations with operators will collide with many similar impediments. 
Load the responsibility for the CTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications which the ÚOHS washes its hands around this issue. 
We have encountered him and in some cases appear. 
Unfortunately recently filed a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the expansion of the jurisdiction of the CTU in the field of commercial bids that did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
This must know perfectly well what the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere. 
Everything is going well, when no one looks 
At the same time, desapercibidamente continues to function something like an operator pseudovirtual that in the Czech mobile phone networks already exist quite a few. 
They are companies that put their own prices for mobile services, which, however, only a fraction are public. 
Usually these are companies that engage in multilevel marketing. 
Amway, Czech Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services. 
Usually only a few get chosen from the list prices of these companies. 
The magic is in the company, with respect to the operator, serving as a classic of the same corporate client, ordering a large number of SIM cards. 
As a client will receive special after special prices and other offers. 
The problem is that trading conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale. 
"If it is discovered that the cases cited as one could speak of breach of contract under conditions that could lead to the end of the collaboration with the given society," he replied to a question on this issue Martina Kemrová. 
But it is quite unlikely that one of its kind conducted by the mobile operator does not reach people responsible. 
Particularly in the case of the three companies named could deal with the thousands of customers. 
None of the operators is against this procedure. 
The activities of these companies get some gains nothing despicable, and at the same time - unlike the authentic virtual operators - in no way threaten their own marketing officer. 
Miroslav Čepický warns us of potential problems: "the law allows this kind of speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers. 
They also must accept that the SIM card in your phone is unavailable to its name so it can not dispose of it as an absolutely normal client operations. " 
That is precisely what he should appear at the CTU slightly strange. 
In addition a new question for the ÚOHS. 
If that is mobile operators setting their eyes on this type of procedure, why are blocking the entrance to the virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has enough power to detect this type of activity and whether it is not going to want to not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators who have no idea of this history and that its business conditions do not permit. 
When will we stop being the most expensive 
As already made clear in the text, the entrance to the virtual operator at the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in the price of services. 
At the same time, in virtually every country where there was virtual operator, operators tried more or less classical protect themselves from this outbreak. 
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of service, and so on. 
In the more advanced countries, however, have spoken at this time regulatory bodies and in either case but defended the operators to their customers. 
Either through formal or informal pressure managed to emerge the first virtual operator and started to appear with him more. 
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority throughout this case it happens as if it were a nail on fire. 
For our experience we can not help feeling that the confusion of powers in these cases they agreed. 
But let us not despair. 
If this information is that between racks is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches this land, then the Czech market of mobile telephony probably starts to move again. 
If any of the operators allowed to enter any virtual mobile operator will be difficult for the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of others. 
And maybe we'll stop calling more expensive than elsewhere in Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four presentations of the new Czech version of the official anthem. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day celebrations Czech officials presented the new recording Where's official anthem, my home. 
The new anthem recorded the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiri Belohlavek. 
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male and one voice to a female voice, one with Choir and other instruments. 
Of singing are responsible Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremie and Jaroslav Krček. 
On the server iHNed.cz can listen to the four versions. 
Belohlavek Czech national considers this song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
The Czech Radio said earlier that intentionally chosen for Solos representatively young singers with voices that are more expressive and popular. 
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then, too, with the Choir that was set in the diction so that the text was well understood, to have consistent," he said. 
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year. 
Where the song, my home rang for the first time in the year 1834 in the tables in the Theater of States in the Czech Fidlovačka original work of Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of Frantisek Škroup. 
He won popularity and the people endorsed it. 
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, in a natural way, in one part of the official anthem. 
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic. 
How to sound the "new" anthem 
The MHD Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip 
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of Prague Transport Company of the date on which the first passengers entering the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bond in their pockets instead of a ticket paper. 
This can be purchased at this time by almost a hundred thousand people who possess the card chip Opencard. 
Passengers can buy the bond of 30 days, 90 days and the annual (this will be valid from January 1 2009) and simultaneously upload it to your card in the computer chip and mobile carrier in stations Metro Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska Zahra, Kačerov and Luka. 
The bonds can be bought on the internet since yesterday in the pages of the carrier, www.dpp.cz. 
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people. 
Those who begin to use the internet as a form of commerce, can finally begin to forget about the sales of tickets in the subway stations, which until now had regularly drawn to queue for a normal ticket. 
The bond is purchased on the Internet, and the card you Opencard recharged in one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library. 
"In these places are available for passengers with a one-stop staff prepared to assist stakeholders with the purchase over the Internet and also with the reloading of the bond purchased on your card," said the spokesman for the project, Martin Opatrný. 
Apart from the library, it is also possible to recharge the electronic bond in the Opencard in automatic vending machines that are in some halls of a meter. 
How are these vending machines? 
They are red, to remind us of a chopper banknotes and travelers probably would have been set on them in subway stations Roztyly, Budejovicka, IP Pavlova, and Florenc Vltavská. 
"Now there are five in the city but at the end of the year should have eighty", Opatrný completed. 
The bond is controlled by the machine instead of the driver 
The use of the machine, which will be operational tomorrow, is simple. 
Just enter it in the chip card Opencard and the bonus previously paid will be charged only in it. 
The electronic bonds are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its vicinity. 
Ie all Bypass trains and buses numbered from 300 to 499 that use mainly the inhabitants of the villages of central Bohemia. 
"The trains assigned to the Prague Integrated Transport reviewers are equipped with a card reader that will help to confirm the validity of time and the area of the bond", and explained the control of the tickets, Filip the Drápal ROPID organization that sets timetables of public transport in Prague. 
The buses bypass their card readers are mounted in the driver's box office. 
Upon entry is necessary not only show the card to the driver but is also necessary to Opencard to accompany you in the position to do so on the side of the box. 
In doing so, the driver checks the validity of the bond. 
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier to apply this information to the driver," Drápal completed. 
Passengers who do not travel on the buses bypass and not remember when I was ending the validity of the bond can turn to vending machines where the cards are recharged. 
Here at the screen of the machine, they display the information on the validity of their document. 
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum 
Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that smoking was part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted from the card that is stored in the collection of the Science Library of South Bohemia. 
If we can not be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this desire went, presumably, some groups of Germans from the Sudetenland to the chairman of the U.S. in the year 1945. 
It is clear from the letters that are stored in a particular file and which today are stored in the Library's collection Science of South Bohemia. 
The Germans Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the land Šumava "- occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have misunderstood the situation and really want your word that the American units are coming to land German oppressors or not as enemies but as liberators" is written on the letter, signed by a "people bearing on the fate of Šumava his heart. " 
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia in the southeastern German presumably means - such as the Czech national character - a hope only in the brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president to take over for today and Šumava forever under a protectorate. 
"We can not believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants will hand over to a foreign state that oppresses and refuses to minorities and that absolutely is working with the victory of the Allies," is written on the letter. 
The reason the authors can not sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the "oppressors Czechs." 
If the U.S. president presumably strives on the idea of Germans Sumava, it would suffice to organize on lands Sumava a referendum on whether its residents want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage. 
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today's post-war history, we may sound a little child, according to some specialists aptly portrayed the Germans' expectations of the Southeast then. 
Although the Germans Czechs had to intuit minimally of which was to discuss its expulsion of the republic only a few admit this possibility. 
Some had hoped that the United States and Britain to negotiate the Sudetenland any definite form of autonomy. 
Others are believed to be in Czechoslovakia. 
Confirms what even the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice. 
This was at war, as German Budějovice, enlisted in the navy in the Baltic. 
When at the end of the war it seized the British and deployed in the prison camp Holstein dozens of Germans went to him for that taught Czech. 
"They believed that to go home, the Czech could use them," said Chalupa. 
None of the prisoners Germans who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had it on the basis of the Benes Decrees would be removed from the republic. 
Do not think - you pay! 
Campaign emotional attacks on drivers 
The most expensive in Czech history led to safety on the roads. 
Thus one could describe the emotional campaign that launched on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport in the media. 
The office of the minister, Ales Řebíček promises that will deter drivers from dangerous behaviors behind the wheel. 
The campaign of 150 million will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and in leaflets. 
That would deter the driver of the high speed and drink-driving. 
And also to remind you that before you march care belts. 
Reach the consciousness especially of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and also in last place of professional drivers. 
And what we can see in the ads? 
Essentially human stories that embisten to the emotions. 
And for this we witness the ads "bloodthirsty" throughout the campaign: 
Do not think - you pay! 
The word "Do not think" it is written in large letters on the license plate. 
And in a puddle of blood is the word "pay". 
That should symbolize that the man at a time of layoffs could pay with their lives. 
The ads will "get scared" to viewers through 2010. 
The Ministry was left inspired by the campaign conducted in Anglo-Saxon land where you can see powerful images of accident victims. 
It promises that in that way reduce accidents and the number of road deaths Czech. 
The ads were developed by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"For the drivers the voucher system of sugar and whip. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, passed a red light and thus saves time. 
The whip is threatening to fine or accident. 
A driver must be remembered risks, "says psychologist transport of Na Homolce hospital, Martin Koran. 
And that is why it is necessary to an information campaign in the press and mostly negative publicity, specifically the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn drivers of danger. 
"If there is a panel installed to warn of danger probably soon will merge with the environment and the driver did not receive greater attention," said Koran. 
Olmert returned almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace 
The president of the interim government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the return of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, ie, West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria. 
He suggested in the interview that appeared Monday in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all land (occupied) if not all," Olmert told the newspaper. 
"Surely we will be left with a percentage of these lands, but the Palestinians have to give them a resemblance percent (of the land of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added. 
He admitted that if restitution would also include East Jerusalem. 
"One who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore not want tractors or bulldozers move above their legs as happened to one of my best friends, then you have to hand over part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which there were several deaths and dozens of people were injured. 
According to the president will have to find "a special solution to the hill of the Temple, the sacred and historical place" that is located inside the old city. 
"One who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate to 270,000 Arabs. 
This will not work, "he insisted later. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert also ruled by Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights which from their point of view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this would also entail some concrete efforts on the part of Damascus. 
"We do not intend to quit peace with Syria only on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan," he warned. 
"The Syrians are well aware of what will be required to divest to win the Golan. 
They must leave their current relations with Iran must abandon its relations with Hezbollah (movement cheetah), shall become detached from the ongoing support that causes terrorism of Hamas (Movement cheetah) of Al Qaeda (terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "concluded the prime minister. 
Questions after the accident: Are illegal hostesses in buses? 
The law is unknown, one can not walk into a long-distance bus 
In connection with the tragic crash of the bus company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova us the question arises as to whether the stewardesses and passengers can travel around the bus during the trip. 
"If we were strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity the stewardess is against the law for road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident resulting in the death last week, the hostess of twenty-two years, was obviously caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus was crossing the road. 
The girl, unfortunately, was seated beside the driver in the vehicle less safe place despite having reserved two other sites. 
However, the bus may have an accident or sudden halt, and at the precise moment when the stewardess distributes coffee or newspapers. 
Here it plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places to walk. 
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated. 
The buses long distances Student Agency does not have places to go for foot, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura to Aktuálně.cz. 
"We have settled with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed. 
This was withdrawn and finally arrived at agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom when the bus in motion if they have a seat, "told us their position. 
The flight attendant did not know the law 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this. 
Not even any laws prohibiting forwarding agents perform a service. 
The law of road transport only knows the end of Revisor of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined, "he adds, less adamantly, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the department of traffic of vehicles by road transport ministry, Josef Pokorny, think on the contrary that the law sufficiently addresses this issue. 
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed to have the approval of sites on foot. 
That's it, "he says. 
The buses are divided among urban, where there are places to stand and limited top speed, intercity sites to stand with a permit greater speed and long distances without places to go on standing, with the largest permit speed and with seats equipped with seat belts. 
As in the plane, says expert 
The expert from BESIP on Transport Safety, Jaroslav Horin, sees no major problems regarding the movement of the stewardess on the bus. 
"During the trip there is little threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on aircraft. 
Not even here we have the security they reach the turbulence and the stewardess who can hit in the head. " 
"However, if the bus suddenly slows clearly that the physical laws are valid. 
The same as in a city bus or tram. 
The security of the stewardess should fix the internal regulations of the carrier "She also thinks that from the standpoint of the law is without solving this problem. 
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service 
Student Agency is the only carrier offering the service of stewardesses. 
It uses it to two hundred. 
The principal, or after the accident, believes that job risky. 
"But by the time you have the impression that the post of flight attendant is risky, then deleted it. 
The coffee and newspapers may receive the passengers to enter. 
Even save costs, "he says. 
In the interest of security is the reason that Asiana has no stewardesses in their vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared with SA. 
"We do not have hostesses, we are against them from the beginning. 
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident, "he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz. 
It happened a great tragedy 
In the crash of the line linking Naples died at a young stewardess in Pilsen who had worked for the company two years. 
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using intermittent. 
His driver tried to avoid it in a quick maneuver, however, collided with the front right side. 
Jančura denied they were selling the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the stewardess. 
"These sites can not be reserved for connections over long distances, are blocked." 
The company's intention to sue the driver of the truck. 
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the family of the girl but also expects the financial costs for that portion of the blame. 
Reform of the law? 
No, for now 
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which a year ago that thirty experts are working members of a group of the Ministry of Transport. 
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion. 
Not too dedicated to buses, but rather to point system, maximum speed on motorways and the use of mobile telephones during the march, "said the expert Horin. 
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the hostesses something so important that threatens the safety of passengers," the spokesman finishing Hanzelka, that the control of security on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Security at work. 
The hope is based in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf 
In the letter to the board of directors of the bank West LB for their missing colleagues not big words. 
By merging units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank `DEKA can form a central market in the capital of Sparkassen finance group," as he said the letter, published on Monday 
The bank West LB, breaking the bloco `competition 'benefits with sustainable capacity to enter into such business. 
Moreover, such a merger could be a beginning for following mergers in the field of regional banks. 
So come to understand the text, when a board wants to show ability to act in tough times. 
As before, because the West LB is under enormous pressure. 
Not only the part of the European Union but also of the institute federal surveillance of financial services that recently has made clear the government of North Rhine-Westphalia left little time to find a solution. 
Already for some time, also on the part of Frankfurt, there is much talk about the union of this kind between the bank DEKA, that the customers of Sparkasse known for its investment funds, and West LB. 
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of Deka Bank, presenting the data after half years left at the end of August to know that you do not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank as for example, or Helaba West LB. 
But the board of DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed board to begin negotiations with West LB on common business activities. 
In this could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it. 
Of course, negotiations have just started and will said on the site financially. 
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen is the name of the bank that DEKA with 3000 employees is among the largest employers in Frankfurt financial site. 
In 2003, at a time when the situation seemed so that the bank could merge with the DEKA Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba. 
This initiative of creating a union of three parties was to no avail. 
Just the plans were made public, the government of Hesse was expressed against the participation of Helaba in this project. 
The other two banks also did not find the same language. 
Rather the bank's regional Rhineland-Palatinate started dialogue with the regional bank in Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
But they always played again with the idea of merging the bank with DEKA other regional banks. 
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of Helaba, said it was against the plans of coexistence with their bank. 
Independent of that seems to be clearer than the union of different banks in the field of public law is necessary. 
Well, when are going to move the elections of the parliament of Bavaria, the union's regional bank BayernLB with the Baden-Wuerttemberg could make progress. 
For Helaba this is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure further by merging rise, Helaba will be missing the Partners to do that. 
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, but until now much better out of the financial crisis that made him the buildings in Stuttgart and Munich. 
In addition the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year prevented the plans for coexistence with West LB. 
In any case remains the only Nord LB. 
But such reflections are geostrategic are just one part. 
In addition it is the compatibility of different banking models. 
In June Merl made a fundamental question about a business model that could secure the future for regional banks, to the deutsche Sparkassen-und Giro-Verband so far not given any response. 
In the end you can decompose the West LB, but this, of course, is not the bank's own desire. 
Thus, also in the charter of the bank's board is said to try to find a comprehensive solution for the whole bank 
As you can combine the unique coexistence between parts of the bank with DEKA, it's going to show time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
For Elena is the first time for Luca and the third or fourth. 
But this time, he attends Helena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything looks different, he said. 
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of beer brand is Kaiser built a huge tiger bear that shows nearly 200 participants from Oktoberfest know that sounds low to produce in his throat. 
First Elena Luca gives a pat, then a kiss. 
Bologna arrived in Verona. 
From there, the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova railway station, this evening at 23:45 leaving three buses, `direction Munich, the beer festival ', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning. 
Three buses are planned for the Italians, a bus is just for Brazilians. 
In one corner of the parking lot next to its flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to celebrate at night. 
With much noise, said Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians. 
A Marco, who is wearing a long coat with a lining of artificial skin and glasses with silver pins, you own these buses. 
For five years they come to Oktoberfest, taking into account that only three outings this year. 
At night on the way over there during the day in the meadow, a 2230 return. 
Spend the night there is just wasteful spending, said Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a beer that Kaiser was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German-Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt. 
Night buses are already on the way on the freeway with the direction of "Brenner" 
No beer, not yet. 
Quickly tranquility prevails in the bus, passengers are sleeping. 
Okay so, they still need the forces. 
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with enrollment Italian made another break in the highway shortly before 8 Munich. 
Finally, when the group of Marco is the expected arrival at 6.30 am in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already circa 50 more buses from all over Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the others are met, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed. 
First: wear a yellow hat. 
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest" next to the Gothic letters is the front page of the Office of voyages of Marco on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it." 
Second: "When you open the door of the shop of the campaign, that means go," shouts Marco in the morning. 
"Run!" Marching and occupying the sites back in the shop of the campaign. 
"Do not take the sites ahead, because we are going to block, and all with yellow caps do not sit on the same bench, scattered throughout space!" 
A liter of beer, Marco roars, it costs 8.25 euros. 
Do not forget the tip 
Show people the security that we have good tone! 
Very little comes out of your site, and he will be busy! " 
Third: "This afternoon at exactly half past ten that you get here!" Do you understand? 
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest. 
One, to mark the road, tying yellow hats on trees, traffic signs and even on a poster for the elections of a large Bavarian People's Party. 
Want to be able to recognize the way back. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
There are no accurate data on the number of people, it's about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormy fall into the tents, 10 per cent of all came especially this weekend in Italy. 
Police in Munich receives support from seven police officers of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers helped the Red Cross of Bavaria that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistances, in front of the British ( Nearly 60 assists) and the Austrians occupied the first place. 
The preferred store of the Italian campaign is well known Hofbräuzelt. 
The sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate 
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, only deepened last week the federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück. 
That well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking level will also be affected by critical trends. 
And that has happened after the weekend. 
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the financial buildings in Munich, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to make resistance to turbulence in the market. 
On Monday, a person who knows well the situation told Reuters: lending aid amounted to 35 billion euro. 
The share capital of the Hypo Real Estate will use interest has to throw. 
The money comes from private banks as well as those of public law. 
The cause of that are the losses of the subsidiary SDP. 
According to one report, the financial state with the money that was lent to the long-term projects funded only a brief period, so now, because of distrust in the markets, it is not possible. 
In the first half of the year the reserve bank's capital in cash has fall by 95 percent, 2.37 billion euro, the share of equity delayed a bit of a 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent. 
Compared with the same period of last year continuing earnings of financial investment and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the income of debtors and charging for certain securities also the dissolution of provisions in business lending tended to declining more than 70 percent, 5 million euro. 
Only thanks to high-income and many of reimbursement of expenses to compensate for the restructuring of ex-SDP group as well as reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and business corporations organized for the consortium, the balance could be negative acknowledge a deficit with about 16 percent more. 
After its privatization in 1990 the former financial state the principle was lost in speculation credits for industrial buildings, which served as the reason for founding the bank Aareal. 
As no one could make lots of money to finance state projects, the DEFA began to devote himself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and funding for community projects by private investors and state and (Private-Public - Partnership PPP) and diversified. 
Hypo Real Estate now has to make repayments on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of income group, says too loosely. 
It is a fact that dividends have been canceled. 
Already for 2007 were canceled for two thirds. 
After the acquisition of the SDP Hypo Real Estate became an important financial and financial state in the area of infrastructure. 
As the bank has no customer deposits, he, in comparison with other banks, turns out to be more dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market. 
With the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell mainly because banks were saving their liquidity. 
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance part of the DEFA loan portfolios of their short-term measures for refinancing. 
According to the report of Hypo Real Estate, the bank with a loan covering the need for the financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially not fit for work" 
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future. 
The central bank and the German federal institute for the surveillance of financial services (BaFin) start from the premise that the competitiveness of Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is guaranteed. 
That had to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record. 
It is even imaginable that there is no need to finance in full volume. 
But one can not exclude the case. 
The voice that ran in the last hour of Sunday, the bank was still nearly insolvent, so the temporary salvation can not reassure at least concerned people. 
The price action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros. 
The courses of borrowing, by contrast, are really good. 
While priority debts almost no change, the courses of borrowing as the position in the land register are clearly downward. 
Affected are mostly borrowings from the former subsidiary Hypo Württemberg and the reason borrowings whose maturities beyond 2009. 
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the SDP, which affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of their loans that were previously an investment for speculation should be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected yet ready to support the system, in the meantime we can start from the depreciation of pensions on time. 
Or something will happen, so do not imagine anyone risking-the financial crisis is overcome in next 15 months. 
But seeing the news on the cross partial nationalization, now that security is already at its limit became a hope justified. 
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, smashing his head on his decision on the isolation of enthusiasm. 
Even short-term investors can put the final point and use to new account carriage of the losses coming to tax payments of compensation benefits on change in the future. 
Sylvana and secrets of Bent?-Box 
When the first day Hiltrop Sylvana, 16-year-old girl, had to be submitted in Highschool Tachibana of the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "Kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana know the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she has Japan. 
"The first day at a school in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Even before he was afraid to go to college. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo and Kawasaki in the direction I'm going by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana. 
Couple had to find his way, fortunately I did not miss. 
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony. 
Of the eight o'clock the students come to the nine least twenty starts a small meeting with teachers, the 'home room'. 
Before the class started, I had come to introduce myself. 
Furthermore I am not a person who speaks with great taste in the public, especially before a class of 40 students. 
As they still have school uniform I was an old skirt of the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes. 
Well, well dressed to the pulpit and I tried to pronounce everything correctly in "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and within a week will be my birthday. 
At this time I was very happy because two years had begun to study this language. 
All 31 girls in the class have cuchicheado, and made signs and laughed all the time I heard the word "Kawaii" 
Already knew of my sleeves. 
That belongs to the vocabulary of Japanese survivor of girls and means "mona, linda" 
Then I deslicé quickly on my site. 
The girl next door had a big smile, for it was an honor to swap the girl had to sit next to her. 
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really attacked. 
All spoke at once, laughed and did lots of questions at the same time it is very difficult to understand English to Japanese. 
After the recess all took out their Bentos. 
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - is something that other boring bits of bread Germans. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and meat into something like mass of tofu. 
In most cases I have no idea what to like here in Japan. 
Things are rare and have a taste again. 
What is certain is that everything is very rich. 
Well, maybe with the exception of prunes marinated in salt, bufff! 
Japanese schools in the benthos were not just a lunch. 
Sometimes it happens that a girl preparing a bento done in a very artistic way for a guy and give it as a gift in hope of being able to understand it better during a recess. 
I read about it in my-Manga Comics. 
I am very curious to see if I can also see it here. 
"Why Japan?" I have asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a school year. 
He always responded: 
"Well, because it fascinates me." 
Finally, for years I prefer to read Mangas. 
In order to understand better the comics and culture, the day began to study a little Japanese. 
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I will travel there. 
Also because I have a great disservice by tradition and custom. 
Here they have a great value. 
A part of Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other side is a stringent, disciplined and traditional. 
Like everything is well organized, yet I felt lost here but Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life. " 
Rats also have feelings 
It is said that a rat or a cockroach flees feeling the danger, why has also scared? 
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neuroscience is convinced that many animals have feelings too. 
How can you control whether they, behaving in a similar way to us, they feel the same? 
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" many years since we released the contributions of famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents the answers in a series elected to the question: What do you think is really unable to test it? 
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or someone else could prove so far, although we can not even prove that other people are aware. 
But in this case at least we hope so because all human brains have the same basic configuration. 
But as soon as we devote to other species and include questions about the feeling in general and on the conscience, we entered into the field unknown because the hardware does not match. 
When a rat is in danger, does the same as the other animals: it is dead, fleeing or attacking. 
People behave in a similar way, what some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience. 
Of course I do not think so. 
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to pass our subjective experience to that of animals. 
First, they almost always include circuitry associated by the human lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in the short-term memory and executive functions that drive behavior). 
This part is much more widely developed in the case of people of other primates and seemed totally missing in other creatures. 
Taking into account at least the aspects relating to our conscience that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to suppose that even the man differs from the other primates . 
Another peculiarity is in the linguistic nature of man: Like most of his experience is united with the language, often that means that consciousness depends on it. 
In this case you can exclude the animals. 
But even if it does not depend on the conscience of the tongue, so that the influence of the consciousness of animals, howsoever created, in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals. 
If that, as interesting and somewhat subjective, nor let the measure because it has special hardware, nor is left to analyze through our experiences, and his research presents us with big problems. 
Most of my speeches concerning the content of lessons to, but at the same time there is also an aspect of consciousness that would be easier for research scientists. 
One could investigate the processes of consciousness of animals without considering their content, and that's what happens during the short-term memory studies of primates, especially in the instance of the display. 
But with this approach that still Christof Koch and Francis Crick essentially passes rather neutral correlates of consciousness that the causal mechanisms: The two may be similar or not. 
Curiously this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of the display. 
And what is it to the sensations? 
I have the fact that the emotional system is activated a part of the brain that is responsible for this, same as with fear. 
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind when we're in the activity of the brain occupies a space defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body). 
Viewed from this perspective the sensations are very determined to part of the cerebral cortex that distinguishes primates and especially to men. 
In view of the nature of linguistic classifications still feeling fine because we can distinguish and classify the states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the statements of others to pair ourselves. 
For example Antonio Damascus, by contrast, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the feelings of body and the brain stem, as does Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the trunk brains. 
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, we can absolutely relate to different types and their feelings. 
For theoretical reasons I can not go against it, but I think probably not. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel fear, possibly feel that in two cases also well: But how can control whether rats and men behaving similarly feel the same? 
Seeing a cockroach fleeing the danger, because it is afraid? 
I am of the view that the similarity of behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience. 
That is true that compared the neural help: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain. 
Is the trunk of the brain that is responsible for sensation? 
Even if it is possible to test for men: How can you prove it in case of rats? 
I think rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches (who knows?) Have feelings. 
But I do not know how you can try. 
I would rather investigate emotional behavior of rats that emotional feelings because their feelings are distinguished primarily purportedly from us (because the human refers to special circuits and language). 
In any case, here are expected progress in the field of neurology as measured by the same rats and men. 
Not investigated as language and consciousness of rats and sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
You could say that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move permanently to work without results. 
Well, I'm emotionalism practical. 
The chairman of UEFA's Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations undertaken soon under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister. 
"The government looks at the decision by UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in the ability of Ukraine to organize the European Championship together with Poland," said Wasjunik. 
"But that's not an amnesty for our country. 
Now the work is due to start in the two countries and there is plenty to do. " 
The hours of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame. 
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six. 
"We can not lose more time. 
Now we have to work with great speed, "said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA will not remove your eyes from us." 
In Poland was agreed on a more radical step. 
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The committee met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish news agency PAP. 
"In a letter we have assured the president of UEFA Platini that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that." 
Only in the last season many first division clubs were sentenced to manipulation because of a drop in the lowest category, ultimately split the council had to be postponed.

Get angry and fights back. 
The war behind the two roses in the ex-husband Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors show publicly a nasty quarrel between them. 
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan ruled for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful." 
She knew the size of his infidelity only after divorce. 
The reason for the disclosure of private matters was the work of Ryan with the press for his film new "The Women" - has a history of failure of a marriage. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction to the nomination of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "outrageous that Meg how many times has the history of our relationship in a different version," said the man in 54 years to "New York Daily News" . 
Among other things it is "regrettable" that Jack, his son aged 16, again "in public will remember the pain and changes, all of which means a divorce for a child." 
Ryan while living alone after divorce, Quaid is married and again recently is papa of twins. 
And so it ends with his statements emphasizing: "Either way my life goes on. 
I am happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine. "

In the Norwegian city prices for hotels increased to 26.3 per cent and beating a record in Europe. 
In the first quarter the price of airline tickets also showed upward trends: 
Because of the increase in prices of kerosene the Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in the year 2007, the long distance flights were made even more expensive up 29.2 percent . 
From April to June, prices of air tickets in Economy Class, compared with the previous quarter, fell on average at 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and FirstClass were small. 
In Germany the change in prices was more marked than in other European countries: 
From January to February prices rose to 11.9 in the second half fell to 23.6 percent. 
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved. 
The cause of the change in prices is a part of the increase in the weak economy, says the company. 
In many parts of the travel market with the aircraft demand is falling. 
In addition there is big competition for the Open-Skies treaty liberalizing the traffic of planes from the U.S. and Europe. 
The sign of the tense situation is canceling flights nonprofit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - just in Europe were 24 airlines. 
The HSV won 1:0 against Gladbach

Luhukay of Borussia it still does not come out to make the eleventh goal. 
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the national team player Marko Martin.

"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the entrance booth of the stadium in Hamburg. 
Do not pass anything special in the catacombs, the resting period ended and most of those present were again on their sites. 
Rieger was almost over three decades of HSV physiotherapist, enjoys great reputation as one of those that formed part of the group. 
That is why his application was noticed by a responsible person. 
Cornelius Jol with the assistant coach nodded his head and closed his fingers as a sign of assent. 
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the coach of Hamburg. 
Their order was the same: Oops, the second goal! 
But that was not done. 
"Today not everything was pleasant to see," he added after Marcell Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard also had hoped to have "more relaxed". 
The result 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with the impact of head, and also to the situation that the team of very weak Gladbach could not show all his strength to the weak team in Hamburg .

Anticipated that the ratings part of the table correspond more to the fickleness of the league that the dominance of its HSV. 
QUIPMENT the afternoon with his players obliged as the Brazilians and Neves Silva, the scorer Petric and that Jansen was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the QUIPMENT can not shine with their successes. 
"We need more of the feeling and dribbling," Jol demands.

Dark matter affects the trajectory of space probes 
For many years a phenomenon mysteries cause embarrassment to the researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver. 
Experts fear that the Theory of Relativity of Albert Einstein may not be as accurate. 
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe. 
Because of fuel pipelines that are now helándose him a death threat in the cold. 
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly in the gravitational assistance to the lift, causing bewilderment among researchers. 
The gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they receive an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, such as the Earth. 
That allows space probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens, the European space probe used this trick-American physicist and did the Ulysses probe of the Sun. 
But what surprised the researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave by 100 percent and it expects as the venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather frequent irregularities of speed. 
Unannounced probes have higher or lower speed. 
Physicists can not explain this effect so far. 
They called it the gravitational anomaly assistance during the maneuver. 
Some experts fear that even possibly the General Theory of Relativity of Albert Einstein that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space can not be so accurate. 
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes solemnly now as before that Einstein did not confused and tries to explain the anomaly in the gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in which astronomers were left in the universe. 
"The reason for this anomaly may be dark matter can also be very close to Earth," he writes. 
The researchers of the universe aware of the existence of dark matter since only ten years. 
Supposedly it has the force of attraction and its influence can be seen on other planets. 
Dark Matter, on the contrary, it is completely invisible which means they can not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists Dark Matter for at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe. 
The kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free 
As confirmed by the minister of foreign affairs of Italy, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the abducted tourists in Egypt should be freedoms. 
The kidnappers had demanded millions of Sudan's rescue. 
Six hijackers should be killed in a shootout during the release. 
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt. 
The negotiations already started with regard to the rescue. 
The Germans always fall back on the point of attention of the hijackers. 
The newspaper WELTER ONLINE tells about the most important cases. 
It appears that European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are freedoms. 
About the same information that presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media. 
After the news about the release on the radio station Sky TG 24 Italian Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of foreign affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens are hostages and other freedoms. 
'Now we control the state of his health, "said Frattini. 
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and his eight companions Egyptians are well and are in safety, Egyptian state television reported. 
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo. 
What remains puzzling is why a shootout before the release of hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers. 
"The problem was solved. 
They were in agreement with the rescue, "said the guard. 
It was just "receive the hostages' when suddenly came" this surprise. " 
On Sunday, the Sudanese troops have killed six hijackers and two of them have been arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt. 
The kidnappers have demanded the surrender of Germany in the amount of six million euros, the money needed to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The newspaper El Masri The JOM, "referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety. 
According to the report, the kidnappers had intended to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom. 
The men had to stay in detention until the hijackers had a safe route to flee. 
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report. 
Abuse stepfather "has led to suicide" 
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather took a woman to kill herself. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault. 
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly strapped to his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for his death." 
The court heard that Mrs Randle committed suicide at his home in Mutley in Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34 years. 
In the season where the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used atarla and blindfolded before carrying out their sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub. 
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth. 
However, the court heard that Mrs Randle, who spent much of his time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse inflicted upon it twice a week. 
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had told her that after a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if he had "given up on life. " 
In April 2007 his real father, Terrace Randle, he found the woman dead in her apartment in Plymouth. 
It is assumed that Mrs Rande has killed herself suffocated by a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle confronted the stepfather of her daughter, who wrote a letter of confession which concludes by saying: "I used to atarla and selling the eyes. 
It was never a sexual assault. 
I feel responsible for his death. " 
The judge Christopher Elwen to Trerise replied: "You are a very strange fetishist, and his victim must have been a frightening experience, especially when he was only seven years. 
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim takes his own life. 
Even more clear is that if she had not been done, probably would not have ended the matter in court. " 
He added: "I noticed the effect that according to the description given by the father and the mother of Stephanie abuse had on her daughter throughout the years. 
Clearly it would have been able to have a promising future, success and happiness. " 
An officer charged for data loss 
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act. 
The man, traveling for work by the Ministry of Defense, left highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo. 
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to police. 
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of criminal intent. 
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner for the Defense said that the sentence had come as a surprise to many in the British administration. 
"They thought that it is an internal matter between the MoD and the Cabinet," he said. 
The employee, who can not be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information. 
The Service Real Juric said that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, due to the highly sensitive body of his work in the Committee of Secret Services. 
The documents containing secret information forgotten about Al-Qaeda and the ability of the security forces in Iraq. 
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then moved from home to a secret location. 
The building societies face the price of B &amp; B 
In Britain the building societies could face a price of more than 80 thousand pounds after the rescue / rescue of the bank Bradford and Bingley. 
The Government, in effect, it provided 14 billion pounds to protect deposits from 2.6 million savers in the bank. 
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money savers, including the 59 building societies. 
The director general of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, as "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay 
Eventually, the loan of 14 billion should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed. 
However, the interest that accrues in the interim, we are supposed to be loaded each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits. 
The Compensation Scheme of Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies were included in that number. 
It is humiliating that institutions behaved with prudence ... Call today are paying the price of the institutions that have been far less cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
That means that each firm had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and the companies that mediation had to pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 billion pounds in 2009. 
This means that companies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds sterling to face the first year of interest. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Building Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair. 
"It's humiliating that institutions behaved with prudence in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were far less cautious." 
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any company since 1945. 
"We will have the need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect the building societies and their members in the face of what could be a significant price," added Mr Cole. 
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until this March. 
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as much. 
Being the mutual building societies and organizations having no shareholders, its members inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher taxes or lower interest on their savings. 
The milk price rises of five per liter Pence 
The inhabitants of the podium of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk. 
The daily Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five Pence liter from next Monday. 
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two Pence in February and followed investigations carried out by a consultancy firm. 
Merchants can decide for themselves whether they want to implement price increases to their customers. 
The last time the highest price of milk had increased by February, was in 2002. 
Denied bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh 
A Bangladeshi court has rejected an application for bail to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that it can be taken to jail when he returned to his country. 
His defenders said that the court not granted him bail, accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($ 729,700) to a businessman when he was Prime Minister. 
This is one of several allegations of corruption at his office. 
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month. 
The return of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, supports militarily, the first granted full freedom. 
Correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and get some medical treatment, it is unclear now which are the terms of her release or whether she will be able to remain at liberty when they return to Bangladesh. 
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court. 
"The Supreme Court rejected the petition for bail to Sheikh Hasina arguing that it could not get bail because he was undergoing treatment abroad on parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq. 
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court." 
His defenders argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and to prepare for the December elections. 
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after the Oct. 17, who spoke as a leader of the Awami League on Sunday. 
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, took power but was released in June to go abroad and get some medical treatments. 
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia rejected all charges of being indicted. 
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan 
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - said the UN - have failed to seize the podium of a recent campaign of anti-polio vaccination because of the violence of the Taliban. 
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination program in six provinces in the country. 
The organization reported that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons. 
A spokesman for the UN said it occurred in spite of the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or blocked thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations. 
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV 
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission after the ruling that forced the company to reduce its involvement in rival ITV broadcasters. 
BSkyB has been advised by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that will have to reduce their share from 17.9% in ITV to below 7.5%. 
Above, the Commission said that the interests of BSkyB impeding competition and allowed its influence on ITV unfair. 
BSkyB bought its package of shares in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked to NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV. 
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that the acquisition of participation in ITV by BSkyB armed doubts about the independence of ITV, and drove to the Competition Commission to open an investigation. 
Everyone, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase. 
BSkyB said that the forced to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, especially why, BSkyB said it would have surrendered their voting rights. 
New research on ownership of the U.S. attorneys 
The Attorney General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006. 
The reason was a report that the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the actions by officials of the administration. 
The report criticized the White House officials, lawmakers and former PRODUR General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons. 
The Special Attorney Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice. 
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," the Attorney General Glenn Fine said in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to give their statements. 
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006. 
At that time, the department prompted the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance. 
But later it became known that lawyers had not been rated worse than other colleagues, many observers and led to the conclusion that the dismissals were motivated by political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the prosecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud against Democrats. 
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government 
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons. 
The future head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the dismissals, resigned his position. 
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same. 
Attorney-General's report is highly critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales on the issue, and stressed as he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissal that "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "no collaborative significantly" in the process. 
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former associate of Bush, were criticized for not having cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic of Meat Loaf very honored 
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said that obtaining such recognition will be "an honor". 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with Meat Loaf who triumphed in 1977. 
The group Coldplay are leading the nominations for the awards this year and making the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them." 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability as that was used by Meat Loaf. 
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opened the anthem. 
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking. 
However, Bat Out Of Hell by Meat Loaf stayed about nine years and went on classifications to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide. 
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel several concerts. 
Subsequently emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal chord. 
Dark city street, often forgotten and might prompt the sale 
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and roads, some famous, others simply service. 
However, many people, even veteran taxi drivers and local residents of long standing, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street. 
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North First Street - before I found the Secondary Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue. 
This street, more or less than 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty alley of a more active way. 
There are no signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas. 
The street, however, has admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the company has recently constructed buildings of luxury in the First Street 
who wants to repave Extra Place and create a corridor to clean the stores and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include the old neighbors who commented be delighted by the lane truncated simply because it is one of the last remnants of the last block before the seizure of buildings. 
However, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the streets, has no interest in possess. 
At the meeting of the Commonwealth of Vencidad for land use that took place this month, representatives of the agency Avalon outlined a proposal to buy the street. 
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, district manager of Community n.3. 
"The city now owns very few spaces and we would like to continue owning Extra Place," said Ms.. 
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street." 
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small streets and installing some seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hopes of renting spaces. 
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first arose during the meeting this month 
But Michele of Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, not necessarily wanted to possess. 
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for the Preservation, confirmed that there was a desire for the city to sell the street and noted that the mission of the agency is the property development rather than managing this. 
Compared with its surroundings more than color, the Bowery, Extra Place has made a mark on history. 
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the vast estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone. 
The rear door of CBGB, the punk rock monument which closed in 2006, was in abriba Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that leaves on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia". 
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976. 
"He was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes." 
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, which are still modest, should remain public. 
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a sliver of the city that should be supervised. 
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: Bitterly A Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a speech in the history of City on Extra Place, published by the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow alley and a little sac, too dark for the day and marked by store doors and anti-oxidized iron windows with old newspapers for weeks blown along guttering. " 
With few exceptions, the streets seemed more or less the same on a recent afternoon. 
A rat is Curía through the back side of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store. 
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers. 
Some interns said they rarely put attention on Extra Place, but suggested it could give you a cleaned. 
Mr. Fields, for his part, noticed that some people underestimate the power attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark places, wet and filthy." 
The debate over bilingualism: language immersion English 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the candidates' positions on bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, an old partner in the California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice." 
Call effectively to Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals on education made by Barack Obama is an example of that. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama notes that "Afro-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate to white students," and this is a very true. 
To combat such differences in the occurrence of learning, the education plan specifically calls for Obama, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-learners. 
But the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, who prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, to be effective in nullifying the distance in the final results. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the eastern county of Los Angeles. 
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families: 
More than one third of the students, many of them newcomers, are learning English. 
However, an incredible 100 percent of the students in the fourth year, has been evaluated positively in the math test, 2008 
and almost equally amazing 93 percent have mastered the test of English language and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient that favor by Mr. Obama. 
The school emphasizes the Sixth Street review and practice the assessment of skills and attitude does not tolerate any excuses. 
In addition, and this is where Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the focus of the school for the instruction of English to students is in "total immersion". 
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of language in dealing with the content of the instruction. 
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, he said, "We have had extraordinary success with students as the latter has come from Mexico and that if they walk into the classroom 12 months later would not be able to collect what it was . " 
"It works," he said, "we believe that works." 
¿Mr Obama will take a Sixth Street Prep School as a model for replication by other schools with large populations of Hispanic students and English? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of politicians from his party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and the same continuing support for bilingual education dark predicting the response of Mr. Obama. 
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people should stop worrying about the legislation is written only in English 
and instead of that, he said, "you must make sure that your child can speak Spanish." 
If indeed Mr. Obama wants to improve the system and close loopholes, you should carefully consider education models that work well, rather than trivialize or despicable. 
The price of oil fell sharply after the renewed economic fears 
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the American plan to rescue the financial markets may not be able to revive the economy. 
The actions of crude oil fell 7 percent to reach 99.80 U.S. dollars a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has fallen from over $ 20 a barrel since last Monday. 
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching its peak of 145.29 U.S. dollars per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $ 90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before falling back once again because of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets. 
The anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from over. 
The developments occurred in the last episode of the merger process, confirmed that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, as the government said Monday. 
Meanwhile, governments Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the surrender agreement "does not seem to have been able to revive the market sentiment." 
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected in a recess in demand for commodities, including oil. 
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange will be increasingly uncertain," wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank in a note to investors. 
"We believe that commodities can not escape this contagion. 
From the perspective of products, our most pressing concern is to assess whether the virus will spread to American world and specifically to China. " 
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, as lower oil consumption because of the crisis on economic growth and anticipation of a reduction in the price of oil and gas is about 20 percent by 2009. 
Second quarter of insanity: Team sets record 
After all, during the past eight seasons, longer than anyone in the uniform of Jets, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen it all. 
Then he saw things develop in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned into a game without recording a game deflate. 
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis. 
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness in the dark of clouds. 
At this time happened to the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal from 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon in which the evolving relationship between the players took a great leap forward. 
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell down and another came with 10 seconds in the half. 
"I do not got out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were to Coles. 
"He's a hell of a player. 
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people might think. " 
While Favre and Coles were performed in the dam, defending the Cardinals mistreated the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrell Journal intercepted an errant throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith point to another pass and intercepted it. 
Lineback David Bowens was forced by the lack Warner. 
In the last turnover, forced by the misconduct Bowens, could have been the best. 
The Cardenals took possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a kick 20 yards to win a 34-0 final. 
Points are greater than the Jets never did in fourth. 
The A team coach, Eric Mangini, ask to describe the madness of the moment, said: "The second quarter or third quarter?" 
When he answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked much more the second quarter that terzero. 
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time. " 
Gebrselassie rested their heads world record 
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown that many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the race easygoing flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has shattered by 27 seconds the previous record of 2:04:26, achieved last year in Berlin. 
At the age of 35 years, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race with a length so impressive that it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the race against up to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in hindsight - that the Air Pollution escalate their problems with asthma. 
Instead, it was pointed out to run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average about cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile. 
Since when Gebrselassie as brokers track and Paul Tergat of Kenya have been converted to long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06 : 05 in 1998. 
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and had lost a week of training. 
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty. 
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I started again a week ago, and today we had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine. " 
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the rival Afro-eastern Ethiopia - in the style of orchestrating their careers too, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the marathon world, based on the pacemaker as if it were having a race track, and putting the record ahead of a sense of competition. 
But that criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner. 
This Sunday, the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie achieved half of the race in 1:02:04. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his pacemakers dropped. 
But shortly before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie grabbed a last push to secede from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving her personal best record by nearly five minutes. 
Kamathi came to third place in 2:07:48. 
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14. 
She also took part in the Games in Beijing by what was described as an injury to his back, but recovered to win in Berlin and his personal best record in nearly five minutes into the third marathon that he ran. 
He made a career of intelligent calculation, leaving a quartet of brokers Ethiopians and Kenyans do headaches, and then recover after 18 ½ miles. 
Askale TAFA Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01. 
In a separate city, pride and evidence of the life of color 
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park to the big Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of African-American experience are very evident. 
Eatonville, the first town built entirely inhabited by blacks in the country and place of children of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison. " 
It is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair to be taxed at Eatonville tribute to Ms. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet, in many ways, the city that she described - making it a tourist stage by inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project of the season for depression - remains a place apart . 
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 30s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resistive to share their ideas with real white man who "knows so little about us and he does not know what was going to lose. " 
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to begin a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the stranger. 
"We are very cautious about how it is our history," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city. 
"You have to be correct." 
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle. 
At the same tempo is a historical model of the affirmation of black and a community of nearly 2,400 people who live under a poverty level twice the national average. 
It is a literary center, but also a good example of the culture of southern rural black - sometimes disdained, others praised - who was born of slavery in America. 
Not surprisingly, whether residing here are both proud and reserved. 
AY concern for the image of Eatonville actually started by Zora, as nobody calls him Ms. Hurston. 
She introduced her hometown to the world through its profound books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the Guide to Florida transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the center of the Florida often forgotten inside the history of blacks and the human drama. 
Taking side with cement both in life as in literature, Ms. Hurston took his readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, then the inside more private areas. 
"Outside of the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern public school signed with its white finish, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write." 
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and Glenn Lee writes that "sells all kinds of drinks and anything goes with transient rooms." 
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston Eatonville to connect with the self-government, but also with illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. 
Obviously, this Fodor did not. 
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described him as it were," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls that Mrs Johnson Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing songs about their beauty without color. 
He added: "Some people did not like that." 
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Franklin Augusto, 77 years, recalled that when Ms. Hurston arrived in town, he did not notice a big Chevrolet, smoking and leading pants in a city that still takes pride in dressing with dignity. 
Most residents stayed fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically. 
"People are always glad to see a lot of Zora," he continues. Franklin. 
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long." 
When Ms. Hurston died in 1960, was poor and his books were no longer in stamping. 
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her. 
Although he was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 20s, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had been living. 
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, or large public readings. 
"I do not believe that his or her contribution to the world heritage were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003. 
A true turning point came in'80. 
Officials in Orange County wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street of the working community. 
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed the Interstate 4 across the western edge of town. 
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
The forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community. 
In the 50s, the struggle for racial mixing led hatred on the community. 
"During this season, a group of white guys, are going through the city throwing oranges and every thing against people who were sitting next to it," said Mr. Franklin. 
"They killed a girl too, once. 
He was fired against a watermelon car. " 
In a letter from 1955 to Ms. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honoring my race." 
R Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people. 
"The children were accustomed to be hugging black - I remember this - was used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said NY Nathiri's daughter Ella Dinkins and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, an organization not-for - profit. 
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came not from the same place. 
"There was hugging your teacher because she was white - there is a cultural gap there," said Ms. Nathiri. 
Civil rights, however, helped to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists that went beyond prejudice, as did she, with a buoyant, confident and lines like: " How can one deny himself the pleasure of my company! 
I do not understand. " 
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the unmarked grave of Mrs Hurston and began fighting to resurrect his reputation. 
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Ms. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroduced in royalties Americans. 
The road project came just at the time the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the spotlight. 
And this time, the old neighbors of Ms. Hurston saw as a savior. 
In 1988, the community started to plan an exhibition for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin this road. 
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many returning for the celebration. 
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed road. 
"The idea resurrected from the road to five channels, it would have been put into what you call speed curve, a true civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri. 
Ms Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory on the road project has helped change the image of the city. 
People from outside Rachelle city like Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past. 
Eatonville entered into the National Historic Register in 1998. 
A new library (under the name of Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on an embellished repave and Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: to just six miles from downtown Orlando, may at times feel like a street under a rain of last summer in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s. 
(90 per cent of black people is today.) 
Outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, their meaning, are often still treated with caution. 
A An Advance permission is required to make the most of the interviews, and some things - like the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - can not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a courageous and confident teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still afraid that their community gives island can be misunderstood. 
And yet, like Hurston festival has been expanded, it has also emerged a higher level of hometown pride. 
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville the same way as Ms. Hurston saw his entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and to all other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative , Hardworking, dumb and mixed. 
It is a sincere civic sense which can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who planned to go back to Eatonville after college to work in local government or by the Police Department, which said might need some help. 
And even those who are younger, as Alondra Kenon and Alexia, two twin 11-year-old from Winter Park, seem to have learned how to correctly describe Eatonville. 
"Most people, if they dare to go this far, they have to think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to any other'," said Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday. 
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, is a very nice city." 
For here in New York, all fluent in finance 
On the surface, nothing has changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan were kept away from newsstands and the giant television screens in Times Square, they would not mind being in the eye of the hurricane. 
They could never imagine that behind the facade of glass offices honeycomb that are above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are faced daily with the worst "bad day the office "from the downturn of 1929. 
Guys for home delivery continues to resonate their metal carts for tea across the pavement and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings. 
Latino men still dragging borne between apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 shirts eccentric stamping colgandas a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still waiting in queue for take-away in the morning, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the evening on weekdays. 
Employees still waiting for his bagel queuing up to the carts of vendors, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the day of the week. 
It seemed as if there was a crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there is, I have decided to open a new savings account. 
Although he had calculated the time required for the operation coincided with the calm of the end of the evening in my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people already waiting. 
And not in front of the window of the employee, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the bank's customer service, where customers order their whole life check, tourists looking for instructions to go to the Department stores Macy and new clients want to open their accounts. 
Most of these people have preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my "personal banker confidence," and were in queue for the same reason as me. 
Unlike me, yet, had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from where they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
They had their money taken out of the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), from credit unions and savings banks in his home town whose white only operate within the state of belonging, and they say treat to the customers as to his family. 
During the past year, 15 of these banks have failed silently. 
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $ 327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers were heading toward their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with deposits saving $ 440 billion, went looking for a buyer to rescue. 
Workers at offices and stores that stayed in front of me, fearing another collapse, they were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is making the most of the rescues on Wall Street. 
Ordinary people of New York have become experts in recent weeks of finance. 
A Chinese woman in my local supermarket, talking on the phone, dealt with Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and his gaunt appearance CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about the inactivity of a colleague. 
And Lyn, fifty-something and uniformed doorman of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the shopkeeper. 
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds. 
The switch is made, I am not taking any risk. " 
Muslim tombs desecrated at the time that Austria is close to the right 
Heinz-Christian Strachan, the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, member of the far-right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp , On Thursday January 17 2008. 
Carry traffic signs representing the mosques crossing a red line. 
The police are blaming a few extreme right-wing extremist for having desecrated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend that the political parties of the extreme right made huge gains in general elections in the country. 
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged in the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action. 
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, like the Star of David on some of the graves, but the researchers think this may have happened by attempting to hide the real motives of the extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants. 
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply wrecked" by the news of the desecration, which came to the Muslim religious month when Ramadan was ending. 
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing a round of soul-searching after the shift to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two far-right parties which accounted for nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign in the hotly encentrada anti-immigration and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics. 
Heinz-Christian Strachan, the leader of the Freedom Party won more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against head scarves and burkas, and also expressed its opposition to food considered related to Islam. 
In their last meeting in Vienna, spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam. 
Both parties entente prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the policy of Islamization under way in Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change came mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union. 
Ban on travel abroad for Gary Glitter 
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star convicted of sexual abuse of children, traveling to France and Spain. 
The judges imposed a ban on Glitter six months after he informed the authorities of surveillance that I wanted to travel to Spain via France. 
Police in Kent made the ban on foreign travel last Thursday after which the judges had produced evidence of previous convictions for Glitter on child sex abuse. 
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing in the Magistrates Court from Ashford in Kent, but was represented by counsel, Corker Binning. 
A spokesman for the Courts Service said: "On Thursday, Sept. 25 at the Court of Magistrates from Ashford in Kent, police sought an order to block the travel of Mr Paul Gadd abroad as France and Spain until 25 March. 
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person." 
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the registration of sex offenders. 
He has to inform the authorities if you want to travel abroad for more than three days 
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date seven days before their departure. 
Police in Kent said he did not discuss the case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter place in the county. 
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "The Kent police would do everything possible to protect children in this country or abroad. 
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "The Kent police would do everything possible to protect children in this country or abroad. 
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage any potential risks more effectively. 
"Protecting the people of Kent is the main concern of the police in Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of sex offenders registered in the county and to minimize any risks that might exist for the public." 
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years. 
Glitter was freed when he flew to Bangkok, where he caught a flight to London. 
However, he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London. 
The Thai authorities did not allow it to pass through passport control and then flew to Hong Kong. 
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and flew him back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he returned to Britain. 
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Magistrates Court in Uxbridge, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully implemented the warrant register as a sex offender. 
Glitter was jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse. 
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister is reassured and delighted to know that Glitter had been forbidden to travel to France and Spain. 
"I understand the teacher away from scene to extract its character" Günther Bauer_Fotógrafo 
Neither heels or ruffles or dresses premiere. 
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration on the interpretation for the relaxed look of the man or woman. 
On one side the artist. 
At another, the person. 
Inseparable except in the privacy in those moments outside of the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen glance or the expressiveness of hands, blithe because they are not going to leave a scene. 
The German Günther Bauer alternating in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some put on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists that side with lesser-known of these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas. 
Included in the programming of the Month of Photography Flamenca, the exhibition reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day, "says creator, who explains that" Flemish-people "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of performers on stage. 
These people portrayed in the street "artists are able to convey passion on stage, sadness, joy ... captivating the public. 
To capture the personality of these artists do not have to take pictures of the scene. 
They bring personality and character within. 
What I was interested in creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me with the camera capturing the personality of the great flamenco. " 
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas," Bauer began a long journey in 1997 for portraying the singers, guitarists and dancers with a camera on board. 
They are portraits that due to the selection of the camera and photography reminiscent of classic material. 
The application of different stylistic breaks with the traditional base of the image, giving modernity, an idea that reflects its understanding of Bauer's own flamenco: "A very traditional music with roots that evolves and surprises every day." 
It is not the action of dancing, singing or tap it, but the artist's personality, his character, who captivates with her art to the public. 
The search for a meeting with the essentials, with the magic that is visible in a form of feeling, of being and are being held and has continued this work is presented these days at The Fotómata gallery. 
Known flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of nearly seventy artists photographed. 
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, soon to be published in a book that collected the portraits displayed in the sample. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer took him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ( "SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love portraying people, know and be able to enter a moment in his life, is an instant long or short. 
I believe that within the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre. 
Or you're with people face, characters, sometimes not know, or you leave only a few minutes to take the picture.

The Hispanic American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books changed their lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said it "has effects "and" makes people more inconforme, "and therefore called on the writers' not give in to the frivolity" and "assume responsibility" her vocation.

'Blood of May', the epic bet on Garci 
Guided by the National episodes of Benito Perez Galdos, Jose Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in May Blood, which is the most ambitious movie in his filmography with nearly 15 million euro budget. 
In this way, the filmmaker has attempted to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that has always admired the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarria to the front of a broad cast of performers. 
Blood of May, with a length of more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid more than four hours. 
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have complied with this shooting "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned three years ago to shoot a commemorative ribbon for the second centenary Madrid's May 2, which is accepted as long as the story was based on the National episodes. 
The 15 million budget that has brought in its entirety the Community of Madrid for Garci constitute a "unique opportunity" for the decor and atmosphere in the dressing room right of the portrait "a recklessness that Spain was wrong to head for the fight, and that the struggle for independence led to village to huge delays with the reign of Ferdinand VII, "he noted. 
But the filmmaker regrets not having received funding from the Alatriste or Ghosts of Goya - more than double the Blood-May, so it has not been able to shoot some scenes are set in a script signed alongside Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has worked in almost all his career. 
Therefore, the director of Start, which has affected their normal way of working, the staging with the actors, which often try before you start shooting and who does casting for sound " humiliating "and that" part of the job of director resides in the theater and go to the movies to know what is happening in the industry in which it works. " 
Many of the interpreters who agrees with the Blood of May to repeat his camera, as is the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo. 
Candidate for an Oscar four times - of which he won a-Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, the very blood of May, seven tables of Bill France and finally selected, The sunflowers are blind, they do not represent a younger generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that should be made known," he assured. 
With this movie Garci does not expect prizes. 
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that only work for the prosperity, and now you want to make a film more," says Garci after more than 30 years of career. 
Isabel Bayón recovered sevillana essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia 
A dancer will also pay homage to a dancer from Seville. 
Carmen Valencia Tortola, father of Catalan (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and was three years old when he moved to London with his family. 
He was a dancer dance free dance and a specialist in Oriental. 
He had a fascinating life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
There was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the brace that prevented the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman that marked a revolution dance and aesthetics in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character and I found incredible." 
According to the dancer, "not trying to count their lives but collect their spirit. 
The titles of his dances I have suggested Flamenco. 
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" I suggested a guajira, or "dance of the snake" tangos. 
Her dancing was sexy and I have been told that my dancing is also within this aesthetic, "he says. 
The assembly has two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again at an Elizabeth in her shows, as it did in the "open door" and the teacher Matilde Coral, who has wanted to work with exceptionally who outside his pupil. 
"Matilde makes more of Tortola, the character of maturity. 
I am happy because it has accepted in my work and I feel very honored by it. " 
The assembly also has the musical composition and guitarists Paco Arriaga and Jesus Torres, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the flea and Moi de Morón, the percussion of The Bird, as well as the viola Rafa The Viola and the collaboration of an actor , Juanfran Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divas in its entirety, and to always walk in love with them." 
In the play is also in some ways the life of this woman that was developed in places as distant, particularly for the era, like India, United States, or Russia, as well as across Europe, as they habitually resident in London . 
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is these women who have enormous influence over a given time and now nobody knows much less value placed on his work," says Bayón. 
The show will start today at 20.30 hours in the theater Lope de Vega. 
The publication of "Diary of a newlywed poet" also closes the Triennial

America is no less like Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them. " 
The phrase is of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice" and gives the idea of the helplessness of the American cinema, and throughout America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone. 
Look at their cost him an Oscar. 
And that was withdrawn since 2007. 
And who knew that he was very ill. 
Even so has been a blow for all. 
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond any expression, and I now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence." 
No one was afraid of making fools of ourselves or exaggerate. 
A father had died of film and the motherland at a particularly dark, afraid to terrorists and markets, with self-esteem by the American soil, searching desperately for reasons dignity. 
When the time is so hard and under the men and a few good people who admire you are, no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
Embodied for nearly all of a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was formally enemy Richard Nixon and defender of lost causes and won, since the foundation to combat drugs created in honor of his firstborn died from overdoses until their brand of homemade food and organic. 
All of a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a food culture suicidal. 
The shock wave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationality or passports. 
The latest James Bond, Daniel Craig English, noted that he has not killed a man but an era. 
Another English, oscarizado director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career. 
The bad guy come from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to draw Newman to his biggest inspiration. 
"We had left the bar very high for everyone," noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who now dares to try to live as he lived Paul Newman: Keeping the high demand for probity and to have a private life seriously and away of the cameras. 
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle. 
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example. 
Divorced once but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, which was certainly true when you on opportunities to not be. 
"But what I'm going to eat hamburger out of the home, whether within my steak?" I used to joke himself. 
In the sky has the pride of his daughters on earth coincide with their fans, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the great roles he played, none was so proud of the husband as a devout, loving father, grandfather, caring and dedicated philanthropist," they say. 
The career of an imperfect Madrid Olympic 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to be held in Madrid a few Olympics and, after the failed 2012 may be 2016. 
But I wonder, are we prepared? 
If we follow the lead of the race yesterday, I say no! 
The perfect career to call it, and my opinion has been by far the worst race in my state. 
A height of nonsense, of course, if you take into account as an assessment and I consider it would be a very clear suspense. 
But going by parties and from the beginning. 
The nonsense began with the ridge of the collection, which makes you have to go soon. 
This does not seem wrong, but if you do go and give it everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race). 
Well, no. 
Here you only had to go pick up the dorsal (first nonsense, just go for it) and (after the relevant tail), surprise! Only had size 'S' for the T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL) 
In what world we live? 
Or is that by the crisis have decided to buy only small shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper? 
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared with the day of the race. 
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue to get is 15 minutes and, furthermore, is to stop the backpack. 
Lasted more than 35 minutes waiting, something incomprehensible to a career where he is expected to more than 11,000 people. 
So, as expected, began the race and we still had not left the bag, but once accomplished, the collection was worse. 
In addition, rain entertain waiting for more than 40 minutes, which joined the popular rebellion and attempted assault on the stand. 
I think that some 500 people tomorrow will surely pneumonia, and some like myself, do not even appear with the correct time in the ranking due to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, I checked out properly. 
Of course, if I ask for the perfect race, this does not come into my thoughts. 
So I think we will continue to dream of an Olympic city well prepared. 
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual) 
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT Microsoft showed a preview of a new system of image and recognition of human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence but without much intelligence capable of performing some basic tasks, like asking a taxi (or in the case Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the campus of the company) in response to what we heard in the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are there in the room, who they are - even what to wear to remember - and listen and understand the keywords in their talks. 
It also grouped according to these groups of conversation. 
In the video shows the receptionist detects a third person but that does not belong to that group is talking with her and that is not an employee of the company. 
He asks if it's there to visit someone and he said he will respond shortly. 
All without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But that, of course, is the future. 
Now the company has better things to concentrate, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has spoken well above a change in strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers come with the essential rather than loaded with basurilla business would go five times faster - man, Steve, and will be for less. 
All of a finding given that Microsoft Version after version has added features and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of direction is welcome. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing relevance, and also the software. 
Chrome when Google went to the net, was one of those who supported the theory that it was the first step for Google to compete with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be needed because the layer is essential for the Hardware and Software understand each other. 
Fulfills the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to her mother-in-law. 
It's true. 
Never go away but we have to think about the "death" of the operating system rather than as an absolute truth, but relative. 
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
People are increasingly less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser. 
The computer boots just to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spent more time browsing in the window environment. 
What are half of the applications that come into the system? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less to Vista. 
Less heavy, less crowded, less complex. 
A Microsoft is more interested in integrating their online services and that finally they are an alternative to Google. 
We desperately need, in effect, and bring a little example. 
The photo I took this post in one of rest rooms for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond, earlier this month. 
In the soda machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our Future." 
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search on the net. 
Last week, incidentally, also confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
Will not arrive in early 2009 but at the end, rather pulling to 2010. 
Microsoft surely will look into the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone, after all, it is becoming increasingly computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street is going to happen bill. 
Marcel Le FABULEUX 
Pablo Picasso carried on the French Riviera, wearing a Leonardo di Caprio in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' from Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the parish gay muscular. 
And if we get a stellar list appearances, we can go back to the image of that forzudo whisker pointed that lifting weights in a traveling circus.

The 'tank', which they call the Anglo speakers, but it FABULEUX Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all others. 
First, for his flamboyant name - although it is familiarly known as' Marcel '- that has to do with sport gets its name because, according to legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf. 
'The Marcel' highlights on the other for its excellent cotton, cut on his unisex, for his distinctive coat and the little Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the standard T-shirt bearing most emblematic as detailed in the neck. 
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focused on their tank tops. 
It also includes college sweatshirts, Boxers retro, from cashmere cardigans, cotton trousers, shirts sea, babies, mini shorts ... 
Garments designed for comfort underwear. 
Although it is a shame to leave them as underwear. 
They are too sweet.

Drivers must repeat blood alcohol by installing the 'alcolock' 
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for blood alcohol, need to install in his car boot a system that prevents the vehicle drunk, or if it is not blowing. 
The initiative was announced last June and now is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, which is a pilot project that will last for one year. 
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so this will also receive a course of rehabilitation road. 
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecution of road safety, involving the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Institute for Security Technology Automobile (FIT). 
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunken driving back to catch the car. 
The alcolock avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle which measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents start the car if the driver does not blow Before, or when it detects a concentration of alcohol is higher than allowed. 
Its cost is higher than the 1,000 euros and shall be borne by the sanctions. 
In this regard, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce by up to 65% infractions during the first year of implementation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviors before they result in criminal offenses. 
And to facilitate its implementation, and that legal reform can be done by ordinary, and yet the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires a reform in an organic law. 
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any way trade, though it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some vehicles and public service. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies voted on tomorrow an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install on school buses this system, as has been done in France.

Speaking asleep 
Some children speak in the evening. 
I am not referring to those who wake up very espabilados tell us something that happened the previous day, but speaking children are asleep. 
The first time that happens to the best you bear a scare, but in reality it does not matter. 
It is a benign alteration of sleep is called somniloquios. 
It is not uncommon, especially in children and adolescents. 
Sure most of you have talked about that night. 
This phenomenon can occur in very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever) or a more regular basis (every day, once a week, once in months ...), the next day the child does not remember anything. 
There is no single cause to be determined by its appearance. 
They often are related to other sleep disorders are often as nightmares, the night terrors, bedwetting (made pee asleep), or sleepwalking, but need not be so. 
As already mentioned above can also be associated with paintings of very high fever, in situations of stress or overdrive. 
Anyway is a phenomenon rarely studied. 
The intensity with which he appears is also highly variable. 
You might talk in a quiet tone of voice, words, a whisper or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches ...). 
In cases where the event is very intense should observe the child and consult with a specialist to see if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives output in this way. 
We have said it is a benign abnormality therefore has no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disturbance that it can be treated (for example, if is associated with sleep apnea or a box of stress). 
What it does do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Try not excite much to the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore games look calm and avoid programs or television series that are scary or a little violent. 
Children with very nervous and it costs them a lot relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm. 
This will enable the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
Once appear somniloquias try to stay calm. 
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day will not remember anything of what happened. 
Helpful Hints 
Not despertéis. 
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and he romperéis sleep. 
Even when speaking, he is sleeping and therefore is resting. 
Remember that if you are very anxious for several episodes should consult or to find out what it generates so much anxiety in children. 
If it means what it says (which is not the most common), caigáis not be tempted to make an interrogation to draw information. 
Not conseguiréis anything, because being asleep is not aware as to organize his thoughts. 
In addition oiréis what you say, but do not know what it is dreaming to say that, so very careful in how interpretáis information and the conclusions that sacáis. 
You never say to the child who can cross it at night to learn their secrets. 
Not even in jest. 
That generates a lot of anxiety. 
In short, do not worry, it is not anything wrong, is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.

The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity. 
Without having made a good game, the team created many chances to score and was able to make a goal to win the match. 
The pace was not very steady during the meeting in which the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.

But Dannemarie not seize the occasion and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens that fell a bit to "compress" his defense, except in the final seconds of play during which, after a major sputter, the ball went close to the field cross. 
Sarkozy is to fishermen furious 
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a detour by Britain.

They promised to receive it "with a constructive spirit" and hoped that "come up with concrete proposals." 
The presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to get measures against the rising prices of diesel, marking a record high to reach 1.14 euros per liter. 
According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss them with solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to return to be competitive and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of the sailors."

In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday in the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national committee responsible for fisheries, which held its movement. 
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen did not leave" and "do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou for example, the chairman of the fisheries of Lorient. 
Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently paid about 50 cents per liter but consider that they can reach the point of financial equilibrium of a boat with only a diesel with a lower price to 0.30 euro per liter.

Obama, winner in the first televised duel 
At the first debate between the two candidates on Friday at the White House succeeded another to see who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama. 
No surprise, the campaign headquarters of Republican and Democrat proclaimed its own victory in the televised duel that has been followed by one third of American families. 
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the benefit of John McCain, though honorable, was not "quite" brilliant "to enable it to curb its low in the polls five weeks of the presidential election. 
The Gallup institute, whose public opinion poll released last Sabato gives five points of advantage for Obama (49% vs. 44% for McCain), it is judged that the Democrat who went well. 
Among the undecided voters who are counted, Obama came out victorious with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the sound of their expected delivery member in his own candidacy, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate. 
He has good instincts, "cautioned however Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenarian McCain showed his undisputed expertise in foreign policy, stressing the "naivete" of his opponent on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ..." he accused on several occasions. 
"I do not think that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to become president," also said. 
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements. 
Obama stressed that it represented the future. 
Without disconcerting, was concise and precise. 
Enhanced its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, it has already done," retorted, this weekend, a television advertising Democrat to Republican who reproached him for not having seen the important impact of the crisis on the Americans. " 
"Over ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing on you, Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20 000 people who had gathered for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under a hail reece. 
No pronounced the words "middle class" or "workers". "The defeat financial clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans as the person most capable of saving the economy is on the brink of the precipice. 
"Next week could be a decisive episode," felt yesterday, the influential Democrat, and Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former wicker of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
According to the Democratic candidate, the disaster fund Current "is the final result of eight years of bad economic policy put into execution by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that came despite everything to reduce taxes 95% of Americans despite the shocks from Wall Street, the Illinois senator also noted that the eventual realization of a country's energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was their first priority, with the creation of a safety and health.

"In Minsk," Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? " 
Youth and opposition demonstrators last Sunday in the evening in the main square in the Belarussian capital, to reject in advance the outcome of legislation. 
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the close of polling centers in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation. 
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko, "the dictator, has to resign." 
Some acknowledge they voted no, "why, as it will do what they want with my vote," said a young man. 
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to carry out democratic change. 
The sanctions, among which l'interdiction of visas for 40 Belarussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets could be lifted if these elections are regarded as clean for observers. 
They were not as the opposition. 
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Iouri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve games. 
"It's a cosmetic change, he stressed Milinkievitch Alexandre, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the movement towards Europe, because what matters is who has the votes, and in our house, is the executive branch. 
If some opposition MPs entering parliament, because it is will have been appointed but not elected. 
"But their entry into parliament could mean television appearances, meetings and proposals in the areas of law." 
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because "we have to start dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which has many faces debts of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the election process does not recognize the validity of the vote. 
Underlines that the figures of participation seem too high, and that the widespread vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) favored manipulations. 
"Have you noticed the elections? Questions the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two political prisoners released in August this year. 
There was nobody in the polls. 
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs to parliament, which agreed better to power. " 
The silence of the night back again in October Square. 
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission was congratulated for its success. 
The interview - Blood returns to be safe 
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated its 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most efficient providers of blood in the world. 
And above all, reconquered the confidence of the public who had been seriously faltered for the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As is known, the reserves managed by national blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s. 
Faced with this tragedy and to the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada made in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, who sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to this tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster is not play more. 
While the judge Krever took to submit their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that was aimed at planning a new system of management of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau fulfilled this mission. 
As a result of reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood supply to all other provinces and two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary. 
The situation was grim. 
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public, "he says before assert proudly that at the beginning of 2008, approximately 94% of the population Quebec hereinafter had confidence in Héma-Québec. 
Dr. Décary reminded however that "confidence is extremely fragile." 
Since its inception, the Sept. 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, in Europe attended the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has Décary. 
And we did not know if this disease could be transmitted through blood. 
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which we do not know where and when a serious illness may stem from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by degeneration of brain that leads inevitably to death, established measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, for refusing the blood of people who had been over a month in the UK since 1980. 
But a few years ago, has been proved beyond all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied was the end. " 
In 1999 appeared on the market much more sensitive technique for detecting HIV tests that detect nuclide acid in the blood directly from donors the presence of the virus and not antibodies against the virus, which grounded the tests used until now. 
The evidence of acid nuclide helped shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time that the first virus can be detected in blood by our techniques, says the specialist. 
We were able to reduce this period lasting less than a week. 
Thus reducing substantially the risk that some donors may be infected without knowing it and that we can not detectable. 
These improvements helped significantly lower the risk of contracting HIV by a blood transfusion. 
Today, one person every 12 million are at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
"That means it will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
So since Héma-Quebec distributing each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, will spend more than 24 years before that there occurs a case of transmission of HIV through a blood product. 
I think you can now receive or require a blood transfusion to recover without health concerns, "said the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
I never know which pathogen could emerge in the system. 
Last year appeared on the island of Reunion that the Chikungunya virus, following the example of West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
You have to be constantly vigilant, "pursued Dr. Décary before emphasize that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide adequate supplies. 
"The needs are increasing as the population ages. 
As the most aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need an infusion of red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors covering an average of only 3% of Quebeckers are eligible for blood donation. " 
All people with good health, 18 years and that relate to the eligibility criteria can nevertheless give blood every 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where there is malaria, will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With this 3%, we succeeded in maintaining an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals. 
The hardships are very rare. 
But we have to renew to the members of this network of donors as they age and can only donate their blood. 
But it is hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all, retain and encourage them to become regular donors. 
Because life today is very rampant, rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate their blood, "Francine Décary was distressed. 
With a budget of 297 million dollars a year, Héma-Québec caters not only blood products, but also human tissues, including the bone grafts, heart valves, skin and eyeballs that is almost exclusively used for major burns. 
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also operates the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was regarded as biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood stem cells that can be used for treatment of serious diseases like leukemia. 
"We have had a few weeks ago, putting on the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and is expected to draw over a thousand of these a year. 
We should begin to propose to graft at the beginning of next year, "explains Dr. Décary describing this program takes cord blood as very popular. 
"Many mothers are disappointed in not being able to enjoy this," since Héma-Québec does not have resources to offer this program complex and expensive in all the hospitals in Quebec. 
Softball - The Impact in the semifinals 
The Montreal Impact is qualified for the semi-finals of the knockout rounds of the USL's first division, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in short end) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the series of quarter-final at the Stade Saputo.

The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today. 
In brief - The victorious goal of Kovalev 
The trio of Canadian number one is willing to embark on the season. 
The unit consists of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack on a gain by the Canadian 3-2 free throws to the barrier in front of the Florida Panthers, last night at the Bell Center. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, marked a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aid, and Kovalev picked a pass on this gain, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches. 
Kovalev gave the victory marked the only goal. 
"I'm not ready, warned Russian. 
"I need another game to feel comfortable." 
He tried to play to the maximum in the first half, scored Guido Carbonneau. 
But I think we appreciated the end of the match. 
It had a nice ovation. " 
Charest addresses North 
The prime minister does not rule out launching elections by end of year 
As soon as the end of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to choose during the election today. 
Rejecting the limits of our last great frontier in the north ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the broad, general counsel at the end of the Quebec Liberal Party, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, were projected images. 
Parades, on three huge screens, images of spectacular hydroelectric dams, mining operations, seen in Quebec for "Google Maps", maps, etc.. 
Major media during the election period. 
The prime minister thinks that elections will take place this fall, but noted that his schedule was too crowded. 
The Plano North "is the fourth side of a" vision "that the prime minister intends to take Quebec, that of a" new economic space ", which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to 49 ° parallel - he had never been the subject of a presentation. 
The prime minister was limited, however, explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential," but did not give a term, investment amounts, nor accurate priority in future projects. 
This could especially be developed are particularly hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North has "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and diamond," according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This "land twice as large as France," "is our home, is in Quebec. 
Not only is our home, but that is in us, "he insisted, as it sought to show a national founding myth. 
Quebec was built to thank you very much its relationship with the North, stressed: the flood toward the gold in Abitibi, engineering Quebec, James Bay. 
"We belong, is our future," he added, after having made a dramatic pause to contemplate the immense map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Quebec Labrador who always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference. 
"There is a traditional position that all governments reiterated. 
There is a borderline at which they will not agree a long time and when the opportunity presents, I reiterate that position from the government, "he said. 
In addition, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said speaking of the northwest passage, which opens each year due to melting of ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit? 
The prime minister said the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young. 
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the party's Quebec Ungava), and began consultations about thirty communities. 
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work. 
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a meeting in which "there will be a common vision." 
The development of the North would be made in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North Plan "will be concluded, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with the prime ministers of the liberals who preceded him. 
"As the liberals who preceded us, we thought of another way to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was one of the recurring themes weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail party to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to power of the party. 
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout. 
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec in Lesage that made the quiet revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, Bourassa did in the James Bay our party did shape the future," said John Charest. 
At the press conference, invoked another reference, this conservative, the "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 until 1963. 
Touching on the topic of the proposed hydroelectric dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, sir. Charest stressed that its entry into service is scheduled for 2012. 
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," confided to his militants, raising applause. 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, what the law allows. 
Stresses that his schedule is full, however, particularly because of a mission of the council of the federation in China and a summit Quebec-New York. 
The general council weekend supplied to the head a liberal platform containing resolutions nationalists, particularly "constitutional aspirations" who had no trouble being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec claiming in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" on Constitution. 
Quebec would also like to name members of the Council of broadcasting and telecommunications Canadian and they have a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec. 
Sided with the opposition, we welcomed the broad outlines of the plan with skepticism North. 
The leader of the Parti Quebecois, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy of Northern Quebec that the government had launched Landry in 2001. 
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned implement it. 
Had it done so, "we would progress today," said Ms. Marois next to their candidate in Jean-Talon (voting that took place today), Françoise Mercure. 
The Democratic Action of Quebec appeared to support the adoption of a Plan of Northern part of the government. 
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said the leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today. 
Lyrics - A country dishonored 
Is Mr. Vic Toews, a former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) In the Harper cabinet, which was allowed last summer to say that Louise Arbor was a "disgrace" to Canada. 
Dishonor and this woman who led a relentless fighter for justice and it deserves our full admiration for what it says everything about the relations of the prime minister and Stephen Harper. 
We are in front of a government that is the only one among all the western countries involved, it has not repatriated to their national who is locked in a concentration camp in Guantanamo. 
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts which are recriminados occurred. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneging on its promise and let live in inhumane conditions a child-soldier. 
The only thing chonta with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers, particularly, argue the repatriation of Omar Khadr for the purpose of enjoying the benefit of a fair hearing in Canada. 
That this government is closing its eyes on torture: it matters little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of abuses. 
Yet we realize that, but right now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat, and that makes no sense. 
It is now time in which there is no more moral: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrary jailing a Canadian citizen wants as the head of a minority government until now (what will happen after the Oct. 14?). 
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a match that commends Virtue, Law and Order: do not see that this government resigned to what he was doing the reputation and dignity of our country. 
Sr. Toews is the embarrassment caused by this withdrawal and nothing else. 
Free opinion - the Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Following Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold says that the largest gold company in the world tried a trial for defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate." 
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is true that the judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law. 
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely overshadowed by Mr. Garver. 
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public discussion would harm whoever dares to hold a position contrary to theirs? 
The outcome of the litigation has little significance, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare his defense and combat, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers maintained by the nearly bottomless pockets of the mining. 
The tactic in these struggles uneven, it often is to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement to muzzle the opposition in addition to frighten anyone will dare to revisit the issue. 
If Barrick Gold truly had wanted a public debate, is ahead of public opinion that would have had to present his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where it works Barrick Gold, the discussions in Canada normally be made by the exchange of ideas and not coups stick. 
Suffice it to the mine opened their books, their files and set up a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent teams of search that could have shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold appears not to rely on public opinion and rejected the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada. 
¿Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how you can ask for a debate "public" ignoring the views of this? 
According to the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept. 
In a democracy, the detractors also have the right to speak. 
What we do not understand - or do not want to understand - Barrick Gold, which is holding the public to authors and publishers of Noir Canada makes it especially because it rejects the brutal manner of mining. 
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and try him, but on the basis of civilized changes of arguments, and not as part of what many people perceive as a persecution-gag (to pursue the "public debate", Barrick Gold has a deposit injunction with respect to the authors of Noir Canada notified to not use that word more). 
In addition to the speech by Mr surreal. Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom and search for truth, key pair all democratic societies. 
Denied the right to cite credible sources and make a discussion on the facts and interpretations, which represent the base of knowledge workers. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects who dislike the undertakings of this world rich in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who can do it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate and transparent, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
You have a right of reply. 
Academia, to which we belong, has long been known to manage the discussions and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what is claimed, has no desire to make a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to place devices to limit this kind of unfair persecution. 
Operation to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the economic rescue plan more important since the Great Depression of the 30s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion U.S. dollars which aims to stem the financial crisis that shook Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress. 
Particularly provides a better control by the elected they are put in place, new mechanisms that are intended to ensure the repayment of public money invested in the new rules to curb the number of houses seized the lack of payment as well as a right control over the wages paid to the leaders of business relief. 
The U.S. Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon negotiating che lasted two days. 
"We made great progress towards an agreement that is effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to put the economy under cover and ordinary Americans before the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: if we do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbance on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations were finished very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect it would create a new failure in the mood of investors. 
The last hour they had set was the opening of markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential elections that have acceded to the negotiations later, they were more favorable to the agreement, without however forgetting express their dissatisfaction of being compelled to reach this end. 
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama gave him some provisions for reaching agreement, particularly that would allow owners to retain their home and on the wages of the surviving leaders of enterprises by the state. 
"When asked to taxpayers take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not welcome. 
But these measures are necessary, "he said on American television. 
His Republican opponent, John McCain, another string Questioned on whether to vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details but hope to vote on it." 
"The important points that I read [show] is something we will have to digest and with which we can move forward. 
He said that the option of doing nothing is unacceptable. " 
The plan aims to buy 700 billion in taxpayers' money doubtful debts, assets to risks and unmarketable American financial institutions. 
Comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage credit risk before spreading to other most common forms of debt obligations (PCAA) and cause a freezing of liquidity and an exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
Is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week. 
We believe that we have left the stalemate since the Democrats have accepted that certain assets "toxic" to companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
With the goal of smoothing the rough for everybody in Congress, also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could seek to impose new fees to help recover money. 
The new plan provides for payment of a first part of 250 billion to 100 which may be added another billion if the president deems it necessary. 
The payment of 350 thousand million would have to be confirmed by another vote of the Congress. 
In exchange for their help, Washington will get shares in companies that relief will be worth dividends if profits and may re-sell when the storm will pass. 
The federal government has the option of delaying the arrest procedures that concerned with the housing obtained loans under this plan and to set limits on remuneration and compensation paid in cash upon the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, still is not sure that his plan will be approved. 
Some people continued yesterday to protest against this project, both from Republicans and Democrats. 
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the finance committee of the chamber, told his constituents that "all evidence, Washington does not want to understand." 
"We have a very serious financial problem. 
There are some solutions. 
But that is not taking advantage of taxpayers. " 
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is moderator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but reaches the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: we ask the Congress not to rush and to consider carefully the route we should take," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, had once again proof of the global nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas known who resigned to buy its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars ) During the crisis of housing loans at risk in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and insurers of the ten largest. 
"This is not money lost, said yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos. 
Instead, we recover the right to vote at the bank and influence. 
It's just something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain. " 
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and the bank accounts of British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, the British government would nationalize the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon compromised 
Her blue eyes were for so long his triumph. 
Does the American actor with a charming smile had been released from his narcissistic side? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident also be removed from the register of the real power they have sacred monsters. 
But what great runner background! 
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at 83 years, because of a lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years splendor. 
It is less phenomenal that Brando, who appeared much and that was for long regarded as a rival in the film, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions. 
The mixed bloods are often children magnificent. 
Born in Ohio in 1925, the German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots born of a glorious side of the American dream. 
Without exaggerated ego, the latest mark of quality. 
Because it was designed around a country enamored of the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, that at the beginning of the 50s he studied drama at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before to succeed in the theater, on television and in cinemas soon. 
The man who campaigned for civil rights was also the pilot car, which was ranked in second place in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, folded with a sex symbol, although a member of a couple models made since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward . 
He also disappear with the sides of this star secrets secret, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of show business that we do not know very well. 
It is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman caused the dizziness to filmgoers this weekend, while a large entrechoquen their roles in the black screen of memories. 
More than half a century of cinema in American life moving procession through it. 
Many memories come back to memory as the cow-boy with a charming Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sexy wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the roof of zinc adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958 . 
Closer to home (1990), refer to your sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled by a marriage that did not meet all their promises. 
Others like Paul Newman have gone into film history. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hate), Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956. 
This mangante sympathetic in the sumptuous film "The Sting (The Coup), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Billiard player and avenger bitter in the magnificent movie The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), repeated the character in The Color of Money for Martin Scorsese, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 from nine nominations. 
This changing face over the years, it was him. 
Still there. 
The times changed during his career. 
Young people know him mainly through Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of ice hockey unorthodox. 
His fans see him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coen brothers. 
With a last role of godfather of the mafia in Irish Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was twisting. 
Contrary to several legends of cinema who left quite early career, Newman was much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendor and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge living in the" underplaying "and that their performance judged too supported. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman that the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything. 
But less often performed the role of gallant young man of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastards or desperate, whose features reflect the rebellions. 
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed his true sensitivity pudica sides not very known. 
His film Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (depending on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy. 
He who lost her son Scott as a result of an overdose he dedicated his film, Harry and Son in 1984, the work of modesty and sadness. 
"Among the many tributes that were triggered yesterday for Newman, his close friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened," my life and my country were better thanks to its existence " 
Generosity, love for survival are traits of the actor died. 
On the other side of his legendary career, also hides a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent film, an anti against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We will have seen his face a long reign on the boats vinaigrette sauce of sauces, from biscuits and other food, tried this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag. 
The profits from these sales were given to his foundation for children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than content of his myth, should be committed to the end. 
They left their five daughters a letter containing these words: "provided to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his lucky star. 
It was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous. 
In short a model citizen. 
What they produced at the factory invoice Zuschlag &amp; Co. ? 
Soon, the Oct. 8, will start criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and their accomplices. 
Accusing the politician and his accomplices to commit fraud of significant harm, so business, and continuously in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, among them the falsification of documents. 
The Prosecutor General's Office used for his own purposes funds raised in public tenders often justifying the tasks with false invoices. 
Public funds and of the municipalities - as a whole some 65 million HUF - stopped in part on the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pockets of individuals. 
The method, which was released by investigators as well, was to justify the collection of funds raised in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual implementation, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations. 
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false. 
To do so had the books on the market and the District of Józsefváros circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question of who in the name of which company should make the counterfeit bill was decided to include in that trip to the Region's Higher Balaton where János Zuschlag sent István Sides. 
The latter confessed that for this purpose should choose hostels and restaurants. 
He called his bill for consumption and these served as a model for making the bills presented in competitions including the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as in the municipality of the capital. 
These bills were signed in the main by István Sides and his accomplice András Ori, who according to our information rather write reports in order to obtain public subsidies. 
During one of his "study tours" Sides chose a brewery. 
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, the center provided the gourmet meal for a group of ninety of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However - according to the manager of the center - many people do not fit at the same time there. 
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Foundation Jobb Jövőért - later called to együttes Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors. 
Then a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there overnight, however in the bill reflected cent and thirty people. 
But manufacturers of high fantasy bill also exaggerated when told the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the keeping of the same - according to information given to the Prosecutor's Office - had no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hopper. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told him to hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and showed him the bills, I knew it was false documents. 
"In the stamp on behalf of our company and the NIF appeared in wrong place." 
He added: In addition to the problems formal nor as concurred that the bill stayed hundred people, since they have only eleven rooms in which many people do not fit. 
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant for some time that does not work. 
The enthusiastic manufacturers invoices were not reported either that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organized exclusively trips abroad, so that the invoice for payment in cash foolishly indicated as a travel service within Hungary, which also coincided with the practice of issuing bills for the agency. 
Moreover, as was learned during the investigation included in the document-VAT as well, although they travel outside the European Union were exempt from taxes. 
Among other things, the extent of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. Jobb Jövőért for the foundation, since the services of the company are not loaded with a 25 but with only 15 per cent VAT, plus employees of the hotel bills extending only machine-made, however, the bill was manual. 
Besides the "shippers" also committed other errors, as in the case of a company in which he questioned the bill as an activity carried on the road to which - was revealed during investigations by the prosecution - founded the company does not perform as a consultant investment. 
Likewise for formal differences - improper format of the bill, fake-stamp it became known that false invoices were issued for együttes to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont. 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Camp Kunfehértó Deportivo, whose representatives denied having issued such bills. 
Counterfeiters also paid attention to that when the group Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document. 
Issued consciously bills 
Another group of manufacturers of fake bills are made up of those who were aware of bogus invoices to be issued. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták issued bills worth around four million HUF in the name of the Foundation együttes to Harmadik Évezredért. 
The manager of collab Kft. - According to the indictment - convinced him one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing bogus invoices. 
Similarly Zuschlag working with their accomplices and the BioGate Kft., Currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices with a value of around five million HUF to the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlasz Egyesület and partnership Vörösfenyő Egyesület without real economic activity behind. 
There was no movement of capital either, because then canceled the invoices prepared but forgot to put in their papers to this entity. 
In the next group of manufacturers of fake bills include those that have some connection with the defendants. 
For example demandadero Ivan Kubatov was the Ukrainian's manager of the Delta Trio SL based on fictitious Budapest, which dealt with trade in fuels and vehicles. 
The company issued numerous invoices with a value of approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer equipment. 
According to data from research these bills were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since the September 14, 2005 is under liquidation. 
The manager of this company was a Romanian who Kubatov Ivan should have also released documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005. 
We have information that Kubatov admitted during investigation that issued in the name of the company's invoices for Atlasz, for the Hopper and együtt for a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. Romanians were founded by masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov. 
However, none of the companies functioned effectively because - as the accused - who did not get to work. 
But took advantage of these companies, because at the request of his lawyer Zsolt Szent accomplice, who prepared the documents for registration of the company, issued invoices on behalf of corporations for organizations linked with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for the Y -Generation. 
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 bills to various entities at a value of 14.2 billion HUF. 
The Prosecution considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices. 
That man took advantage of even the limited partnership SZI-Beri for issuing bogus bills used in the contest Biztos Pont. 
The Y-generation and Szövetség Modern Magyarországért submitted to a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility of the Socialist Party. 
Won the contest HUF 500 thousand, respectively, but did not use the money to the goals of the contest. 
To discover that this was not presented to the TMA five invoices received from the fictitious Works Team Kft. 
These bills were found during the search of the office that had Kemecsei Árpád at the Ministry of Education. 
Part of the defendants probably recounted at the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - during the falsification of invoices. 
The most interesting may be the main confession of the accused himself János Zuschlag, if you decide to dismantle everything. 
Because their confessions have not been very detailed and although repeatedly promised to talk about everything, it has not done so thus far. 
The question is: what interest has to do it?, As perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists reached an agreement with him to Zusi assume all responsibilities. 
Who, moreover, up to these days could umbrage, as to relieve their prison conditions sought house arrest, but was denied repeatedly. 
While many perpetrators of crimes much higher economic value, which never returned the money, walk freely or at least they can expect in their own homes sentence, he has no possibility for that. 
Psychology of overlap: Why spend more money? 
The participants of the auctions are likely to spend more money and overestimate the product. 
Neuroscientists and economists from the University of New York discovered the neurological basis - this economic well-known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as auctions on eBay, why even prefer to pay a price too high. 
The scientists attempted to outline the neurological impact of this "game" by means of experimental auctions. 
One group of volunteers playing lottery, the other was involved in an auction and meanwhile discussed by the system of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) active areas of the brain of people involved in the experiment. 
In both games the participants could make money, but at the auction, which is a key element to bet more than the other, to lose the game became more intense operation of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex. 
This area of the brain, plus many other roles, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto prize" of the nervous system. 
So according to scientists, raising the stakes are explained as a prevention so as not to cause an intense reaction of the stratum. 
To substantiate his theory, economists scientific group also conducted a study of financial monitoring. 
In this experiment, three groups bet on a person under different circumstances. 
The control group were simply told the real value of the product in question and its members bet. 
On top of that another group was promised that if they win, would receive more than 15 U.S. dollars prize. 
In contrast, the third group received just 15 U.S. dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group lost even that money. 
So the only difference between the two groups was that a victory was highlighted and the other for the failure. 
However, proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to bet even more that members of the control group and the group "winner". 
"These results can not be deducted from any previously existing economic theory. 
Because those so far explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the joy of winning and to the prevention of risks. 
Only neurological visual methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so now we come to a third explanation "- established Andrew Schott, a professor at the faculty of economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When should I go to the doctor? 
In the world some five million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary the chronic disease of the liver is considered one of the leading causes of death. 
An estimated one hundred thousand the number of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receiving treatment since many patients do not know they are infected. 
The designation of hepatitis is the common name for different Liver disease caused by viruses. 
The symptoms are very similar, are characteristic infection of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases are quite distinct. 
The virus of hepatitis depending on the pathogen spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (for example with infected water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses in the blood and moods Corporal (semen, humor of the vagina, saliva). 
It is recommended for travelers to protect vaccine virus A and B, against C vaccines do not exist. 
Symptoms of hepatitis A by two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, is manifested through a generally poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea. 
After that appear on the skin and the whites of the eyes jaundice, the stool becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks. 
Annually one million people died worldwide in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease. 
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected receive drug treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most of those infected do not know who is sick because this pathological agent in gradually destroys cells in the liver and often the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years. 
Therefore it is very important to the premature recognition, the medical routine. 
It is much more common disease in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those with tattoos. 
There are currently some 200 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic hepatitis C. 
As this disease can be discovered by a routine control laboratory is also worth consulting with the doctor of the family to experience any symptoms unknown. 
The disease is cured if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus in the body and can suppress the infection and prevent cancer. 
On September 30 is World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of its premature recognition. 
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God? 
Depending on the outcome of a recent investigation, religious faith has also alleviated calming effect that the death of the martyrs of Catholicism. 
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: analyzed that the religious belief in what way affects the human pain - reported by the British newspaper Telegraph. 
As part of this unique experiment applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the faithful Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was able to verify that the faithful Catholics were able to activate that part of your brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in which the side of the academics are also involved scientists, philosophers and theologians of the various departments of the University. 
The analysis was as follows; set a scintillating to the left hand of the patient, who applied the electric shock. 
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment that set its sights on two paintings, the Virgin Mary, sculpted by Sassoferrato 17th century and the Lady of the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci's 15th century. 
Investigators had hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a true religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose the painting by Leonardo because he was not too different from the other, and thought that was calming effect. 
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while watching the painting of religious theme or the other. 
Catholics said that in looking to the Virgin Mary were on "security" as "protected", "should be reassuring and reigned in his heart peace." 
Looking at the picture of religious theme felt about 12 percent less pain when watching the works of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, think that with any image can be so powerful an effect similar to atheists as well, you just have to find the appropriate image. 
"We should find a portrait of a person by that feel very positively, like for a mother or a father" - said the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the outcome of the investigation. 
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes your personality" - added Wright. 
After these results is a formidable one question: What effect would be for the regulation of pain if it will show faithful to the Madonna by Leonardo or other painter of his size? 
Does the vision of a Virgin Mary of high quality yield even better results? 
You are what you say to yourself 
In his tenth birthday on Google can say: you can find both in the pocket of people, as in the sky over his head; knows where they spent their holidays, what doctors visit and what they are interested. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough. 
On the other hand skeptics who make a parallel with the vision orweliana not see the essence of Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times newspaper that the main aim of Google is gathering the largest possible amount of personal data about their users, and this is necessary in order to fulfill the original goals of the founders of Google: "meet in a system All information in the world. " 
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to treat all information. 
When asked to what will happen in five years and Schmidt replied: I wish that Google would reply to questions like "What do you do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job that I should?" - However, the software can not reply to questions as seemingly simple as insufficient information from users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Web are stored accurately searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages where he spent at the end of the search. 
Thanks for such a Personalized Search which debuted two years ago, users can store their own history of navigation, they can go back to see what they were looking earlier, which opened this record and thanks to generate much more customized searches on this same logic Recommendations based on, in which the system will provide us with products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored. 
What happens if my data advantage against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - Ask users who care about seeing the information monopoly of Google. 
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company it can not be fearful and remorse, fear of punishment, the yearning for freedom or rebellion against the power. 
But it is a fact already confirmed that not only preserved but also in justifiable cases transferred to third wanted all the expressions in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users. 
The most debated in recent times was perhaps coordinated action against pedophiles Brazilians, when Google gave the Brazilian government reports of its Web page, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles. 
Instead, Internet users who care about the rights of individuals, in May eased when the company along with the EFF, an organization for defending the electronic rights, demonstrated successfully in court that he was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, it can not compel Google, through any of the points of the constitution to provide any information requested in secret by the FBI. 
(At the same time managed to get the federal government under the pretext of strengthening the law on Protection of Children adopted years ago, nearly fifty thousand Web addresses and a few thousand phrases searched, but without obtaining the lists of search for individual users, nor Neither the full lists of websites and keywords from the last two months.) 
This is quite contradictory opinion on Google: those critics who fear providing their personal data because they think that hurts your privacy, your private life to begin using Google's services, and rebel against it as against multinational companies for conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and their enthusiastic supporters, and Internet users in other countries, they are the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", but not to its rival, Microsoft, Windows and cataloged by his conqueror of the World , Even though both striving for the same purpose. 
This can happen because Google's unlike Microsoft, does not ask for any user identification code, no money for their applications, the code is open and free software package, constantly updated and appears more youthful, more collaborator who practice the officer of the software giant. 
But it can also be seen as a geek with precision the very problematic relationship between the rights of individuals and the Internet that there was just one of the key words most frequently mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0. 
Web 2.0 is collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and take advantage of the communication channels available, and while the actions of these individuals vary, the essence remains the same: to show us ourselves. 
A young man can have normal profile pages on numerous collective, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm which offers custom list of your music, then these can include in the a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, which automatically appear the most recent photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or in Picasa. 
We know of many cases which show that the bride for example, to see the flow of photographs from the morning of friends, learns with whom spent the night before her boyfriend fraudulent or may dismiss the employee of a company because This writes his candid opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is for sure, the definition of privacy is fully appreciated. 
Life "on line" of a person is what it shows itself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of today. 
And you want to hide something, or at least intended to bypass the monopoly of Google, you can do (for example starting with the Scroogle system that uses the Google search, but leaves no traces). 
There are many people who do not want to sign up on the pages to prevent the group may encounter, but you can replace the applications online for Google, since the drafting of software applications to image and newsreader with alternative versions which is not connected with giant servers or prepare the perfect profile as possible on us. 
The public expects that almost openly in the day that Google shows its true face. 
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), surfaces Advertising AdWords / AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies, while the services are introduced rapidly causing increasingly severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also to numerous other companies for software developers. 
Observers critics, however, will find alarming contradictions as well: for example senior management flatly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of child care for the company, considered too expensive unlimited number of feeding employees, but All this is nothing compared with that in the year 2006, Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company under the agreement leaked any information that violates good morals and interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the internal regulations of the company said it was not announced any new service in advance, but only when it was ready to go, what is certain is that if the problems anticipated in the coming months and years may stir the world: while some believe that the proposed scanning and archiving of books and magazines such dimensions that Google will acquire the company soon will be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear for their health system, because it can create our own health profile complete with analysis above with our doctors and our problems. 
And the fact that Google will create a genetic database, can provide a good raw material for writers of works of science fiction, Scroogled, the popular novel of Cory Doctorow, in describing orweliana one future way in which Only a man of the data from Google can be described alarmingly well. 
Two children helped to erase all traces the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd. 
The police questioned two minors on the double murder of Ózd who, according founded suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Commissioner-General of Public Order of the province of Borsod. 
The girls admitted the crime to them was charged, and now are accused of fautores the crime. 
The two children - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - may defend themselves in freedom. 
For the complicity can receive up to 5 years in prison. 
The defendant's double murder of Ózd - a man of 23 years - is in custody since Sunday. 
The crime he is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed. 
During investigations it was revealed that the youngest 23 years he was a large sum to a man aged 53. 
The defendant did not want to pay their debt, why on Wednesday of last week summoned its creditor to the headquarters of a company Ózd, where they killed him and then also killed a 9-year-old daughter of the victim. 
According to information of the ITNs, the couple was prepared long before to perpetrate the crime because he committed the murder with a gun hidden previously at the crime scene. 
The police analyzed with an expert to the weapon and the circumstances of its use. 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - by one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state. 
99 per cent of the shares are held by the Polish State that within a few months to sell 60 percent of them. 
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the supply of Poles has been the highest among those offered by those concerned by the Prague Stock Exchange. 
According to the Czech press, so far gave the bid the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse. 
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that among those concerned the new owner would be the worst stock market in Warsaw and did not rule out the possibility that this in a future disappear Stock Exchange Prague. 
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange by about 5 to 10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement of the shareholders could sell about 90 percent of the shares. 
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of 25 per cent, followed by Bank with 14.7 Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 per cent. 
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European press 
The main European newspapers in their reviews of Tuesday engaged in the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second Sept. 11." 
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president - believes the Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to enlist the support of his own party to the bill made in haste, which aims to give solution to this desperate situation. .. 
Instead of a new "HABORO Pearl," which spoke of the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett, is more correct to speak of a "second Sept. 11." 
According to a portion of the press in Madrid, Washington is the scapegoat. 
According to El Mundo the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led to the global economy on the brink of the abyss. 
Growing danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system and this certainly will affect the whole world. 
While Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote raises the danger that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when it is carried out one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism. 
You can not ignore this threat - says the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva. 
Some states today can still throw a lifesaver belt shaky financial institutions, and may well save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money. 
But if you like the domino was yet crumble over the bank, then it will no longer suffice, nor the new funds, nor the new improvisations. 
It takes a long time that the member states of the European Union put aside their selfishness nationalist and centralize control over the fragmented financial markets. 
Financial institutions received in crisis on Monday, just over 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that increasingly are real concerns, as did the Americans, also European taxpayers have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis. 
The EU so far has not dealt seriously with the crisis passes as a cúname for the Old Continent. 
The "saviors" will not have to immediately submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if defined: in what cases is justified to use taxpayers' money to prevent a greater evil? 
The Smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee 
What would be the best method to develop technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of sensors obstacles in nature? 
For example, the bumble bees. 
In a surprising draft presented at the CEATEC Japan, the bees were the starting point for Nissan's engineers to design the next generation of the system for prevention of collisions. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the guidance system of robotic cars BR23C rate imitator of nature, which gave him the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all the collisions . 
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval is actually very much like our cap security - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, director of MOP and technological development and research. 
They play an important role in the compound eyes of the bees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees. 
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the system for measuring the length by laser beam. 
This identifies the obstacles in front of BR23C within a distance of 2 meters at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle which immediately becomes a maneuver to avoid collision. 
In a fraction of a second identifying the obstacle, then the robot vehicle imitating the movements of the bees, amending the address to the extent required by turning the wheels. 
Unlike any currently existing system, this maneuver is totally instinctive. 
"If not, the robot vehicle could not react quickly enough to dodge obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Laboratory for Mobility and the draft of the robot vehicles. 
Should react immediately and instinctively, as this technology is for the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective cap security, in a layer inside of which are currently considered inevitable all types of collisions. 
The whole process should reflect what makes a bumblebee to dodge other bees. 
This process must be conducted in an open and close your eyes. 
However, unlike the bees, the movement can not go up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of rotation of the wheels 
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bees to dodge other bees, used here only as a possibility for the robot movement of the car rolling and accelerated further slowing. 
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy density, meaning they have a life span longer than the lithium-ion. 
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive reaction and intelligent and not the processing capacity of the data, let alone the storage. 
This device on every second only to process some input signals and respond as appropriate. 
There is no need to store this data or to react instinctively with a logic based on data from previous exercises, and uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory. 
There was no need gigabytes of memories, or megabytes. 
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which according to calculations by Nissan, in ten years can be incorporated into the models produced in series. 
Another possibility for implementation is to incorporate the unit into a navigation system for GPS satellite for the driver to his destination, avoiding obstacles in its path. 
This name is already very expensive child 
Has prepared the written version of the law of the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars which will be implemented in several stages with the aim of buying bad loans from banks. 
The first phase will spend half the money. 
According to schedule the east coast during the consultations which lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported. 
We have achieved significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democrat chairman of the U.S. Congress, arguing that lack only formalize the agreement on a document. 
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the outcome of the commitment stated: this program will work and be efficient but more steps are still needed. According to Pelosi, is not about saving Wall Street, but turning on the bandwagon of the economy. 
The written version of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets, namely the Sunday before 8 pm, according to Washington time (ie before two in the morning of Monday, according to Central European Time ), Without causing a dramatic jump in the stock markets. 
On the bill called emergency law for economic stabilization of 2008, the first vote on Monday, the U.S. Congress and then the Senate. 
President George W. Bush on Saturday night and then Pelosi has consulted with the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protecting our economy - said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman. 
The program is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration to spend all the 700 billion dollars to buy securities of credit fund for poor quality. 
Now you can spend only half of the 700 billion dollars, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress vote, probably on Monday, this amount of the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of fund credit, bad grade and fate of another 100 billion dollars depends on the decision of the president. 
This program will be monitored by a special agency, which also involved the Federal Reserve chairman. 
The other half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent after a new decision of the Congress. 
By law the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: You can buy bad loans at the same time, mortgages and securities of credit fund, plus other credits such as "poisonous" as well. 
The purchase may be done by auction or by direct - competent persons from the ministry reported. 
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the portfolio of finance guarantees the disturbing elements by which companies pay the charges for the foreseeable harm. 
Henry Paulson said, the law says so the necessary financial means, which can reach up to even 700 billion dollars to meet urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, be it the purchase of financial ill, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some major financial institutions. 
Do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law in regard to sign it - he said. 
Instead, the heads of banks that are in distress and expect aid from the State may rely on the limitation of their official compensation, that the American slang simply called golden parachutes. 
Only in certain limited cases be limited payments, in addition to the limitations depend on the form of help from the ministry of finance. 
The restriction means that if the ministry purchase as part of an auction, a tax shall be imposed parachutes for the extra gold, unless you retire the head of the failed bank. 
By buying directly bad loans the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that compensation of the chiefs are not exaggerated. 
Besides the above are not going to change the contracts of golden parachutes existing constraints relate only to new contracts and also to encourage participation in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that is in effect a statutory limitation to the earnings of general managers - said the measure Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the committee of Congress, responsible for financial services. 
The state will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, and will reduce the risk of taxpayers, since it ultimately may even gain with the transaction as the economy recovers and with it the bank. 
According to the bill in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal on how to how to return to taxpayers losses in the financial sector. 
Of course there were those on both sides expressed their reservations about the project. 
Is this not what we are instructed American citizens, that is they are not protecting the dollars of taxpayers - said the Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa. 
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said, the measures urged them so that they are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Press reviews of the German-speaking area 
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became more aware voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak outcome of the election CSU in Bavaria. 
Haider and his followers are ready to govern in a coalition to prevent Austria rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the online edition of German magazine leftist Franz Walter, in his article titled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours his parents' analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of CSU. 
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had started long before the sad Huber-Beckstein duo had taken office. 
The Social Christian were developed over several decades to Bavaria - and now just these modern citizens are the ones who give it back. 
The change of an era is both a problem of every Christian democracy, and also of Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday ended a process that is already provided for almost ten years: missing the undisputed hegemony of one party state. 
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU won a 47.7 per cent for the first time below 50 percent since the fifties. 
This was repeated three years ago, in the Bundestag elections of 2005, ie even during the long era of Stoiber said. 
The reason is the consistent upgrading of the CSU in the province devours his parents. 
Sociologists and 40 years ago are predicting that, but the pace was much mistaken. However, secularism, the results of education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had its negative impact on the accuracy of the voters of the CSU. 
With the modernization will also increase the possibilities and it also has political consequences. 
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the voters more aware, more critical and more stubborn. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks fairly conventional groups of citizens that were left over CSU, the self-employed, small industrialists, who have high school and graduates. 
So recudió to less than 40 percent support for the CSU. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
The conservative daily in Vienna: "Who with whom? In his article titled" The presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of coalition "- dealing with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs. 
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate the green on the other hand still do not want to make consultations on the coalition. 
And the elections were held now everything revolves around the coalition in the debate on public television, party leaders left little to see something from their decks. 
Faymann Werner, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to prove that it is possible collaboration between the two parties - this already exists in some provinces and social associations. 
Fayman left open the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, in the post of deputy foreign minister. 
He stated that in any event disapprove the era of Schüssel-Molterer. 
You can not follow this trend in politics. 
Molterer reacted cautiously to the offer red. 
He said he probably will not be successful if the cooperation Faymann trying to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP. 
It is still open in the party if elected opposition or enter into the coalition, these issues should be discussed without a doubt, within the ÖVP. 
The chairman of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was open in all directions. 
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of the government" - said Haider. 
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today it has launched the European summit in Paris for Equal Opportunity, his host is France that this year is also the president in turn of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party by Fidesz, in his message addressed to the full, as one of the main speakers at this meeting professional, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict Gypsy children and is also the biggest impediment to the prevailing foundation of their interests. 
This high-level conference was opened - the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, social partners and representatives of the most important European organizations for the protection of social rights. 
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the group of deputies from Fidesz in the European Parliament - said that in addition to employment discrimination, the Roma are outside the labor market in the first place by their low educational level. 
"Most of the young Gypsies have not completed secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university diploma." 
Járóka further stressed that education as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing foundation for other human rights too. 
The investment in the education of Gypsy children at a young age can strengthen the economies of member States of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues widely between and among non-gypsies as Gypsies. 
So while earlier a school student gypsy, will have more chances to become an active member of the labor market through the income tax and consumption they also contribute to the national budget. 
"For the Gypsies, as European Union citizens, we must assure the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated education and low-level" - highlighted Lívia Járóka. 
According to the MEP, is needed unity and active objective of the European Union to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for it is of fundamental importance the proper enforcement of existing and planned anti directives. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, unemployment and segregation, we have to offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights" - demanded Járóka. 
The objective of the European summit for Equal Opportunity organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities," is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European level and at national level in Member States. 
CSU: grace for a transitional period 
In late October a decision on the fate of the duo failed Huber-Beckstein 
Despite the serious electoral defeat, have not yet been cut off heads in the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment has been postponed discussion on personal matters. 
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it was not known how long lasting grace. 
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, to be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held the last weekend of October. 
The members of the much criticized duo hinted: not cling to their posts. 
This sought to reassure angry members of his parliamentary group and its grassroots organization, who one day after the "tsunami Bavarian" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority. 
Five years ago - albeit under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Social Union reached 60.7 percent, on the other hand now, a year after the coup crowded against Stoiber gained only 43, 4 percent. 
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP. 
While in the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate in the future will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with anyone. 
As a first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of the possible successors to Huber, also has a seat on the small intelligence group to start negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Voters Free right on a possible coalition government in Munich. 
The strange thing is that the destination on the list of Electors Free enters the parliament he Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was taken advantage of for coup and Beckstein-Huber duo then deleted scene of the cruelly ambitious local politics. 
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein. 
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now the cords were moving in the background, the former head of the provincial government and former president of CSU called the Sept. 28 as the day most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his view would have deserved much more support from the sister party. 
CSU's other politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel's own as well. 
After the elections of September 2009 the Bundestag, Chancellor Merkel will not be if they are unable to jointly enhance the CSU who played a crucial role in the success of national elections in 2005. 
According to Merkel that could hardly hide his disappointment at the failure, loss of the CSU does not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin. 
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the Social Democrats continuing crisis. 
The SPD with its 18.6 per cent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
The opposition to Lukashenko: 110-0 
After Sunday's elections, there will be no deputy Belarusian opposition in parliament. 
According to observers Russians, this is explained to the welfare and stability in the country ensures that Aleksandr Lukashenko, by contrast according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather with violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes. 
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result. 
While the legislature of the country of 10 million, composed of deputies and ten percent, more than a decade ago had no opposition before the elections yesterday the opposition united under the name United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko , Which for the fourth time, renewed its mandate after the 2006 election of questionable legitimacy, by consequence of the amendment to the Constitution this time "would allow" the entry of some opposition MPs in parliament. 
So the ODSZ lifted the boycott originally wanted to do. 
In the background of expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which ever more economically dependent on Russia - which took credit for moderating the import of natural gas becoming more expensive in Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz , Owner of the pipeline passing through the country - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, which does not give permission for entry to Lukashenko and other senior politicians for having a political system considered undemocratic. 
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE to assess the election campaign, put more emphasis on positive events and not about the mistakes - such as the ban imposed on third part of the opposition candidates. 
But the report's primary Monday of the OSCE criticized even own campaign - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes. 
With all this in view of the opposition is an improvement in the political climate: were released political prisoners and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Georgia Abhasia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - a month ago and believes the two regions as independent. 
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that it has initiated the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich. 
According to the opposition candidate for the presidential election of 2006 is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even a parliament without opposition at that weight." 
The opposition has no plans to organize protest demonstrations to see the results, rather trying to get their message to voters about the need to make economic reforms. 
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more that support the change among adults as well - said Milinkevich , Alluding to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main outcome is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate or even pensioners, who officially are the most subsidized by the regime. 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of the cemeteries" - believed Milinkevich. 
Observers Russians unlike the opposition politician described as democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People did not believe in words but in deeds," so that the absence of the opposition is none other than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters. 
Brunetta: "From now on will have breakfast before starting work" 
It has not happened ever in the history of Palazzo Chigi to put automatic doors to control entry and exit of personnel. 
but from today begins with this measure against whom tab and then goes to a coffee bar in working hours. 
This development has been unveiled today by Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the secretary general of the presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The automatic door-Brunetta said - are a tool to work better with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister. 
"Now it opens a new season of accountability and transparency. 
This is reform, "emphasizes again Brunetta. 
Palazzo Chigi with the installation is complete in all buildings of the presidency. 
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view." 
It has not been met with resistance by employees, says the secretary general: "a change has been shared by workers and there was cooperation on the part of the same." 
In short, no more breakfast in working hours, no more coffee and croissants. 
Word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 o'clock in the morning is a holy hand." 
During a convention at the Superior School of Public Administration 
Rome, the minister said that "in three months absence due to diseases of public employees have been reduced from 50% to say 60 thousand people to work more in one year." 
He adds that it is necessary to pay more efficient Public Administration 
Italian, "which wage dynamics - explained the minister - in the past 8-10 years have been double the private sector and well above the inflation TASO." 
For now, millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the rules of the decree Brunetta adhering to a request supported by the Codacons. 
"While the minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism from work due to illness - writes the association of consumption - the people of the 'lazy workers' is continually increasing. 
Million in Italy are actually employees of the correct and productive civil service that have joined together to declare war to the rules of the decree illegitimate. " 
In particular, the Tar reply was the exclusion of economic aggregates treatments for disease due because of service, the length of time in which belts are made visits medical check employee sick, and other aspects of the new provisions beloved by the minister. 
Accidents, Napolitano: "Prevention crucial" 
Each day, in Italy, are verified in the 2500 work accident, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled. 
For 2007, INAIL data actually confirm that the deaths have been about 1,200 white. 
Figures attest to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is a leading cause of death and almost twice as regards the deaths homicides. 
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this tragic matter, today the Anmil held in all provinces of Italy the 58 th National Day for the victims of industrial accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October . 
"The alarming data Anmil and broadcast on the same tragic news of recent days confirm soon be the crucial issue of prevention in the workplace," says the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association maimed and disabled for work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the continuing efforts of associations in favor of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, to assist the families of the victims and the public awareness ". 
"There has been a 'sufficient', sincerely share, faced with tragedies that, owing to its size, raise the cry of the media and public participation, change in the daily reality is proposing dramatic cases, even in its repeated dynamics. " 
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources is critical to invest in training and information. 
Particular significance taken numerous initiatives in school for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work. 
It is a duty to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, do not stop the alarm about the seriousness social, implement and improve legislation. 
For his part the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini has underlined "the phenomenon of white deaths are an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an urgent end". 
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight andamiento positive, but this does not detract from the fact that the number of deaths white is equally impressive," the president has rebranded the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want to, in effect, that this" trend of decline will translate into less attention, because this is precisely where the attention diminishes exploiting the tragedy. 
"We believe that a general is still too little to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions. 
Are necessary, in our view - has highlighted Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger statement about the training of workers, and this from the world of school. " 
"It serves as a further effort - he added - as it regards communication and public awareness. 
But it serves above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency. " 
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration in the standard of care provided to victims subsidiary of work" and "derivation of care towards which the system is running in recent years." 
"The goal is to restore the worker to guarantee safe - he added - because the fate of he who has no accident that depend on the gift prepared by the legislature every time." 
MP3 players under accuses put at risk the audition 
Listen to music at high volume for a long time using portable music devices like MP3 players can cause permanent damage to their hearing. 
As it is covered by the European Commission, which said in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee of the health risk emerging and newly identified (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today. 
"This scientific view - is read the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listening to music with portable music devices weekly by more than an hour a day taking the device to High-volume risking a permanent loss of hearing ability. " 
"My concern is the fact that a high number of young people so often use portable music devices and cell phones to high noise levels can ruin your ears unconsciously in irremediable way," said Meglena Kuneva. 
"From the scientific evidence - remains the responsibility Ue - emerge a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What counts is alert to consumers and to pay this public domain information. 
We must re consider, in addition to existing control systems in the light of this scientific view, to be effective and widely taken up with the new technology. " 
Brussels had asked Al Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable music devices and increasing the number of youths exposed to noise that it originates. 
"The scientists - concludes the executive Ue - confirm that is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and interested parties that could possibly take measures to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment. " 
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits to 100 dB noise level of portable music devices, but concern is increasing as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to greatly limit the damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels of exposure time to noise. 
In his view, The Scientific Ue ago that this was the users of portable music devices listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week over the limit currently in place regarding the maximum noise consented to the post work. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risking a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years. 
It means that affects 5-10% of the users of such appliances and the number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU. 
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of capital 
Today starts in March were closed in June will be the accounts. 
This is the timetable set by the municipality and employees of the "Commission for the future of the capital Rome," which was introduced this morning in its new home behind the Baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission discussed the main points for Roma. 
Once the doors closed in March, the board and the municipal council to assess and review projects, as presented in June, the Piano strategic Rome with the "bun official" from the council and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural rights - tend to emphasize Alemanno - to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which to decide politically, the board and the municipal council, may be guaranteed after . 
There is no overlapping of roles, only the desire to have a place to develop a great project for Rome. 
In March completion of the business will disappear, because this experience must have completed a temporary need. 
In June - the mayor announced - will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital Rome. " 
Anyone who accuses the Commission of pointless, given that their opinions are not binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality is present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as I am sure in Rome, their contribution will be vital. 
Almost always the policy is crushed in the ordinary into emergencies and that back in return manifest .. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look beyond long-term, a more profound foresight, working in earnest to the development of Rome and its future. " 
The mayor of Rome tends to point out that "this Commission is neither an entity nor a pointless banality: it is absolutely free, no coastal euro to a Roman citizen and will involve the best minds and think that gives the capital." 
For Alemanno, in effect, "you need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed nor static, to allow our city to make a real leap in the level, of which we absolutely need, thinking in a spirit unit to its future." 
A future that requires the mayor of Rome "is not limited only to existing municipal boundaries but to look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also considering the role that Rome can and should unfold as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
¿Obama? The first anti-American president. 
He has written a well-known American political interests you go through an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with their decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube links (as it does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
Increase the attacks against Obama while on the election date. 
has written a lady from Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a great stone face: believes that winning the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators. " 
They are in fact attacks that do not say much; attacks are clearly racial in nature and do not answer the question for voters: Will it be a good president? And then there are the polls, all say that Obama won with a great advantage. 
Here too there who speaks from the heart but not with the brain. 
A diary of Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth we will know well who will give their vote to the American patriot. 
Leaves one side of the American mentality taken cover up to the last. 
"Say what you want, let us then where to put the cross on whether Obama or McCain." 
There are people who swear: if you win Obama, we will we go to America. 
these things never before now, it seems almost certain that the success of the black candidate. 
Yet despite all these arguments, the weapon of democracy is the winner for George Bush. 
1500 people have asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent replied: Iraq. 
Change America. 
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent home to kick in the butt. 
In 4500 Iraq are soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make bags. 
Similarly, Iraq for most has been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will assume the post of George W would have a tremendous duty to unfold. 
Use the economic collapse is being felt also for journalists: in the newspapers it's time to cut it. Many give the blame to the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper. 
Five American journalists have been challenged by PEW Research Center on the state of his profession and mind control for the future. 
Although today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future. 
However, journalists have not openly declared feel less worried about credibility. 
They do not feel as isolated once. 
The problem for journalists is the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
Besides the cuts made in the room where editors are working to make the newspaper, is a big problem. 
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want the traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is reduced substantially. 
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today on the American journalist. 
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level following a wrong path. 
In the field the local executive group is 65%. 
Printed against broadcast. 
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going. 
The major publishing houses are creating a divide on the Internet, for many view as a "murderer" of the letter printed. 
The "economic pressure" to warn the journalists has increased to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that do some good for journalism. 
The biggest break in journalism today is between American who heads the newspapers - or directors - and the journalists who work for them. 
56% of executives at the national level is sure that its journalists share the same values, while locally the percentage drops to 23%. 
For some this has to do with the "job security". 
The executives who think losing the job in 3 years are 47% nationally. 
For the journalistic staff is 30%. 
What's "safe" level staff (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists working with a contract. 
In a vast nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet employers often provide what they want and then becomes a matter of "take it or leave it". 
The directors are almost always good wages, while the writers can earn up to 10 thousand dollars a month, plus retirement and social insurance. 
For the holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a full day of the first year, another third after 15 days to reach full after a certain number of years. 
But American journalists, by his own admission, was "sick" continued during the year. 
It's all a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, HE IS DAVID COPPOLA in Grottaferrata 
The chairman of the second section of the criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate Danilo Coppola that he had asked to move to their city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola is investigated by bankruptcy in the field of research on the pact against climbing on the Unipol-Bnl. 
During the process of arrest to his post last week, has secured the release home, transforming it into a residency requirement Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the property might go the route of the city of the province until a room in the capital. 
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has given contrary vote) would allow it to influence their society and access to evidence that accuse him. 
The elites in danger 
The phenomenon had already expressed a few days ago with the votes of the representatives of the camera against the plan of salvation of $ 700 million launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy. 
It gives us a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, but always divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, pro-federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul In contrast, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington and the world of finance, especially strong in the states of Central and South. 
The soul, in fact, has become arrogant with a vote of those who spoke at the beginning. 
This just said is just one example of mutations of major mutations, that the current economic earthquake announces: not just in the United States but in all the West and not just here alone. 
Whether in the United States and Europe have long crisis seems to function as an accelerator of phenomena that incubation with the new climate solidify and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the re update, the extraordinary revival of the double-category state sovereignty in relation to a kind of re nationalization of the economy. 
The crisis is indeed a crisis of bank-funded institutions which have, yes, strong relationships financed externally, but above are much more committed to the balance sheets of households living in a single country and in a single state. 
Which immediately creates a political problem for whoever governs it: that is how to respond to difficulties and protests from those people and those families who, on the other side are voters. 
The global financial crisis appears but is politically and exclusively national. 
The political internationalism seems substantially out of play or do not have much to say, the crucial test is the European Union that divided as ever between the different interests and different strategies state is not enough to decide any policy in common. 
It is the government of each state that everyone was expecting a speech, plans to rescue and recovery, new rules and above the grant funds: from the moment you arrive at court is the only state that has the economic resources and the mass Resource finances to remedy things. 
And also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two invaluable resources, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization can probably never have the same extent. 
This new emphasis on the crisis put the nation-state is in perfect harmony, always with the utmost importance that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a very Subsidiaries to that element: territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced they have entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will change that make the accounts each Again with the little intangible things such as water, crops and oil. 
All things which, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in absolute mode in a confined space, a territory. 
So who is as sovereign, certainly has many more cards does not matter who you are, and who has the misfortune to live in a post with no crops, no oil and no water. 
The second came novelty but it presages a fracture. 
Whoever said Territory, State, Government, unavoidably said Policy and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis seems to produce two phenomena converge. 
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of one who knows how to take in hand the situation. 
On the other hand a wave of doubt on the existing leadership, kind of inappropriate economic relieved with many gray areas. 
And together something more profound and disturbing in a sense: a discredited, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in increasing numbers. 
Always seems to be moving more, in various locations of the population, rather than the conviction that his actions are the same as those of the social elites until now booming, the same feel and to mode of being, their culture at the end of the comprehensive emergency , To have done the same time and be more alien to the views of the majority. 
The demand for leadership, in short, it feeds an underground movement branched but powerful delegitimization of the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which are manifested in a "revolt" in the election or sudden changes in collective moods of recent times Since the departure in conservative Bavaria-Austria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, the rebellion of men in the American Congress against Bush (and layered with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their format one would say, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent what it is today since taking so are the deep strata of Western society and that the renewed economic crisis, growing agitated and potentially excessive. 
Faced with all this talk of a "mass revolt" today is frankly exaggerated. 
But take your eyes open certainly is not. 
The super glue to walk on walls 
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future to walk on walls like Spider Man. 
Is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes is near enough. 
With a sticker of just 2.5 square centimeters scientists have been able to have stuck a corps of 100 kilos on a vertical wall. 
STUDY - The American magazine Science published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of the carbon, called carbon nanotubes. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti" explained Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have been inspired to foot the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can assure the animal a perfect grip. 
The test made on different materials such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful legs of the reptile and at the same time "is easily off the walls" says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton. 
WALK BY THE WALLS? - "This material could be useful as an adhesive transitional" said Liming Dai. 
Layers to walk around the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers, but the researchers think to use a lot less fascinating as the connection between electronic devices because the carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current. 
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering. 
At the moment none of superheroes. 
ANOTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley in California, is being devoted to the search for a new adhesive. 
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, the scholars Californians have submitted an adhesive made of micro fiber like hair that is self-cleaning during the movement of dust on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip. 
Drugs: never with fruit juice 
Attention to the grapefruit juice, the orange and apple. 
These drinks, consummate especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaneously with some drugs is altered its absorption by amplifying or diminishing as the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health. 
At the risk of repeating the fruit juices that are packed fresh associated with the assumption of certain medicinal David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236esimo national meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia going to send a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, negating the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The grapefruit juice was already under state accuses because it retained responsibility for toxic levels to raise some medicinal anti arrítmicos, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological. 
A DRUG RISKS - The Italian drug agency had given the news in a bulletin of information two years ago alarmed doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this stemmed blending and pay attention to things is drunk in the case is assuming a drug such as a Diasepam or methadone. 
NOT JUST THE GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts also orange juice and apple contain substances that inhibit the drugs. 
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices. 
Hence the call Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the University of Milan state: "These findings in general is brought to the various agencies of international and national drug that would eventually change to provide the same briefing notes. 
That is why we must always read the brochures of medicinal and assume that if there is something that we have no clear, let us not impress, clearly ask the doctor or the pharmacist "stressed the expert from the agency Ansa. 
Novel of the economy to Paul Krugman 
The Nobel Prize in economics has been assigned to American Paul Krugman for their studies, their trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the actions of the Bush administration with regard to the economy and foreign policy. 
A few months after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in those days che gorge Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by The New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, finished in consequence for the United States . 
A forecast that sparked much controversy, and that for several years came accuses the economy, but now it has proved accurate. 
"I am surprised and a little upset by the scandal as the memory of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom have disappeared quickly from public attention," Krugman had declared the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist, but also a discloser with a style as" very aggressive, especially critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. " 
Open Office, echoed the third edition package of "anti-Microsoft ' 
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source productivity suite that staff always looks to attract more users, from home to office to the professionals of public administration, as an alternative to free-known Microsoft Office. 
After working for nearly a year of volunteer developers, including their backs are monitored by Sun Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several developments: the Welcome screen interface and the magazine less rude, will be more consistent, as support for the Apple operating system Mac OS X and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version. 
Attention is also putting the multi operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (. Docx,. Xlsx,. Pptx). 
Some interesting features of some specific modules such as one that reduces the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful, for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the form of graphic design, preserving the original appearance of page. 
Always on this front can create documents "PDF hybrids," which accumulate typical of the graphic format from Adobe with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor. 
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements in the interior of applications: in the spreadsheet may be involved in a variety of users, avoiding conflicts of the changes in the production of texts, each partner is given a color in the remarked to a better recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are also working to bring some features of OpenOffice for the Web (on the cloud, above the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the final outcome. 
The Italian version can be downloaded in the direction http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and add to the English that was in the mirror from Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system. 
A request may also be sent from the installation cd home or work. 
And if the topic of free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, is in business area that the Open Office suite test, try the big bet, and may already have several projects in the public administration and in schools. 
And not even missing the realities that offer a service training, consultation and assistance ideal for small and medium enterprises, which could open prospects for business. 
Open Office is comprised of five main modules: Writer, for writing the video for Word, Calc is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel, Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of Access is known program that consents to work in the data base; and finally Draw graphic module. 
Goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million download, and considering that even today we came to almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the output of the new version is likely to be able to overcome the anticipated figure. 
Kohl is also positive is the fourth doping case 
New positive case in the Tour de France: it's Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, ranked third and won the best climber's shirt. 
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.

The analysis of the blood of champions Kohl fall between those made in recent weeks in the laboratory of Chatenay-Malabry and Lausanne. 
If the tests confirm that it is against positive, the Austrian lost third place at the Tour and anger against the two-year disqualification canonical. 
To confirm the news of the positive doping Kohl of the third generation of Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press had reported the news to the Austrian authorities. 
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned on the podium at the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and Cadel Evans of the U.S., T-shirt awarded the best climber. 
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS QUESTION, ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italian emigrant country has only recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants "received with hostility. 
This is transforming the country into a nation of beautiful racist? It wondered what the New York Times in an article that has long devoted to the discussion on the topic racism in Italy on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of cookies. 
This case as evidence that the New York Times defined the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are also those where there are "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and stand more North of the league high. " 
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants in the New York Times has also cited incidents of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Also the new legislation sought by the Lega presses the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of cambiamiento climate in Italy. 
Trend is marked by the Pope that the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism." 
Students of the victims lease expensive, up to 900 euros for a room 
The market rents for the university does not know the crisis. 
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a single room can cost a student 900 euros in Milan, Florence 700, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon has already taken very serious to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people by the soaring costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the office responsible for the studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these Cities strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase up to the residents. " 
A party that in most cases offers rentals contain a series of violations: Free standard contracts, unregistered, with no limit fees, rents sub linked. 
Sunia interventions are needed for overtime, through the revision of taxation, they can regulate prices. 
Looking in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, on a bed in Brianza area, serving about 450 euros for a single room from a minimum of 650 (area Bande Nere) to a mean value of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and Fiera ) To a maximum of 900 (area in Victoria). 
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, serving 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for an individual. 
In Rome in central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) you ask around 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room. 
Only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
It is only by changing economy peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in zone Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings. 
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with prices highest in areas Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euro, at least a 350 per individual. 
More girls in the cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight on the economy of the city. 
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rent to students and outside is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the fee for foreign students regarding the Italians. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the city canceled the historic rooms 
The cinemas closed favoring the historical Multiplex. 
"A city without cinemas in town blind, is like a face without eyes." 
The image given by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer effectively with what is happening in large urban centers and also in the Italian cities of province. 
The process of marginalization of the theater, with the meticones birth of the great in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in central areas of the city, is an inevitable event and undisputed with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime . 
A disappearing historic sites are almost always full of memory, "it is as if a dying friend, an acquaintance with which it shared a piece of place and so much emotion," notes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago ago won the first Oscar and the grand prize at Cannes jury, which included poetry in a movie theater and the province of nostalgia for the way to live the movies that perhaps lost forever. 
The figures given by ANEC, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the past five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most of the rooms are overcoats major cities: 10 least in Florence, at least 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Roma, 6 at least 5 in Turin and Palermo. 
Among the regions most experienced by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romagna, with 82 cinemas least, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for her disappearance is the compromise of the multiplex, is itself that these three Italian regions have recorded the highest number of new cinemas meticones: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the past five years, 81 in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
"The exercise has been developed Italian irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it would be useful to build new structures but would be required to ensure the retention of those already in existence, because when a town hall closes, not all of his frequent readiness with the meticones transferred. 
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is around 10 million euros. 
It is shameful from the point of view of ethics and morality, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year. " 
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that concerned about the closures, decided repaired with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and ANEC, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema hall is a monkey in the historic center that in the periphery. 
Among the rules provided there are ways of facilitating tax in favor of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and have special rates for parking. 
"It is an initiative that I like 'notes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures. 
It is true that in contrast to the extra power of meticones, traditional cinemas have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience is more demanding today. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is an issue which for me was always important: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do the "New Cinema Paradiso", which has already been thought 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, they step forward to the Rialto or at the Quirinale via Nazionale closed, where I have lived so many emotions shared, for not seeing the posters blackened by dust, I turn to the other side. " 
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, had been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections to the Municipal concerned to cosc Piromalli." 
They are the heavy accuse the judges of the Directorate of Calabria anti give the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association. 
Gioacchino Piromalli also arrested, the clan elder and mediator between the government, and his grandson attorney, namesake of the boss, and convicted of criminal association mobster and compensate 10 million euros. 
"Disregard any rule of law and morals, and good sense," wrote prosecutors, the two local governments had expressed willingness to pay the lawyer Piromalli consultations. 
"It would have been possible for the mafia family - write the judges, officially entering the township's internal facilitating the strong possibility of the control and command of public administration." 
The chairman of the board Calabrian regional Agazio LOIERO not hiding that "agreements between the poor organized life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the intensity mafia is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable. 
But there are so many local politicians to resist pressure from the 'ndrangheta, which is kept clean heroes. " 
The arrested this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the cutting head of the family mobster Piromalli. 
Since the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, and in 1991, provided by alleged conditionalities between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been solevados Engagement of administering the town. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, after the ballot to May 2006, was elected as head of a coalition of center-right. 
A scandal exploded when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
Call into question the deputy interior minister at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized mainly by a political issue, but judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning Piromalli to explain that he had come to ask for the change in the draft the highway A3. 
Of the interceptions made to environmental Torrione Dal, the judges wrote, emerge "a willingness to promote the demands of a businessman, representative of a group close to the clan Piromalli, standardizing the election of public administration over the interests of the mafia families" . 
When the power comes from the waves, down to the big stage 
It occupies a site that wiped more than 70% of the planet's surface and are discovering now, the major global energy companies. 
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources over which look like large Chevron. 
The possibility of raising energy of the movements of the sea is studied for a hundred years and in the 70s along with the first oil crisis, the investigations were intensified. 
When the price of oil low, in 1980, the idea of using energy navy was aloof, but now that the cases of environment and the renewed increase in oil give impetus to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electrical need could be filled implants by exploiting the movement of waves of the sea. 
That amount would double the currently produced by nuclear power plants. 
And would the currents and tides. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first company to bet on energy navy has been Enersis, which by 2005 had sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal. 
When the intention was announced seemed like a revolutionary step. 
After two years away to bet on energy and navy are always more among these companies which have always voted for traditional energy. 
"Chevron is exploring the technology on ocean energy - said the spokesman for a company associated with the oil giant has to the U.S. economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us." 
The cooperation is concerned about obtaining a permit from the committee for the American energy to carry out a project for exploiting marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a very important signal, if one considers that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to conduct further drilling. 
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. New York and New Jersey's Ocean Power to the path of the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although they are not detailed indicate a growing interest. 
Technology to develop. 
Experts speak of a technology still in the beginning, because energy navy has no doubt that a great environmental impact. 
For now impacts as those Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not appear to create major problems for the ecosystem. 
To produce energy at large scale, you should use a technology with a greater environmental impact. 
And the choices are many: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of coupled including boas. 
The force of the waves, which move boas up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them. 
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn feeds a generator. 
The electricity is sent to shore via submarine cables. 
For now there are four such implants in developing, awaiting only the approval of federal, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, by contrast, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York. 
The movement of the water when there are tides, the spinning blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular concern, say at the Institute for the development of electric power, merit at this time the potential of the tides. 
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are preventable but the wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable source of energy. 
It is above all about the power of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who are close to the coasts, have invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and is planned an investment of 35 million for the 2009.
