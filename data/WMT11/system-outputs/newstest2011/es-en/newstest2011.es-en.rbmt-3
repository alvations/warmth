What is counted? The ČSSD in Prague knows not neither to Voldemort nor the confectionery
The new councilmen of the ČSSD in the capital are going to have to overcome, as it seems, the clear language barriers so that the components of the Meeting of Prague and of the Town council understand his renewed partners of the ODS.
The period Aktuáln ě. cz it "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to verify his knowledge of the language marked slang that it has arisen in the last years in the Advice, when the current members of the coalition were governing Prague.
The codified dictionary that was using the flower and political cream of Prague during the previous period, of mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the personages, situations and causes more known about the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proved that the new councilmen almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least, they say that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know it."
"Rather I am a beginner in the politics praguense," affirmed during the terminology examination of "colegueo" the councilman of culture Luká Kauck ý.
And as for political veteran, equal Karel Březina reacted.
Perhaps know the concept "hole of golf."
"Possibly be the only expression of all that you asked me that I use occasionally."
"If not, normally I do not use slang."
Of the glossary, which definitions he published the newspaper Aktuáln ě. cz last June before the congress of voting of the ODS, the writing chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "major hole of golf of Prague," "go to the confectionery," "nape of bull," "treachery of the capital" and "reinforce."
Three councilmen accepted to surrender to the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, which in future will be responsible for the education in Prague, at first gained access, but it did not take the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused to do it straight.
"I neither get into these things nor think to value how democrats entertain them civic."
"What yes matters for me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs," it pointed out.
Since one has seen, supposedly the councilman Luká Kauck ý had not realized that the previous title is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of exmayor Bém, Roman Janou ek.
ý the word "Voldemort" does not say his anything to Kauck; the only term that was right in the examination is "the biggest hole of golf of Prague."
"It is a question of the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck ý, that adds immediately: "But rather I know it for the news."
"I go to have to point at a languages course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one that recognizes in the golf hole the tunnel Blanka, but also the councilman of Environment Luká Plach ý.
Later, both sociodemócratas know who Voldemort is really and Luká Plach ý enclosed knows where to find this personage; also, he suspects the meaning of "going to the confectionery."
"I believe that it means to go to a company of Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plach ý that it is a question of the head office of the companies of Janou ek.
As Březina, indicates that you should fell the knowledge it obtained them of the news, but that such a vocabulary does not use.
According to the participants in the test, between the sociodemócratas no so familiar glossary of colloquial terms exists.
"I asked my partners, but really it seems that we do not have similarly at all."
"Rather, between we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or do words games with the names," says the president of the ČSSD praguense, Petr Hulínsk ý, whose party partners call Hulda.
"In the school they were calling me Bříza, but I do not know if my partners also call me like that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuáln ě. cz the name put itself to the test and it works.
For his party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old man), the representative Miroslav Poche, with which tricks collaborated before the elections during the patronage of the party, receives the nickname of "Igráček" ("playmobil") on the part of some of his partners.
The nicknames also are the only expressions that the sociodemócratas tolerate in the speech inside the party.
Hulínsk ý does not like that they call him Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln ě. cz it discovered even other nicknames for this president praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of the bludgeons" as it seems he remembers that Petr Hulínsk ý obtained his doctorate in Right in the academy of police officer of Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "witches," as he published in a leaflet
The women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The women that enchanting "become" are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm to the rest of the people.
"The men rarely suffer such but."
"One does not also isolate the healthy young women, because they help in the works and have children," tells a nun that, in the capital of the state of western Africa Burkina Faso it deals in a special residence of more than hundred women expelled from his communities.
The Local government has decided to be opposed to this unusual "social measurement."
It expressed an informative leaflet that should help to avoid the hunting of witches.
Nevertheless, this has a snag.
"Any more than 70% of the adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of the sensitization in writing.
The witchcraft accusations also are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, nearby country of Burkina Faso, last week 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died, when three women and two men tortured it, they covered it of gasoline and burned it.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors affirm that circumstances heap owed to a poor wretch.
According to his version, the woman caught fire on the oil that is used for the ritual anointings.
It caught fire on flames when the group wanted "to expel the villains spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" is supported by persons of all the educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman of Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always represented a danger," affirmed.
While in Burkina Faso the Government tries to pacify the hunting of witches, in Gambia last year the president still took part in her.
"The Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, threw a wide hunting of the witches who, supposedly, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the proper president by means of the black magic."
"To help him it brought shamans of the near Guinea who protected by police officers, military men and the personal escort of the president, took by force men and women chosen randomly between the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kanilai," points out in his report the organization International Amnesty.
In the farm, the brave persons had to drink a grasses potion with hallucinogenic effects that, also, provoked intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the brave ones did not survive the stay in the farm.
After the international pressure, finally they liberated about thousand arrested persons.
The Bakala tenant: it warms up with coal heaters and signs a higher rent
The man, of advanced age and thick, crossed the doors of the center of attention to the client of the company RPG Byty of the "magnate of the coal" Zdeňek Bakala, the biggest owner deprived of apartments in rent in the Czech Republic.
Down the arm was taking a few documents with the new contracts of rent of three apartments: his, that of his daughter and that of his son, who is fulfilling judgment.
It has just caught the liberalization of the rents from the three.
Instead of 3.500 Czech crowns a month, the son will pay from next year 4.100 crowns for an apartment of two stays with kitchen separated from the second category.
"Also, he has not warm water and the heating is based on a cauldron of solid fuel," the man shows with the finger in the new contract of his son, on whose signature has full powers.
"But I signed it," he tells angry way, given up way.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which qualified the new rent conditions like "incorrect and indecent," he recommends to the tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, date in which a guide will publish informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, the man just does a gesture.
"Everyone says a thing," he says with pout.
Ostrava is turning into a big laboratory of tests of the liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were until now under a regular rent.
That's why, Aktuáln ě. cz he decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The mining RPG waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and, Tuesday at nine o'clock, already was full.
Just along with the doors the safety guards are and next to you a machine to take number.
"Rent 2011," it can be read in a luminous button of his tactile screen.
On having touched it, a bit of paper goes out of the machine with a number.
Almost he has not time not to read "157" and the number appears already on the big screen placed on top of the room.
In a second, you are in the tail.
Soon, there comes a marriage of advanced age to be asked, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rents.
Most of the people come to solve habitual problems, as formerly: requests of arrangements, questions of the insurance and similar matters.
The letters with the new rent contracts will come in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of 44.000 apartments belonging to RPG about middle of November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase of the rent to them of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18 a special window is opened in the center of attention to the client for the new rents.
"Ride working one week, so it is starting," they answer, after doubting briefly, the workpeople who are in her when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The liberalization and the ancient apartments for miners of Bakala are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, already the vice-president of the Parliament treated high place and skylight, native of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new soil."
"They did not even change the damned plate of the bath to me," the man mentioned in the introduction lets off steam.
According to the workpeople, for the time being they come more than not retired at all to verify if they receive a discount in the rent if they sign on time, as it promises the special RPG offer.
There will receive also half of the discount on the February rent the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15.
Nevertheless, the window of the mining "liberalization" undoubtedly does not manage to remove the doubts avalanche.
"Of 360 clients who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty persons asked for the rent in 2011," the employee of the window estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes in the web and in his planks to realize individual meetings on the contracts when it is necessary.
If two parts do not come to an agreement on the rent, an independent judge will have to solve the question.
"It is not a question of a threat, but of information about the only way to proceed possibly and completely in accordance with the law," warns RPG on his pages.
"Here it goes not to judge anybody," thinks one of the employees about RPG Byty and a man who is in the street opposite to the center of attention to the client gives him, at least partly, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13.000 and I have left 5.000 for the meal; I have no means to come to the courts," he affirms.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We will see already."
"Mister Zaorálek warns them in the means that do not sign, so perhaps the people wait," he thinks.
The regulation of the rent will stop existing in most of the Czech Republic to beginnings of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, his increase is an economic need.
"The current rents still cover not even the quantities necessary for the maintenance of the fund of the community," remembers Pavel Klime, the director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the fund of the community that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the principal reason to increase the rent.
While during five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in apartments four billions, in four years that from 2011 to 2014 will go the number will increase to 5.200 millions.
The big screen that hangs by the roof, opposite to the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some information that stand out in red.
"The increase of the rent in the year 2011 in 15% and less there is applied to 31.200 apartments, that is to say, more than 90% of the properties of RPG."
"Also, always it will be like a maximum 7,50 monthly Czech crowns for square meter," is indicated on the screen.
Only I increase in 38% the rent of 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, it is a question of an increase from a few extremely low quantities, of 19,66 crowns for square meter," indicates RPG.
In 2.600 apartments, the rent will remain invariable the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect suddenly to the rents, but it will be climbed between four to eight years.
Also, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the increase of the rent (I consulted the graph) again in the apartments, principally in saving in heating: new windows and heating.
There will have priority the persons who sign the agreement of increase of rent.
The architects have understood that the offices also need nursery school
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new head office of the company Arch. Design.
Nobody would say that he hides also in his interior a small nursery school with everything proper to such facilities: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a park in miniature in the exterior patio.
From October of last year, there can come to her the children of Arch's personnel. Design.
The company of architectural projects Arch. Design, of of whose study numerous buildings known about Brno went out, thought from the first sketches of the building Avriopoint of including a space for his mininursery school.
At the company about 90 persons are employed, principally at the age of the baby boom and they wanted to allow the architects and checkermen to be able to return soon to the work after the maternity.
Together with the possibility of enjoying a short time, the nursery school is one of the benefits that Arch offers. Design to his workpeople in the frame of his social program.
The constructors and architects this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The mininursery school was an idea of Arch's own personnel. Designu and, with the support of the direction, they managed to obtain financing of the European Union and of the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mininursery school of the company is financed across the European Social Fund in the frame of the operative Program of human resources and employment, as well as of the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing granted (an endowment of more than 2,8 million Czech crowns) they could buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When it exhausts the financing (two years), the company Arch. Design has the obligation to support in functioning the mininursery school with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the presentation of the request of financing he contributed the company Economy Rating.
The attention of the children is in hands of qualified personnel; also, there are present the whole day for his care a nurse and teacher of the Department of Education. The nursery school at present receives children without age limit, although most of them have less than three years.
Since it is a question of a "mininursery school," it can only receive simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The functioning of the nursery school is flexible to adapt itself to the needs of the parents and the children of all the workers have the same right to use the nursery school, independently of the hierarchy inside the company.
Although it is a question of an education and individual care, the contents of the program of the mininursery school are comparable to the program of the habitual preschool education.
In her the children not only play, but also they receive a quality education: from basic learning up to the preparation for the school, they teach up to English.
The class not only has toys and games of table, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of small children in the proper company to create a friendly and positive ambience.
The parents can go to see his children in any moment and avoid the stress of gathering late the children of the school when it is far from his work place.
This way, the parents are more productive while they work.
It does not turn out to be surprising that this generates of natural form an allegiance relation between the worker and his employer.
This way, Arch. Design is located between the companies they sign that they offer a big advantage for the admission of new workpeople: they support the family and, finally, this program reinforced the personnel marketing.
The house of the bones keeps on fascinating after 100 years. Observe the Gaudí interiors
The roof looks like the loin of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the open mouth of a fish.
Like that is the House Batlló, in Barcelona, to the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to his form similar to a skeleton, the places nicknamed "the house of the bones."
His organic forms, his showy colors, the novel use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a front that resembles the scales and the omnipresent lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays with oneiric lines, delicate colors and extracted textures of the nature and of the fauna.
Paying more attention, there is observed a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
In the night, the whole front of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the sheen of the colors is improved.
It winds and we keep on surprising the torsion of the forms also in his interior.
The wavy wood copies the frames of the windows, the rails, the adornments of the doors, the peepholes and the signs.
The House Batlló, which is in the Eixample quarter in the number 43 of the animated shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the reshaping of a house of the year 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in the year 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on knocking down the previous building and starting of zero, but soon he accepted the idea of Gaudí of realizing a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
Nevertheless, the House Batlló, formed by diverse apartments, alone Antoni Gaudí did not design it.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his planes of the project adornments arose for the apartment representative of the proprietor of the property and the mosaics used in the front.
In the front also workpeople other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the House Batlló was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol took part in the construction of the House Milá and of the park Güell de Gaudí, in which other pieces of the same one are.
Due to his organic form, the places shortly after his ending nicknamed "the house of the bones."
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening of the windows they began calling it "the house of the yawns."
It is said also that, on top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge appears, boss of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house the only system for the epoch of central heating with ventilation air vents and the typical chimneys.
His inclination of forty five grades can turn out to be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect by no means the norms of construction of the moment and does not allow to be influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in him the information indicated on the due reconstruction was so vague that, two years later, to his ending, the town hall remained so impressed with the result for that it asked that should correct.
It was bothering him, for example, that the construction was including columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never realized, rather on the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of the town hall, Josep Batlló requested (and it obtained) permission to rent the two highest apartments of the building.
In the low apartments the proper owner settled.
In the gallery of the second apartment the lounge was and in the third apartment the bedrooms and the part deprived of the apartment.
The first floor was rented to a jewelry shop.
The house, of six apartments, is completely crossed by a stairs that goes up to the patio of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them of curved walls.
Gaudí worked also with the modern concept of connection of the space.
The common part can get connected completely opening the doors of the lounges and a major group can communicate this way without problems, without one resigning from the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the Gaudí reconstruction, not only obtained a new front, but also an unusual roof and two additional apartments.
It turns out to be impressive also how it plays Gaudí with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the patio and fanlights.
The game with two colors contributes the light maximum in all the apartments of the house.
It was based simply on the beginning of which the target reflects more light than the dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the beams of the sun.
Any person can visit the House Batlló, which in the year 2005 was added to the list of world patrimony of the humanity of the UNESCO.
In the first apartment of the house there is the apartment most spacious and more recharged with the accessible ones to the public.
The proprietors decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a question of a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the garret, including the patio of the roof.
The price of the entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16,50 euros, although the students, the pensioners and the holders of the tourist cards obtain 20% of discount.
The amount overcomes greatly the price of the entry of other constructions of Gaudí in the city.
If he wants to enjoy the real ambience of the bed his lizard towers, friend should make quickly of some resident of the nearby houses and visit him at home.
How is the mattress and the somier chosen: the women and the men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really awards his quality to a good bed is the surface the mattress and the somier lie down, that is to say.
First of all they must complement each other to the perfection so that they adapt themselves to the concrete users.
During the election numerous elements enter game, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the proprietor.
Also the type of interior turns out to be important in the one that places the mattress and the somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a hut of weekend that usually does not have heating, latex mattresses must not be used because they "warm up" more slowly.
Also, they usually weigh greatly more than the habitual polyurethane mattresses.
Consequently, it turns out to be necessary to turn round them more often.
If the channels of the center are not aired properly and, superficially, they are on a strong basis, they support inside the moisture. Enclosed can turn out to be mold below.
At the time of choosing a bed, also they influence the customs.
The one who has spent a lot of time abroad, often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and it will have problems to feel good in a lower and hard surface.
"Almost all the players of hockey who returned of the NHL were complaining about that here were not sleeping equally of good."
"For his crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelástica layer."
"This type of mattresses is recommended to themselves also for persons with diabetes by that time problems of the nervous system, for what they get badly the information of the joints and of the skin," tells Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in the quilted furniture.
Many hockey players, as other clients, take time preferring the viscoelástica mattresses.
"Today there is already no problem, because they have this suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the mark checks Tropic."
It is already not necessary to be a player of the NHL to be able to appreciate the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes his rigidity and forms according to the absorbed heat or adapts itself to his corporal heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, it will not turn as after a divided five-peseta coin.
Simply, he falls asleep better.
The viscoelástica also works like protection from the ulcers.
On having chosen the size of the mattress, add to his height the length of his feet, that is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimal width for a person should be, in a double room, of 90 cm, in whole 180 cm.
In case of the single rooms, for example bachelors, between 120 and 140 cm are recommended like minimum.
So that a possible visit also is comfortable.
"If not, it is possible to apply a simple norm to calculate the breadth: after mouth lies down it arrives, it should have the hands comfortably shrunk towards the elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu čalouník ů to dekoratér ů, that already takes many years dealing with the problems of the healthy sleep and of the ergonomics of the furniture, topic that it teaches in the specializing schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own somier and mattress, so during the buy it is necessary to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
In the opposite case, it will be necessary to mount the somieres to different heights, which not always is possible in all the beds.
The foam mattresses should have a 14 cm minimal height, the models with wharves interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter they are for the layer that he adapts himself to the forms and smooths.
," On having touched it with the hand or on having made comfortable in the mattress, undoubtedly the wharves should not be evident," warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress needs a type of certain somier.
The completely quilted bedrooms, in which the mattress and the base are like Siamese, have no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe evil and it is not possible to wash his case, which today is done often.
And, since every night we perspire between 0,2 and 0,75 l of perspiration, it is clear that after approximately five or seven years the mattress us will begin reminding to a big one (and congested) sifter.
For this reason, the specialists push back the slogans that they speak about a life of the mattress of up to 25 years or, even, about a guarantee of for life.
Nevertheless, everything has one but.
That's why, the sellers give an advice: in the mattresses with a 120 or 140 cm breadth, deal carefully with the cleanliness and with the wash of the case, but better there adds a protector of mattress that could move back and to wash easily.
Although at present mattresses cases are made with zipper of all his perimeter, for what, on having opened them, they remain in two parts (slightly very important for the wash and the size of the washer!), his manipulation in the models of major size (and for only one it presents itself), on having raised the mattress, can look like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In the bed, instead of a somier: does it have a table firm?
Never!
Like much for the thought-out beds so that the visits happen one night.
Nevertheless, must do (if you already do not have) ventilation orifices in the table and it must be used by a mattress with wharves inside and a 15 cm minimal height with the wharves in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
The polyurethane mattresses must not be used on such bases.
For the plates somieres not articulables and that they contain between 14 and 18 plates, they can use mattresses of latex or mattresses sándwich (for example, a combination of latex and fibre of coconut), although a somier is always better with a major number of plates, 28 or more, in that the plates of the lumbar area are reinforced and it is possible to regulate his rigidity.
The plates somieres articulables must not be used by a wharves mattress, since it does not react to the reclinación.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the plates, it is possible to use also the shoulders protection.
It is a question of a special fixation of the plates that allows to press or, even, to incline the plates in such a way that they "make a detour" perfectly to the shoulders during the sleep.
For the men who have a few very wide shoulders, it is a question of something very important.
There even remember them the manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "masculine ones," began using a softer area precisely about the shoulders.
Also they remember the women, for whom they put a softer area concerning the hips.
For the most demanding clients, they exist somieres with structure in cross or of slats with the called muffling multitorsion.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is exempted.
It must bear in mind also that, although it uses the mattress and somier adapted, if he uses a bad pillow (big and "soft"), they will eliminate most of the advantages.
The norm basic is simple: the pillow must support the head and the corners can only come up to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same ones could relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On having lain down of side, the pillow must be at the same level (when it gets together with the somier with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest area of the mattress) that the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something to do, as it seems, with the stuffed original straw mattresses.
The manufacturers keep on using, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, you mix.
In fact, the biological mattresses are fashionable.
The prime matters by means of oil, with which the polyurethane froth is made, are refilled by natural oils, for example of castor-oil plant or soya.
In fact, practically all the well-known manufacturers use soya.
"Biological, in case of the mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," tells Petr Va íček of the company Tropical Bonus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the case of the mattresses, one of the first aloe will see.
But also it is possible to choose for the microcapsules, which liberate a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
Differences exist also for men and women.
While the men "freshen up" with vegetable breeze extracts, so that the case of the mattress absorbs the heat and refreshes the body, the women prefer to "warm" the case.
The extract of red pepper improves the circulation of the blood, so that the women feel more warmth.
The favorites at present?
The made mattresses of cold froth, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which does that they are more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of diverse rigidity of cold froth and viscoelástica they allow to make mattresses of diverse areas that know perfectly where there goes the head, the shoulders and the heels.
A mattress of good quality will cost him of seven thousand crowns for above.
Those who redeem a therapeutic function usually have a low VAT, since there are considered to be sanitary means.
The first one that obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It turns out to be complicated to save in the mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes there can be approved the offers of the manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the mark Magniflex offers mattresses Duofreeze with a froth with memory Memory adhered to the case for 11.990 crowns.
The second one is obtained free.
The age of the viscoelástica with an open cellular structure and a big thickness began with the "cosmic" Tempur material.
Initially it arose like material for the NASA, because during the blast-offs you praise astronauts were turning out to be submitted to an enormous surcharge.
Tempur is softened by the heat and hardens with the cold.
Consequently, the human, warm body, he exercises a perfect effect and adapts ideally his pressure.
Consequently, it is ideal to prevent from producing ulcers to him, although also to improve the serviceability during the sleep.
The froth viscoelástica not only is used in the mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as his circulation.
The national manufacturers, for example, use the froth Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
More and more parents use devices of persons' pursuit to control his children
The fear for the children leads every time more persons to thinking of controlling them for GPS.
The system initially thought for the pursuit of vehicles, also can continue the movement of the persons and contribute this way, for example, in case like the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
For the time being the device has the approximate size of a box of matches, but soon it will come down to the size of a clock.
Many people there scared the case of the missing person Anička and began finding out on the means available for protecting better his children.
Even at the cost of invading his privacy.
"We all try to say to ourselves that it is not a question of spying, but of another way to diminish the possibilities that a tragedy takes place," thinks Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of pursuit devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in certain cases, it is possible to abuse such devices, for example if they get into the purse of someone without his knowledge, but we still have not come across with such cases."
"Most of the clients really buy it for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, the children should always know why the "box" serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
The infantile psychologist Damages Bočková warns on the fact that, if the child does not want to take it, simply it will throw it.
"Even the smallest children show big creativity at the time of losing deliberately certain things if they want to prevent from controlling them."
"Earlier, the parents were trusting enormously in the mobiles, but these could go out as easily as the pursuit device," affirms Bočková.
In his opinion, it turns out to be debatable if in case of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a question of a prepared sequestration, the author practically always will verify if the child takes some type of electronic device that could reveal his place."
"Now it is the phone."
"As there is spreading the use of the devices of pursuit, also he will look for them, since his sale undoubtedly will be realized by many publicity."
"In such cases, the delinquents always go a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
Nevertheless, he adds that such devices can help in case of an unexpected attack of a pedófilo.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers pursuit services both for vehicles and for persons, even in case, after an attack, the pursuit device is destroyed immediately, his presence can serve as help.
"It is possible to form the device so that he sends regularly the position after a certain period."
"If it incurs losses, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have integrated an inclination meter, therefore if the person simply one slips and it remains immobile, the device will express immediately a warning with the position in question," affirms Čech.
In his opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with the intelligent mobile phones with navigation, in which only a special software must settle.
The problem of the current units of pursuit is that for the time being it is a question of devices with a size similar to a box of matches or the mobile phones of minor size.
Therefore, they can get lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests are realized at present with devices that look like a digital clock.
"Also, they will have the added advantage of which a possible aggressor perhaps does not identify the device."
"Or that should identify it after certain time, which can do that the police gain time," it adds.
Although the pursuit devices take in the doll or hanging, they will keep on using the same technology that is used for the vehicles pursuit.
It is a question of the cross-check of the position with a system GPS (that is used in the habitual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks as to surround the whole Czechia. But only they last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to light explosives.
Last year the Defense Department already added to his arsenal 224 kilometers of wick.
Therefore, they have stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the wick for explosives to the STV Group, to. century for forty million crowns.
The personnel of the General answered to MF DNES justifying the buy of such an enormous quantity of wick saying that the soldiers need for the formation maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnic ones of the army, with which MF DNES got in touch, it is decided nevertheless that, in such a case, there should realize the above mentioned maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all the generals, officials of high control, and even secretaries and cleaners.
There wanted exempt the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and not even the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
only this way it might justify that the army spends sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length is equivalent to 25.000 explosions.
Although this way out, the army would have stock sufficient for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial formation of every new professional it comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new buy (even adding the consumption of the engineers' units or special) stock sufficient for the 225 indicated previously.
The soldiers of the brigade of rapid intervention complained personally not long ago before the Minister Vondra because they say that scarcely they have ammunition for diverse weapon, for what the shot practices limit themselves even for money question.
And let's not speak on the absence of underwear.
"I do not manage to understand either that they buy to us repeatedly such wick quantities."
"But it is his decision and, undoubtedly, they will know why they act as like that."
"For us, the army is a good client whom, like company, we try to satisfy," admits the marketing manager of STV Group, Jan Děck ý.
The spokesman of the Defense Department Jan Pej ek defends the hundredth ones of kilometers of wick saying also that it will take stock of this "ammunition" as a minimum for ten years.
Nevertheless, Jan Děck ý, of STV Group, indicates that the wick just has a useful life of four years and, in case of the pyrotechnic products for the army or the two-year-old police officer.
"If it is stored in a few perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticism of the army, does not want to name.
After the ending of his useful life, every ammunition must be verified carefully to see if it keeps on being trustworthy and it will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and they need an additional investment.
Another argument of the Department is that, on having bought 445 kilometers of wick, it obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than the order of last 244 kilometers year," indicates spokesman Pej ek of the center of buys of the Defense Department.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of wick of the pyrotechnic ones of the police, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World war or the let for the Soviet army, already does not overcome for years 1.500 meters.
Also, the police always ask only for the just quantity as to exhaust the ammunition before his useful life is finished.
They decided it for safety reasons for the pyrotechnic ones and, also, meanwhile more modern and trustworthy types of wick can be obtained.
The Department already has clear difficulties to finish tens thousands of tons of ammunition of the epoch of the Agreement of Warsaw, when the Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand persons was preparing himself for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnic ones with which MF DNES spoke, after a pair of years the following problem will take place with the current one: it will be necessary to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is bought now "sale."
Till now I keep on living of the contacts that I obtained thanks to the contest
The fact of gaining the contest "Businessman of the year" helped Luká Pytloun in the sale of the exemption of his hotel.
The last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká gained the contest "Businessman of the year" Pytloun de Liberec.
His success history seems extracted of a movie.
Pytloun was loving traveling to Luká.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec it was necessary to have quality accommodation at good price.
With the savings that it assembled with seasonal works abroad and a credit of the bank he bought a house that was average in ruins composed of five apartments.
Bearing in mind that he was still studying his third year in the university, it was really brave.
"At present, the value for money of the accommodation in our area impelled me to do something on this matter," says Luká Pytloun.
It began renting the first apartment reconstructed to foreign workpeople.
All the income that it was obtaining was invested by him again in the building, which gradually it turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it managed to open little by little in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with an entire capacity of about 300 in all the accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, till not long ago, the hotel of design of four stars Pytloun.
Nevertheless, this year opened other of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our exemption concept, and other persons are showing interest in an exemption of Pytloun," said the businessman number one of last year.
"To this sale of licenses for the hotels opening it helped to a great extent the fact of gaining the contest of the 'Businessman of the year'," adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased his reputation and popularity both in Liberec and in the surroundings.
"The people were recognizing me as the street, they were still congratulating me often and, I must say, that it was very agreeable," he remembers.
Undoubtedly, he recommends to the whole world to want to try some company that takes part in the contest.
But he thinks that it is not necessary to win, but the participation is already beneficial.
He affirms that, until now, he keeps on living of the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, perhaps it had not obtained.
"With some persons that I met thanks to the contest I have usually begun collaborating."
The reputation associated with the success, in his opinion, included also in the personnel,
in whole about seventy.
"I have seen that show a major allegiance and are proud to take part in something that obtained the general recognition."
"It is not, not much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"Only that is my name the one that appears in the first page," says today modestly Luká Pytloun.
I wish my successor one calmer year than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria for the victory soon vanished for the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already spent the worst thing.
The proprietor of the company Farmet, Karel Ž ďársk ý, received the first award in the last edition of the contest of Vodafone "Company of the year," last year in the "Slavonic House" of Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which it managed to turn a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice in a signature with a business volume of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that not alone award cheered me up but to all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition," says the winner of last year.
The history of the company Farmet starts with the desire to make something useful.
That's why, when the State proposed to Karel's father Ž ďársk ý the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the properties sequestration during the communism, he did not doubt too much; he resigned from his position in the company in which worked and, with a pair of partners, they founded the company with his father of batteries of plastic.
Soon, they began specializing in presses of vegetable oil.
Eight years later they turned into the biggest manufacturer of automatic presses of the center of Europe.
They obtained a major presence also between not specializing public after reaching the success in the contest in the mass media.
"Not only our clients began considering to the mark Farmet as greatly better, but also the foreign associates began valuing the collaboration with a company that obtained a major success in his country," says Karel Ž ďársk ý.
Last year perhaps was not in alone Farmet a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
It obtained also recognition for the commercial results until the year 2008 and, partially, of 2009.
And exactly the year 2009 was the year more hardly for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not reached so many citizens yet, provoked that the companies it was stopping his investment projects and was beginning limiting the buy of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, do not escape from such a situation either."
"The income diminished in 40%, we had to limit the production and even had some dismissals," tells Karel Ž ďársk ý.
A viable company has to, sometimes, adopt even slightly popular measurements.
Nevertheless, they controlled the situation and supported the profit of the company, although it went at low levels to which before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses away it was in the research and development.
"With the subsidies we have constructed a research center and formation, reinforce the presence on the international market and we obtained magnificent evaluations in national fairs," he says Ž ďársk ý.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
The income increases again and, with them, the number of new personnel.
"The new achievement they hope that it should contribute a victory feeling, but in a more calmed ambience," points out Karel Ž ďársk ý.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous norms
The survey of Absurdity of the year is part for the fourth time of the managerial tournament.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey Absurdity of the year was the obligation to take to the administration documents to which the officials can gain access in line.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of the social security was asking for an extract of the mercantile record, although his officials can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of the social security already will not ask for an extract of the mercantile record when it realizes a control of the impositions of the policyholder," the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová declared.
The target of the survey Absurdity of the year consists of consulting the norms and regulation that the companies and businessmen must respect in Czechia and try that there are eliminated those that are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the managerial tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and the general public begins creating love also between.
While the edition of last year was provided with the participation of three thousand voters, this year practically reached the four thousand.
And it does not turn out surprising, a position that we still have different legal obligations in abundance that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of roles necessary for the tax return let's be first of all world," mentions Karel Havlíček of the Association of small and medium companies and of businessmen of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of the managerial norms is a declared target of all the governments.
Nevertheless, compared to the rest of the world, the progress situation especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Czechia places in the 74th position, that is to say, eight worse than positions last year.
The contest Absurdity of the year was celebrated for the first time in 2006 and every year recurs in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and ends of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be realized on the web page www.firmaroku.cz. Later, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antiaward" and, during October, it allows the public to vote in Internet across www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It gains the absurdity that receives more votes.
For the survey of this year more than hundred presented before themselves, in particular 105 norms and regulations that have no sense.
Both businessmen and professional associations and journalists sent the examples.
Between the "finalists" of the contest there was located, for example, the requisite of which the vehicles for the maintenance of the highways and freeways pay the toll or which the businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two baths paint every two years the walls.
The list of seventy proposals of this year is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which is always realized to beginnings of November in the square of Wenceslao of Prague, is part of an event in which there usually take part personalities of the political and social world.
This year, for example, there were present at this act of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium companies and of businessmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot support if the State puts him continuously you unite the businessmen, for it my target consists in of eliminating every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that at present complicate unnecessarily the commerce," announced the Minister of Industry and Martin Kocourek Traded.
The efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not remain in borages water.
In the year 2007, what more was bothering to the people was the obligation of the businessman to communicate with an advance of three days to the managerial office of the area of permanent functioning, the intention of coming with a position to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished secondly in number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the communication to the work office on the part of his foreign workpeople of the trips of work of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the called green card.
And the defeated one goes to the third one.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for the physiotherapists of having in his consultation a big mirror, an icebox and two scales of soil.
That's why, this year the Department of Health expressed a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have an icebox.
A new category recognizes the responsible companies socially
There are valued the ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
The innovation in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The assignment of this contest consists of endorsing the responsible and just companies.
"This way we want to support the companies that deal with the impact of his activity on the environment and that endorse socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and patroness of the contest, as in case of the contest of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of this year of the principal contest of Vodafone Empresa of the year 2010 companies appeared for which the commercial success is not the long-term only purpose.
The history of each of them turns out to be inspiring and he would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities changes completely between one and other one, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that they offer.
In a case, it is a question for example of the disabled persons, in others of the personal problems or of health of the personnel.
Between fourteen finalists of the whole Republic the company was located, for example, praguense of software Et Netera, which endorses the formation of informal sports teams between his workpeople, who later take part in tournaments of diverse sports.
Another example of company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Bravo, which already takes seven years being the principal funds contributor to sponsor the disabled children.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that worries especially about the problems of health of his workpeople, since it constitutes more than 70% of the staff; that's why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Czechia and in the contest Vodafone Empresa of the year it finished in the third place in the region.
In Olomouc it gained the company of accounting MiRyz Soft, which reduced the working, enclosed hours below the average of 35 weekly hours, without reducing the wages.
The title also they granted it to themselves because he buys primarily Czech manufacturers, it endorses the community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle the possible maximum thing so that our activities of production and administration produce the minor possible impact in the environment," tells the businesswoman Milu and Ryznarová.
YOUR responsible company Enlogit of the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of his personnel and, with every portable one, it offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; also, it endorses the work from house and in his managerial events it uses the services of catering of a local protected company.
"Also, we endorse the scholarship It presents itself in difficulty, that helps in particular the community romaní local," mentions the representative of the company Ondřej Such ý.
Also they are located in good place with a mention the company of laundry Praní to či tění of the region of Karlovy Vary, whose personnel receives bonuses of a special way that reverberate in his pension funds.
"We give benefits in meal, transport, progress of the qualifications and free time," says Josef Strapáč, of the company of construction of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year there were designated automatically all the regional finalists of the contest Vodafone Empresa of the year who answered to the questions of the entry and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers eliminated of the evaluation the forms that were not finished or erroneous.
"If the representatives of the companies candidates did not answer the questions, they could not take part in the contest of Company responsible for the year, but they do not remain discredited of the "principal" contest Vodafone Empresa of the year."
"The individual candidacies for this contest are not allowed, since it is a question of a subcategory of the principal contest of Company of the year," tells Karel Goldman of the consultancy They biare and Rose.
The police realized arrests during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Fund, in Pilsen
The police against the corruption realized diverse arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
The detectives handcuffed a local businessman of the sector of the means and the real estate businessman Lubo G.
As it seems, this one tried to manipulate a current public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that a precise interested party was receiving the auctioned area.
He had to pay for it to Lubo G. half a million crowns.
"For the time being I can only say that the police look for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender," said to Právo the chief of the general district attorney of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being it cannot spread any more details of the current investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On the way in which it could influence the public auction, considering little official information, it is possible only to speculate.
The spokeswoman of the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černá answered to the Právo questions saying that the police carried out really the arrest in the Pilsen head office and were during a public auction.
"It is a question of a client, not of one of our workpeople," he added.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for the presentation of proposals of transference of areas in accordance with the law on the ground" and is realized when there appear several parts interested as regards the offered area.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value superior to that of his restitution, which must be transferred before he announces the value of the area to himself."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers decides and, later, the Agricultural Fund transfers the area to the person who offers the biggest offer" the spokeswoman of the Fund explained.
Lubo G. had information about who was going to present before himself to the call and, since simultaneously she is an interested person because he acquired diverse restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties in the area that would not take part in the auction.
For such a favor, he was receiving a commission.
This would explain that, at the moment of the arrest, it should have so much money above.
Lubo G. had special contacts at the bottom of Pilsen already for time.
It was appearing in the cause of the ancient chief of the PF Václav Sankot, which was accused for finishing the areas replacement for which a decision of construction had already been expressed.
For example, Lubo G. has just obtained of the Fund a few areas foreseen for the construction of public infrastructures, in particular in the place where it would be necessary to construct a big highway to the Borská pole industrial area.
Later, it changed them of very beneficial form with the magistrate into a house into the proper historical center of the city with a very top value.
In this case, the town hall had to intervene because, in the opposite case, the blocked areas would avoid the construction.
The families will have to pay a few additional expenses of several hundreds of crowns a month
The hearths will have to pay from not alone January for all the types of energy, but also for water and electricity, complements for heating and, in some cases, major rents.
Consequently, the families will have to extract of the portfolio, from January, several hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The price of the electricity increases in 4,6%, the gas about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to more 10% for the water supply and many increase also the price of the central heating.
The increase of the electricity for the families that live in apartments should promote to approximately 100 crowns more a year that now.
Nevertheless, the principal electricity providers reduced the prices, because there is increasing the support to the production of energy of renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaic one.
Nevertheless, the gas gets dearer moderately, especially at the moment when more the heating is used and, therefore, major is the consumption.
In this case, also they must be provided with a pair of hundreds of crowns more a year.
While the electricity and the gas get dearer throughout the country, the change of price of the central heating changes back and forth.
The prices increase plans principally the biggest municipality.
For example, the hearths of Pardubice or of Hradec Králové will pay from January for the central heating approximately 50 crowns more a month, while the Liberec families will pay more than 1.000 additional crowns a year.
The residents in Prague also will have to support an increase of 9% of the price of the water and the heating, especially in case the city increases the rent of the infrastructures.
If the rent does not change, the praguenses will pay 6,8% additional.
The prices in Prague, nevertheless, will keep on being between the lowest of the whole country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are between the highest, both valuations will get dearer 7,4%.
They can increase greatly the prices of the rent of 450.000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will finish in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which possesses in Ústí nad Labem about 2.500 apartments, will increase the rent from January in up to 100%.
The company will take the courts to those who do not agree with the new rent.
The regular rents, which they benefit to the residents of about 300.000 apartments, might increase the next year up to 10%.
The Czech young people gets drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is already not of way, because it does effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen from his parents.
These are the drinks that they provoke that drinkers finish in young medical care with an age lower than fifteen years.
The children who finish knocked down in the hospital continuously to overcome the surf are already not an exception.
This stems from the experience of the doctors who meet such cases in the admissions of paediatrics of the hospital.
"To drink beer or wine is already not fashionable, because they are late very much in making drunk them."
"Now the strong alcoholic beverages are the fashion," indicates to Právo the chief of paediatrics of the Hospital Hořovice in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they manage to take a bottle to his father of the larder, it can be a whisky, but normally it is a question of Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of which it gets lighter with juice and of which it does not smell so much," he tells.
It is confirmed also by the spokeswoman of the university Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it usually talks each other of Fernet or rum."
"These are the modern alcoholic beverages, in particular between the students."
"In some cases, they use firewater that they took at home," adds Jurinová.
According to the chief Pelikán, they are thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers those who occur rarely they appear in the hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where it works from this year, it was employed during a decade at the paediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances were taking the young people from the nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter perhaps four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3,5 of alcohol in blood, in addition to a miscellany with delight," indicates the doctor of the department on this case.
"It was in the Hole fair ovice in some dance holiday."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not even surprised that his daughter was disappearing 48 hours," the chief is surprised.
It is precisely the absence of interest of the parents or enclosed his clear tolerance towards the drink on the part of his children the one that is considered to be the principal cause of the increase of the consumption of alcohol between the young people.
The experts point out that, in case of the children, it is not possible to speak properly about dependency.
"There is understood by alcoholic a person who has a chronic dependency on the alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with the same one, which does not take place in children."
"In those that drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it owes of a social or familiar environment systematically frustrated," tells the chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric Motol clinic forty intoxicated children were hospitalized until middle of November.
Nevertheless, the statistics only show those who come with a serious poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
The young drinkers who, after the ambulant medical recognition, go away to house with the parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which the children simply meet after the school and firewater is drunk, for Pelikán there exist three seasonal ups and downs that it is necessary to mention: the day of witches, Fin de Año and the end of the school course.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"In the day of the witches I have gone so far as to see in admissions up to seven intoxicated children simultaneously," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who happen the night in detoxification under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage of which on the following day they do not suffer a terrible surf at home.
The morning headache provoked by the dehydration and the absence of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a whey with glucose and with the nutrients that the organism lacks.
"These take it much better, because after the rough night, they get up good and it does not hurt them at all."
"Only they prove to be confused with regard to where they are," points out Pelikán, adding that, often, the patients lose the good humor at least when they see the expenses that they have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospitalization in a room for serious patients goes so far as to cost a ten thousands of crowns.
"Often I have used the cost as a way of educating them, when in the visit I say them straight to the children how much has cost his inebriation and that would have to spend the whole summer in a work for young people so that you were gaining the sufficient thing to be paid this night," adds Pelikán.
The medical insurance, in his opinion perhaps like regressive measurement, which usually returns to the persons the expenses of the treatment, does not do it in case of children who drink.
Two planes L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two planes L-159 of a whole of five, with which the Czech Defense Department replaced the plane He Marries C-295M, they departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the airships finds House - EADS.
It is the first time that a device of this type is in hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to realize flights of practices or of demonstration.
It is a question of the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now the Czech army was using and which was still in the state of flying.
Three remaining planes are the single-seater L-159.
These still survive in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, he already took their charge last week.
Jan Peje k, of the department of press of defense, indicates that it is not known yet when the planes will move back physically from Vodochody.
"The planes single-seater L-159, on the other hand, were separated from the planes repaired some time ago, without investments or additional contributions on the part of the Department."
"Them two-seater L-159T1 they were exchanged in his current state," he said to Právo Pej ek.
He added that the army does not remain without planes two-seater, since in May, 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a quantity of 200 million crowns for the construction of four devices L-159 unnecessary for two-seater.
One of the new planes the army already received it in July, other will surrender at the end of year.
According to Pej ek, EADS committed himself to which the planes are added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the contract it is indicated clearly that the company EADS is the one that withdraws the planes L-159 and that will serve for the pilots' practices of countries of the NATO."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how it is going to use them in this frame," points out Pej ek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a plane Marries and the buy of another three airships for 3.500 million crowns they were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Department did not summon a tender for the buy and negotiated straight with EADS.
The current defense direction affirms that the exchange promotes the future exportation of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired to Aer 72 airships and only it uses 24, therefore he wants to sell the rest.
The planes buy House possibly goes so far as to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission already denounced the Czech Defense Department before the European Court of Justice because he should choose the planes realizing an European tender and without getting in touch with the only manufacturer.
The army already received three planes He marries and the last one should come to the airport praguense from Kbely in fourteen days.
An index finger longer that the ring finger indicates a lower risk of suffering cancer
The men who have the longest index that the ring finger they are subject to a minor risk of suffering prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of one he studied published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It might they depend on the level of testosterone, the masculine hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can constitute a simple proof of the risk of suffering prostate cancer, in particular for the men with ages of up to 60 years," indicated the coauthor of the study Ros Eeles, teacher of the Institute for the investigation on the cancer in the University of Warwick.
Consequently, the finger might help to determine what men should be put to a test of cancer of prostate, in particular if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, like familiar problems of health, as Indian Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, it realized the pursuit with a British counterpart of more than 1.500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, of 3.000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger Indian of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were presenting the same probabilities of suffering prostate cancer that 19% of those which fingers were of the same length.
In case of the men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was diminishing in 33%; for the men with ages lower than 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relation between the length of two fingers in question determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exhibited in the counterfoil.
A level of low testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that the testosterone influences the development of the cancer of prostate.
The big Czech geneticist and ancient president of the Academy of Sciences, the teacher Václav Pačes, said to ČTK that it knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relation between the length of the fingers and the cancer could "be demonstrated completely."
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and the D5 are closed
Czechia, as most of Europe, it dawned on Thursday snow covering.
The highways and sidewalks are covered principally by compact snow and the machines snowplough circulated the whole night along numerous areas.
In the morning there was closed the highway D5 between the kilometers 89 and 93 in direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourisms, as the D1 in Brno in direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the kilometer 91 damaged a truck, in 93 they shocked two industrial vehicles that injured men provoked.
Also several tourisms finished in the ditch.
Problems exist also in the divided highway D1 in the kilometer 185 in direction of Prague.
There they shocked two trucks.
The drivers must circulate slowly after Brno in the kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join in the kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
There cloggings of several kilometers have formed.
Also an accident has taken place in the highway D11, I joust along with Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate-7 ºC.
Cloggings are forming for example in Prosek, although also it is congested Š těrboholská.
The surest transport way is the meter.
The tramcars circulate late, for example in the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another crisis state will take place in Prague.
The problems affect also to the railroads and to the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railroad company should have annulled seven connections for rapid three.
The problems affect, for example, to the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
The travelers should verify what the current situation is.
The airport Ruzyn ě closed from eleven o'clock on Wednesday night until five o'clock in the morning.
At present, already it is possible to circulate along most of the highways of the south of Moravia, but with extreme precaution.
In Vy kovska three back roads are closed to the circulation, in Brněnska snow languages are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to gain access to certain routes of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy kovsko.
Until now the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Š aratice - mile ovice.
To clear them milling machines will be needed.
For the time being it is not possible to say when they will open to the circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is needed in the area of Bílé Karpaty (white Carpathians).
The highways of the region that, since it is a question of a protected natural area, have to be left simply in the inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as Indian ČTK.
In Czechia they fell down between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell down.
The snowfalls send gradually in Czechia.
The American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known for the time being only for the codified name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle should influence the local conflict with the talibans and that "it should change the progress of the game" it was doing his victory.
The new weapon is like a small gun and with an extremely precise aim.
His bullets go off with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that it contains provokes that in fact I worked like a small grenade.
The bullets can be programmed so that they exploit not only when they beat to the target, but in any point that is in his ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against the enemies who hide after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, it is not possible to use a normal protection and, when it throws his killer rain of metallic matchwood, it can turn out to be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke on the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry that uses an "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, they aim to the same at his laser, which determines the distance, later it obtains a precise point of view and, according to the same one, he corrects the projection line and presses the trigger."
"Let's say that 543 meters have measured themselves."
"When the trigger is touched, the weapon is loaded and throws the bullet at a 543 meters distance, more less one, two or three meters," points out Audette.
400 jobs move
The consortium Fujitsu moves his division in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change his place of work of his previous office block into Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves his division in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As there communicated the giant of the sector specializing in computers and his maintenance on Wednesday, the 400th men and women will move in July of the following year of his previous office block in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park, a big office complex in the street Lyoner Straße in the quarter of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu told that in the mid term another 100 employees more of the consortium, which previously they were spread by the region, will lodge there.
The offer is highly attractive, also the collective office in Star Park will favor the way of working of the personnel.
Also, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner affirmed, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central emplacement with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important at present for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region provoked yesterday happiness between those who were in favor and disappointment between those who were against.
The chief of section of economy of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) affirmed that with that a "Global Player" has been gained.
This is a "magnificent recognition to the emplacement."
Fujitsu settles in the city, the establishment is a big impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The green ones) complains about the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction informed earlier the city about his intention.
"Naturally we have offered to the company our help," he declared Korwisi.
Nevertheless, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the proprietor of the property in Marienbader Platz could not have changed in the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives producieron the fall.
Of such a way, now there is a big empty place to be covered in the famous position.
"I hope that the owner and the lessor of the building should prove to be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" they were part with the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial spa project of construction of the city.
As joint project of the city and of a project private enterprise between the station and the town hall forms a new entry to the city, which takes charge of the criticism as for the massive building that previously was using the hollows as parking squares and as for the level of the buildings.
In 2001 Start Amadeus has installed to themselves the commission of investment and companies of appraisal, the Software manufacturer for reservations systems, as well as then Siemens joined with the house manufacturer of computers Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real you Be and one year later resold to the Spaniard Falcon Real you Be Investments SA in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, native to Tokyo, is recognized like YOUR biggest third world provider.
He has companies, for example computers and servants, and gives also the precise services.
The division in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the biggest in Germany, anyhow Fujitsu is provided with more business in Munich.
The branch Fujitsu Technology Solutions settles from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branches in this place will be a Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That's why 7.000 square meters have been rented in the office block of Star Park.
The ancient complex of the twenties, his name alludes to his plane with form of star, lodges between others the central association of electrotécnica and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the servant - You threaten against Assange
The anxiety takes possession increasingly of Wikileaks.
The provider of Internet services Amazon has eliminated the platform of revelations of his servant.
Possibly behind political pressure is after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, apparently is detained in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the target of the criticism, always stronger in the United States.
The Internet activists lost the access to his previous American servant and at present they look for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who finds in the list of persons searches of Interpol, must remain arrested in Great Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expulsada del servidor de Amazonas."
"To speak freely in the country of the freedom," were communicating the activists of the revelations by means of the service of courier service Twitter Wednesday (local time).
Little earlier, the company of Internet, Amazon, had eliminated the documents of Wikileaks of his servant.
The Internet activists had resorted in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the web of services Amazon to be able to face to the high numbers of access to the documents.
By means of Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following thing: "Perfect, we will destine our dollars to hire the people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with the freedom of expression, "they should allow selling books."
Amazon detained the use of his servant by means of Wikileaks, after an employee of senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, informed the chain CNN as a call to the office of Lieberman.
The presidency of the council of the senate for the safety of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guard."
"He had wished Amazon to take these measures earlier, before the previous publications of information classified by means of Wikileaks," the senator declared.
Lieberman also was requesting that the platform also was prohibiting in other countries the use of the servant.
"The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate Wikileaks process puts in game our national safety and threatens the life in the world," he steadied himself in a bulletin of the independent senator.
"No responsible company, already be American or foreign, it must help Wikileaks with his service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is looked in Sweden by violation suspicion, finds in the list of persons searches of Interpol.
According to an article about the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is stopped in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has qualified constantly the investigation in Sweden like a plot of his enemy.
The spokeswoman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, affirmed in London that they have existed you threaten.
"There were even called ones on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he is afraid for the Assange safety, affirmed Hrafnsson.
Therefore, it continues without revealing to him the location of the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to the declarations of North America.
In America, the previous republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, affirmed that the person in charge of the revelations of Wikileaks must be judged for treachery and must be executed.
In Canada, affirmed an adviser of the chief of government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange should "be murdered" and Obama might "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange grows a big dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American president Barack Obama, qualified of "ridiculously and absurdly" that Assange has asked for the resignation of the secretary of the state, in case she should be a person in charge of ordering recently diplomats to interfere in spying tasks.
"I am not completely sure why it must import the opinion of a type for us with a web page," Gibbs declared.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than his web page."
The American government has to demonstrate the efficacy of the protection of his databases of a general way.
Russell Travers, distribution assistant manager of the National Center against the terrorism, was nominated an exceptional manager, he announced the White House.
Therefore Travers is a person in charge of developing "the important structural reforms," which are necessary in view of the Wikileaks filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the ways, as well as change the entire information about the government and protect it.
Also, the American government announced that to take charge of the safety of the dissidents and activists, they must put in danger the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done all the possible to get in touch with them," affirmed the spokesman of the Department of the State, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help to protect them if it was necessary."
The university of the ice cream
In "Gelato University" in Bologna ice-cream sellers prepare themselves in the best seasons.
The basic course of three days for future ice-cream sellers has the maximum inflow and visitors of the whole world.
In fact where from does the whole ice cream come?
Of the gelatiere and of the gelataio.
The gelatiere prepares the cream as all the rules of the Italian art of the making of ice creams.
The gelataio extracts with a spatula the cream of the ice cream of the counter, extends it on the wafer and sells it.
To know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But the one who wants to know more on ice creams, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of the ice cream with the freezer in the year 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of his machines fulfills the Italian ideal high places everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future ice-cream sellers has the maximum inflow and visitors of the whole world.
Also there are more special courses of more days on the chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice-cream parlor of the proper house.
In these crisis times, some of them dream of a new career, others risk in the soft ice cream his vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants of 19 countries of all the continents, from Brazil up to Saudi Arabia happening for Hungary.
Jacky, teacher of this art of California, him loves the slow movement of the meal and in the future he wants to offer an European quality product in the ground of the industrial ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is a companies assessor and he wants to create something proper in some years inside a work enervante.
Two Egyptian young people dreams of opening an ice-cream parlor in the Cairo.
A man of Malta and other of Brazil they want to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because his children love the Italian ice creams.
The main ice-cream seller Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
His good taste is not decisive alone, but also his silky gentleness and his good consistency.
Luciano forgets neither his formation nor the covering of cream of the national top house and principally of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has anything romantic."
The first step to the making seems the easiest.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a big mixer, which warms everything with an electronic program up to 85 grades and to the moment it cools it up to four grades.
Then it opens the faucet of the machine and goes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all the types of ice creams of milk.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can the ice cream cream be prepared only with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How is it possible to give free rein to any desire of experimenting?
Luciano advises to get confused of the tendencies of the epoch.
The one that speaks about ice cream "not only of natural ingredients," perhaps has used stabilizers, principally a natural product, probably gum guar, of bean guar.
Surely it is possible to prepare ice cream without stabilizer, it is necessary only to buy it one day, it to place in a bag and the client morderá a sonorous granite ice cream.
Certain changes are allowed in the basic mass.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, the teacher Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients those that are bought in the fruit section or in that of sweets of the supermarket.
Also, there are dust and pastas.
"All the providers will try to strain ingredients scented in his goods."
"Nevertheless they must experiment one day."
Be already with fruit sherbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will turn a yellow cream and with cocoa in dust like base for all the possible pleasures of the chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the ice-cream makers.
Luciano allows them to prepare every time four types different from ice cream of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They realize the same experiment also with types of ice cream of fruit.
That knows better does not depend necessary on that has more aroma of tofe or any more purée of fruits.
It is not necessary that the hazelnuts ice cream knows to dry fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The group of work prepares the adorable ice cream of kiwi, which uses more fruits, less water and slightly less of stabilizer.
First a balanced miscellany highlights the flavor of the ice cream, affirms Luciano.
The ice creams making is a problem of artimética: The peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, it is necessary to reduce the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe.
For the lemon ice cream it is necessary to have an extra sugar portion.
Luciano extracts a tool with which it fixes the quantity of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the vinicultor for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the stage facilitates the account.
To prepare ice cream needs only the physical application, as earlier.
Not only it helps the tool for the automatic making of the basic mass.
Also there is a tool, in which the prepared ice cream miscellany is beaten simultaneously and cools down to temperature under zero.
In spite of everything, the whole automation remains out as for the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo gets dirty himself himself and his partners of above to below with fruits purée, as if one was the minifirst giant without control.
"In all the courses," affirms the teacher Luciano, "there is alone a question of time that spends something like that."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European authority of safety of the food Efsa has infiltrated into the industry that experiments with plants transgénicas.
At present this matter formulates the group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered to be an institute for the evaluation independent from the impact of the biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," affirmed Christoph Then, the director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts of Efsa on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert also they are hired for years in the association Ilsi.
The consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer finance it.
Kuiper has collaborated in a significant way in the norms of cross-check of Efsa of genetically modified plants, what it places to him in a clear interests conflict, criticizes Then.
The Efsa dispositions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the papers of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which in fact is controlled by his Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interests collision.
This way, not long ago, a manager of high status of Efsa went without the support or the time of transition to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and it has changed with that his edict.
Not long ago, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the examination of the EU and the industry, which there realized Oficinal General of the Environment as well as a parliamentary clairvoyant of the EU.
Nevertheless, Efsa cannot recognize any interests conflict.
One resorts to all the formal information, also to some of the industry, whenever they are of a high and technical quality, they are ordained in a report.
There are not demanded the experts who are employed at Efsa that do not have any contact with the industry.
But they must exhibit these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
Is named himself as a neutral forum for the experts and the science, the industry and the politics, between others for the evaluation of the risk for the biotechnology without the Lobby order.
In this topic, independent experts, like Then, criticize that at present plants are allowed transgénicas without investigating the meal for the animals and that does not verify the influence of the plants genetically modified in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, does the corn genetically modified in the agriculture," affirms Then.
The current practice consists of verifying just isolated proteins, but it does not plant it transgénica informs, which does not offer trustworthy results.
"If they do not look for the risks: how are they going to be?," he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck opina de la misma manera.
The scientist investigates from 1994 the field of the genetic engineering and at present it is employed at the Technical Institute of Zurick.
In this ambience, the industry tries, in the USA and in Europe, to influence increasingly or discredit the critical scientists.
That's why, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For the companies, the critical studies are not usually published.
"The industry controls the investigation of the safety," supports Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has obtained someone, in whole approximately 400 kilos.
On Monday it was before the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba to the backs.
There were declarations
It was snowing.
The history is well-known: In September the excavators came and they began to knock down a big piece of the north wing.
The ground of Stuttgart never was the same again: Thousands and thousands were evident against s21, the millions suspension at the station.
Since it was sealed, most of the wing hizó debris.
It rotates in 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
He has insured himself a pair of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
One fills with enthusiasm: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he said once, the smoke of the cigarets has smelled.
He does not know yet what will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The track of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous deposit of ammunitions of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man treats with ancient stones.
He has bought everything what results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the grit or would send it to the garbage collector," he affirms in his office, a wooden small house that once was a guard hut.
They insulted him and threatened, he tells, when, in September, it appeared in the newspapers, which he had bought the remains of the north wing to the company of demolitions.
The habló with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he told to them that it could not do absolutely anything for the demolition.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones kept on being used.
Approximately 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilos cut mazizo, with a price for piece from 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some of them took it as a memory but also with the hope to be able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
Approximately the half is still in the forest, the rest some time ago that sold.
Gardens proprietor, gardener landscape painter taken charge of projects.
They came from all parts and took what they could take in the porter and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse some time ago that has turned into "the wall" or into the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact this stone is not special at all," affirms Rongen.
"If it was not for the political component."
It promotes his todoterreno, does a tour for his 20 hectares big kingdom.
He studied right, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in the computers and finally it works with stones.
And it is lover of the stones.
It lodges to 4.000 tons of stone.
It transports his treasures for the whole Germany.
He says to be the biggest dealer of ancient stones of the country.
It brakes.
In the snow there are artistic cut sandstone stones.
"Pertencieron to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he tells.
White, yellow, warm limestone, he gets enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The way crosses the forest.
It indicates a heap: Red sandstone, a previous piece of the station of Kaslsruhe.
And it continues.
"Nice travertino."
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Throughout in the snow, stones and histories, travertino yellow of the police headquaters of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, tufa of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what perspiration.
When Rongen thinks about as it sculpted earlier the stones and moved them with a simple tackle and a wagon, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
It has not become rich, by no means immensely richly.
But today 14 persons gave that to make the stone dealer, also stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glazier and a gardener have settled above in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," affirms the man who is in charge of making use of the remains.
Soon it has to go to Cologne.
There also there are stones to be rescued.
Talents struggle about big potentials
An active inflow reigns in the buffet.
16 students crowd about the buns, the soup of tomato and the sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of cars Vokswagen they have invited to a workshop the students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a species of contest of ideas, they have to speak on the car of the future with the VW workpeople and also learn everything on Volkswagen.
Competing and of the same way, many companies, like VW, assemble in a struggle body to body about the minds most privileged in collaborations with the universities.
His mission: To hire as soon as possible the pupils with more talent of the universities, before they enter on the labor market and are hired by others.
And as the universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of his students, it tries to be watched to the exceptional talents in practical projects and to receive them.
The second day of project in the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium is gained to the talents.
Miss of the personnel department distributes pens, rubber bands and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to expectant young talents the programs of practices and the works for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig takes the project with VW.
It sees advantages for both parts: "The students contact the industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can meet the students, observe more closely the interesting candidates and consider them to be possible hard-working futures."
Some collaborations, he says That It should Seal, they are not slightly common.
The innovation is in that the students are wished so straight.
"The principal point previously was in the technical projects," he affirms Seal.
The struggle for the fresh postgraduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, the companies cannot already choose his personnel between a big group of petitioners.
If not that have to promise to be and, especially, to obtain a highly qualified labor.
All the students of the disciplines of engineering are in an excellent negotiation situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for his initials in German), in October 40.000 positions of vacant engineers existed.
And, according to the predictions of the VDI, this engineers' gap will grow moreover.
In the company of audit and advice, KPMG, Roman Dykta takes charge of the hunting for talents.
He organizes costly hiring events, like the career KPMG, a type of modern yincana, in which the participants have to find his way by means of coordinated of the GPS.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the USA the following year.
Also the participants can observe the KPMG branches and learn on the company.
Is decided who must go in two election rounds in the exit.
Only I cremated it of I cremated of many participants it goes to the USA.
The universities strain increasingly in choosing and polishing to the potential high places of the universities, according to Dykta.
"With the career we want to stand out of the mass."
"Himself we had left the simple trajectory short."
For the headhunter Dykta the notes give results.
"Up to today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some of them are close to his end, and want to request to work with us," he affirms.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, also there are in the hunting, especially, the small and medium, classic enterprises with his fairs of the work.
"We try to obtain students in the specializing fairs."
"A little on Interlot," affirms Sitha Stübe in charge of personnel for the manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld.
The company Bonner has approximately 1.500 personnel in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
At present on the web page of the company 35 vacant positions appear.
"It is very complicated to refill the vacant positions."
"Slope a lot of time and money," he affirms.
A shorter way is the contact with the teachers of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher institutes of learning, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that practices can be done with us or realize his thesis.
Expensive advertizing campaigns are not realized for the solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to improve itself with other advantages: Personal ambience, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A big consortium normally cannot offer it," there declares Stübe, the manager of personnel.
In the search of an employment, the money is already not the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible schedules of work, assistance to children or good possibilities of ascent.
According to a study of Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld shows the square 55 between the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute prepares an annual list of the best German providers of employment.
For what he asks the employee about the satisfied thing that is with the work and with the ambience in the same one and observes the conditions previous to the personnel.
Stübe, the personnel manager also waits for points extra in his classification for his applicants to work.
"I believe that the petitioner concentrates especially on the external classifications of a potential employer," he affirms.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler de la Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises to the companies to want a long-term strategy that a good reputation as employers is gained.
He advises to his clients more authenticity.
And it means that, according to Kriegler, especially, internal measurements.
"The best way to become attractive like employer passes for the proper personnel," he makes sure.
In the slang of the sector his name is internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity inside the proper staff.
"A few satisfied personnel is the best ambassadors."
When one treats well the people and they identify it with the company, then promotion is obtained straight for the employer on the part of friends and acquaintances.
"It is like a game with band," affirms Kriegler.
Obama detains new petroleum perforations
From the coast of the American state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new petroleum perforation has appeared in these years.
The government of Washington expressed a forceful prohibition and with it it annulled his previous plans of an inappealable way.
Also before the Atlantic coast new perforations remain forbidden for the time being.
This there announced the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What provoked this strict prohibition, which at least will be current the following five years, is the explosion of the oil rig "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the life to eleven workers and provoked the biggest environmental catastrophe of the USA, the president Barack Obama had admitted new perforations into the part west of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure of the opposition and of the industry.
The followers wanted to diminish this way the dependency on the USA of new provisions of oil of the foreigner.
Up to today it has not cleared up completely of whom it is the responsibility of the irreparable black tide in the gulf.
In the center of the criticism there is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced by million demands.
A commission of investigation entrusted by Obama will present his results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Secretary of the Interior, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Later, different consortiums peteroleros presented requests for new attempts of perforation.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe using a few harder control panel and a few more strict safety regulations.
At present the authority of responsible control, which after having being accused of corruption charges has fallen down in discredit, reforms of root.
Obama announces in a parallel way that the lucrative fiscal lagoons will close for the consortiums of the oil and of the gas.
The industry announces publicly that the entire extraction in the gulf will be minor thanks to a more strict regulation, up to the date.
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the industries of the oil and of the gas," says the result of the current opinion poll realized by the company assessor BDO - before the Wednesday extraction prohibition.
American Energey Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
The investments in new projects of extraction extend for the prompt thing, to the detriment of the growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is márrón oil, it smells like a petrol station: Million spilled liters of crude oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogonilandia.
The people live of the theft, the corruption and the illegal commerce of oil.
Celestine Akpobari likes.
"Do not get tired," the environmental activist calm the journalists: "Today enough oil will happen before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water up to the breast with the sheen of the lights reflected in turbulencies in the surface: With the coloring sheen of the water, the scene seems almost nice.
It is not seen that on the surface brown oil spots float.
Earlier here it was taking scampi to fistfuls, tells Esther Badom in the shore of the river Bodo-Jetty.
While, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive oil quantity was spilled in the formidable wetland by broken tubes.
The fish of the surroundings of the small city of Bodo had to swim six hours to come to fish high tide: That, in the heart of the delta of the Niger and placed in Ogonilandia, is considered to be one of the most infected with the plague regions of the world.
In the way of the trip of the river that happens for swamps, the extensive desolation turns out to be obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the ship removes a brown broth, who immerses his hand in the water, it will extract a few oil full houses.
The roots of the trees of the swamps rise from the soil like dark liquorice sticks, sadly they isolate the palm trees that shock and hang his palms.
In vain they look for flocks, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as one keeps silent about the barrier of the exterior, there expands in her a species of ghostly calmness of a previous paradise with smell of petrol station.
"What here happens is an ecological struggle," affirms, unsociable, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for the health."
The warlike comparison proceeds.
The area of the establishment of the ogoni is toughly battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers popped in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the consortium had to place his first factory Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the personnel of the oil.
Nowadays the return of the companies is still prohibited to Ogonilandia: While they were pumping every day more than two million barrels of black gold of the whole region of the delta, of a size three times major than Switzerland, with more than 5.000 sources of extraction and 7.000 kilometers of tubes, the oil-bearing fields in Ogonilandia were calm, the place is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters were standing out platforms of steel as slovenly sculptures of the water: "Arbolitos of Christmas" called affectionately the heads of the drills.
They have up to 50 years, the majority they present an entire corrosion.
All the time it trumps a compress, thinks Akpobari, spring of that time a constant oil jet in the water.
According to the evaluations of the experts, more than two billion liters have been spilled in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the oil quantity penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the biggest catastrophes ecólogicas of the history of the humanity.
The one who is responsible for the lasting environmental region, will fight with it.
While the consortium of Shell and the organized thefts of oil are responsible for more than 90 per cent of the contamination, the ecologists see to the compresses on the verge of breaking and to the tubes with escapes like the principal causers.
In Nigeria, Shell applies principally standard safety shallows normally in the world the conventional ones, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached to the consortium in 2008: Only the indexes of defects of the tubes are "on a multiple one major than in another place."
In a place, which from a distance seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures arise of between the swamps: They are naked and oil silverware.
Between one of many barrels, which sometimes are joined to the perforations, sometimes interspersed arbitrarily on the area, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil warms up in the fire more hours, tells Michael, the chief of the group.
First of all, the gasoline penetrates by means of the tubes in the receptacle, later the oil tubes drip and finalemente it goes out diésel.
This way, Michael and four employees produce every day up to four barrels of 300 liters diésel: "It brings us 34.000 naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta make use of the fuel scarcity in one of the biggest oil-bearing states of the Black Africa.
Nigeria only is provided with the only refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of the diesel of scarcely 40 euros - cents for liter the illegal heaters can offer even less: This way they reduce the value of his raw material.
It comes from "those of the bunkers," which trucaron the network of tubes that Ogonilandia crosses: According to the experts, to this step 16 lose at least millions of liters of oil a day in everything the delta of the Niger.
Only an insignificant part of the material stored provisional premium is refined clearly of illegal form: The organized criminal networks, to which also political and high military charges belong, keep the best part in cisterns and it sell bargain sale on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely the debate to be academic if the environmental catastrophe owes rather to the handling of the population or to the slack way of production.
"If the oil companies will not behave like invaders and they had not destroyed completely the natural habitat of the fish, there would be neither sabotage, nor thefts, nor illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed especially by Shell up to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the small stone."
Michael becomes nervous.
"It is already being time for you to disappear," says the muscular one Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes to the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers proceeding from the north also want, all the Nigerians, to extract like profit of the raw material.
"This convicted invention has done pieces completely to our country," affirms Akpobari.
The investigators detect dangerous factory defects in the engines of the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a big problem of safety.
In an investigation of a machine that realized a forced landing, the investigators found a possible defect of factory, which it can produce "a catastrophic mistake in the engine."
The airline Qantas wants to demand the manufacturer of the engine.
The passengers of the Airbus of Qantas that realized an emergency landing at the beginning of November very were lucky that the one that can imagine: The authorities of air safety Australians perceived thanks to his investigations a big problem of safety in the engines of some A380, and they are alert of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated aftereffects: In a muffs connection, fissures can be caused by fatigue or cracks, announced the authorities of the ATSB in a report published Thursday.
This might have caused "a catastrophic mistake in the engine."
This affected to the engines made by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 planes of the series A380.
Between that there is the Qantas-Airbus that had to realize a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal averages against the British turbines manufacturer.
It presented a demand in the federal court of Sidney who was making more juridical measurements possible against the company.
Alan Joyce, the director of Qantas, declared that his airline will claim an indemnification for the incident of beginning of November.
In the mark of the engine they have lost pieces and his wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of the gasoline as the cause of the damages.
After the incident, up to 40 engines of the whole world they have to be stores.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry more safety tests out to the superjumbos provided with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, affirmed Martin Dolan, spokesman of ATSB.
The safety problem has turned into the sufficiently important thing as to inform all the affected ones.
After the emergency landing of the device of Qantas, the airline supported to his fleet A380 in ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines supported approximately three of his eleven A380 temporarily in ground.
Lufthansa restored the engine of an A380 as measurement of precaution.
This plane with double covering is the biggest plane of passengers of the world.
A Nevada in the whole country provokes the chaos in the traffic
Completely white Germany: Of one day for other it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets the chaos reigns, they trump the trains and the planes.
At least three persons have lost the life in traffic accidents.
The winter it freezes Germany: In almost the whole country icy temperatures were reached during the Thursday night, what has unleashed the chaos in the traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and of this one, there is a layer of snow of 15 centimeters of thickness.
The traffic is much limited in most of freeways and in many streets.
In the A7 at a height of Flensburg, the snowploughs are in continuous functioning, removing the new snow repeatedly, but it is not prepared.
Also, strong wind gusts sweep the coast of the Baltic sea.
The Marine and Hydrographic Federal Agency of Germany (BSH) waits for living tides with the water level 1,2 meters over his habitual level on the beach of the Baltic sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the snow accumulation caused considerable problems in the freeways and in the state highways.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is summoned in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold winds and fortresses her are in charge of swirling.
There many trucks and cars remained caught during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities notified important disorders in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed the traffic and created cloggings.
In Thuringia the snowfalls affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, they wait for big disorders in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
The snow in the highway, the trees fallen down on the rails or the ruined overhead power cable and the holes are the principal problems.
En Sajonia se suspende servicio el-interurbano de Leipzig un Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Thuringia a train HOISTS it had to stop his trip to Munich.
The firemen and the service of rescue attended to 165 passengers in the train with blankets of wool, meal and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
In the biggest German airport, the winds with snow provoked numerous flights suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman of the head office of information of flights, in Munich they have already announced some cancellations to themselves.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman of Fraport there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The snowploughs are in continuous functioning.
Nevertheless, there are few stranded passengers in the airport, in spite of that there are 400 cots prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday evening there were already many accidents.
In the evening a truck driver died in a collision with a train in a route crossing in Ostholstein.
The machinist suffered light wounds.
In the proximities of Nuremberg a similar accident took place because of the covered with snow streets: Also here a truck was reached in a routes crossing because the vehicle remained bolted.
The driver lost the life.
In the train four passengers turned out to be injured men, the Bayreuth trip to Nuremberg was blocked for this motive in the morning.
Also a 30-year-old woman died, after giving one, I overturn with his car close to Aschaffenburg in a slippery highway.
The meteorologists have a good news: The snow will be softer and softer and a type dust and therefore it will swirl in soft gusts.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic sea will turn out to be affected by strong and rapid winds.
Undoubtedly it will keep on being very cold, in some places up to 15 negative grades.
Deusche Bank looks for a buyer for his twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate of his symbol: According to an article, buyer looks for the financial institution for his office towers in his Frankfurt head office.
The property might reach port up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged his head office: The twin towers modernized in the quarter of the banks of Frankfurt; while the bankers returned to his place of ancient work.
But now profit wants in appearance to extract the financial consortium the costs of the reonvación, and a buyer looks for two skyscrapers, as affirms "Financial Times Deutschland" basing on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the motives of the sale in project.
"We always verify if it is convenient to possess the properties or to sell them and next to rent them again," he affirmed.
That's why the biggest credit institution of Germany resigns again from the head office of his company after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros of the investor of a fund of the house and next it realized the pertinent arrangements.
The energy reforms reached a few numbers of approximately 200 millions of euros.
A sale would suppose a lot of money for the bank.
The experts of this ambience calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed like "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If there sell the buildings renewed in a fund of the bank or there has not been revealed an independent investor at present, affirmed the spokesman.
Thousands of persons of mourning for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10.000 persons thought about the buried miners, who were considered deceased after many explosions in a mine.
They could not have found the corpses yet, because the accident control measures keep on being precarious in the place of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the mine Pike River close to the city of Greymouth.
29 ages miners between 17 and 62 years remained buried in the mine.
A probe got in the place of the misfortune, but it did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of poisonous gases and successive explosions, no team of rescue could go down because of safety.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there were no possibilities that the miners had survived.
They could not have recovered the bodies up to the date.
At present the relatives and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand persons have changed with the shining sheen of the sun into Greymouth in the neozelandesa island of the south.
They keep silence during two minutes.
In homage of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
Also there were photos and personal objects, below garments and stage of surfing.
The flags rippled to half a flagstaff before the governmental buildings of the country.
New Zealand hoped that the miners should return to the surface "of the depths of the ground," said John Key, the prime minister neozelandés, to the participants of the commemorative act.
"But they never returned to house."
It cannot assume the death of his son until it has not seen his body, affirmed Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the prime minister and the relatives of the victims many foreign diplomats took part at once commemorative.
In the first explosion on November 19 also there were buried miners of British and South African origin.
The rescue workpeople started by extinguishing a fire inside the coalmine in the island of the south of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the burning temperatures of the interior of the mine will begin to descend, there declared Gary Knowles, the Superior of the police, to the journalists.
To the devil, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic movies?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores again the borders of the genre with his epic of battles "Walhalla Rising."
About what public will the governing Danish Nicolas Winding Refn have thought on having rolled "Walhalla Rising"?
A warlike imprisoned Viking with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberates of his tormentors and murderess his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, ideal sounds for young spectators who look for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes using brutal methods to kill and to start to his enemies the intestines of his alive bodies when it is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, like it is called in fact, he does not say almost any word during the whole movie and other personages allow to take for as very much one or two phrases or a pair of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise they are kept silent and enjoy the nice and terrifying hilly sceneries of Scotland, which the frames offer to the world hace Viking approximately thousand years.
Rather ideal for grown and interested film makers in the existentialism and in much calmed movements of camera.
When a movie has several groups of recipients it is a sorrow that they could not discard mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy on the brushed trafficker of drugs "Pusher" like a species of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to do with fortitude that his works are for all the publics with anything more about humor in the main current or slightly less of brutality of the artistic house.
A cerebral mass and a few intestines that sprout cannot dissuade most of the followers of the artistic movies.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a missionaries' troop cristioneros violent for interpretable motives and an eternity remains jammed in the calmness and the fog before his team comes to America and is kept silent again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found cinematographic distributor in Germany and only it is published in DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody front, one hides a piece of sometimes exciting movies, which some attention deserves.
This movie treats neither about dialogues nor about a logical action, everything is an ambience, a feverish sleep transformed into movie.
And that's why there is no way out for the spectators.
Refn condede scarcely a moment of relaxation and his images glaciers and the lugubrious sound-track of situation does to him a knot in his gullet, especially, the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the personages goes towards him.
Only a small fair-haired young man, who supports Unojo faithfully, preserves something like innocence, all the rest are possessed by the anger.
Especially, the hero of only one eye, which motives are never explained, turns in any moment into a warrior gone out of the hell for enemies and provisional Allied Forces, possibly into the ambassador of the same devil.
The representa the perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyhow.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that it is possible to hate and to admire, to get angry, to falter and to be surprised.
Una experiencia.
Mysterious ground movements
The organization of nuclear energy OIEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country pushes back to think about this topic until control panel should be allowed.
On the midnight from September 5 until September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli planes of combat F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is in the shore of Euphrat; the biggest and more nearby city, to 30 kilometers Dair is an expert-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Organism of Atomic energy (OIEA), treats on a reactor that apparently the Syrians constructed with help of North Korea in the bucket hidden in a vale that goes out of the river.
According to information of the service of international intelligence of the USA of the CIA of ends of April, 2008, I design a current reactor under the name of the proximities of the-Kibar much adapted for the production of plutonium, with which the nuclear weapons are constructed.
On the other hand, the skill scarcely serves for other ends than for those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a presentation in video with blurry satellite images.
They showed with an animation for computer where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a limited copy of the model norcoreano of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
Also they taught photos that were showing the building from the proximities or from the interior.
It was doing a little time that the reactor was in functioning, he says, but it was not equipped with fuel bars yet.
Today, three years later than the bombing, it is scarcely more well-known that at that time, the puzzlers became major with the time.
The previous president of the USA, George W. Bush revealed recently in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA he completely was sure that the Syrians had constructed a reactor in the-Kibar, but that scarcely it saw indications of which in the country "a program of nuclear weapons" existed.
In Europe, several agents of the secret service prefer to be even more prudent and only they speak about a "supposed reactor," although they think the presentation of the CIA "commendable."
They lack solid tests, as well as to the OIEA.
When one asked him how sure it was to have ahead a reactor, a diplomatic high place of the GNU answered in summer of a lapidary way that the OIEA has "enough material to have questions."
The Syrians came undone with a lot of rapidity of the debris of the supposed "military building rendered useless" and leveled the area to conscience.
Nevertheless, in June, 2008 a team of the OIEA under the control of the previous governing chief Olli Heinonen thought rastos of uranium in the-Kibar, that it had been made by persons.
Also the OIEA obtained images for satellite on a member state, of commercial sellers in the moments just after the attack, which they must have a major informative value than the CIA presented.
Nevertheless, these photos did not come to the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them in an exclusive way.
That's why the OIEA cannot verify his authenticity independently.
Syria always gave to understand that it had never had a secret nuclear program not built no reactor.
The uranium was coming from the Israeli weapon, told Damaskus.
The OIEA pushed it back like improbable after the analyses of the particles.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discuss on this matter, of equal way that with regard to the images for satellite.
Also, to the controlers the second examination is prohibited them in the-Kibar and the entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Also Israel keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in functions at the moment of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
This way, the investigation of the case has not given results from June, 2008 and "it transforms progressively in a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a western diplomat of high charge corresponds to a place in the OIEA in Vienna, finally a serious infraction is hanging against the nonproliferation treaties of atomic weapon, over which the OIEA looks.
The OIEA considers three more teams to be the key for the progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the supposed reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not announced publicly until now of what teams they talk each other, not what functions they have, not if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated like internal grasp Marj sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah again derived from the proximities of the placed cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a building complex close to Masyaf with the images for satellite, that very probably it is a question of one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly it is in or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits with this motive the entry to three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians are afraid of a record that the USA has requested the OIEA to spy on the military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert on the teams thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the USA.
By means of photos for satellite, the OIEA has indications of which material moves between three places and the bucket to the shore of the Euphrat.
A western diplomat with a high charge in Vienna affirmed that at least one of the teams can be "related to the fuel production."
But there is no "any indication of sensitive activities," either of enrichment of uranium or of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the nuclear weapons construction.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium that is not enriched.
Where from must the uranium come and where the plutonium must separate later for the bombs, for these central questions there are, ideally, commendable assumptions.
Neither are doubts if the ruins, the valuable tracks that can recover, are in three places.
Since they eliminated the hundreds of load of the trucks of the soil, nobody has information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers the salt mine to be improbable to the-Tibni, placed in few kilometers from the-Kibar to another part of the Euphrat, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as his aptitude like area for radioactive wastes.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the OIEA, related it to the reactor in an analysis of the images for satellite for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photos from the orbit show that the Syrians carried grounds movements out in three supposed suspicious places and eliminated big containers after the OIEA was requesting the entry.
It can be a coincidence but scarcely he helps to remove the suspicion.
Also, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the OIEA has used some months to develop an examinations plan there, which the Syrians were allowing, to keep the possible military secret, alone the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus criticizes also this proposal.
The western diplomats in Vienna one year ago calmed down with that the reactor was already destroyed, that's why the matter has no urgency great, for a pair of months, Glyn Davies, a type of ambassador of the USA uses the called exceptional examinations, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish the control panel.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the OIEA, who must propose these examinations, has spoken of "an option for which I am opened in the future," but it still hesitates.
This way is very risky: For it there are needed most of the council of government of the OIEA, and some of 35 countries there represented are not precisely anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, since a diplomat reflected: "And what raisin if in the end they do not find anything?"
The love in the times of the war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in summer with the direction of his début still without name.
She has written the script, a love story herself between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
It is not known much more on this matter, but this is sufficient for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, he falls in love with his Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
The associations of Bosnian women have protested quickly, with which in the last moment they moved some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The movie has been rolled in Hungary and in the post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the victims' women's organization of the war wrote to the High Police station of the UNO, ACNUR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassadress of the High Police station of the UNO for the refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that it pushed back.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, affirms Hasecic.
Love stories do not happen in the violations fields, and the Jolie position on this matter denounces the victims the sufficient thing on the script.
His organization in accordance with the High Police station of the UNO for the refugees has recommended to dismiss Jolie as ambassadress, reports the Guard.
But what has Jolie written exactly for the scenes?
The Bosnian department of culture that read the script, granted after a tira and a permission of recording slackens in Sarajevo, it is not completely clear porqué Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young authoress repeats that it does not chase political intentions with his movie, gets with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the implied parts.
His content keeps on being vague.
In the network it circulates the second synopsis of the movie that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and they are again when she, a Moslem Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field at which he is employed like guard.
What sounds greatly differently is the variant "violation victim falls in love with tormentor."
It is sure that the Jolie movie begins really before the war.
The pressure on her, affirms Jolie, is "unjust and based on erroneous information."
At present they can achieve the peace with the hackers of Hollywood: While the script continues in the network of an illegal way, like many others previously.
Not at all how far from here
This evening finally is good again for the Irishes.
No affliction track
On the other hand, the team of house dominates on his clients of Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans shout of happiness while the high music resounds, strike the soil with the feet.
The club Bailey vibrates in the sudirlandés Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a three meters distance
The strange spectacle is called "Beerpong," and the award for the winner 500 more euros are a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world cup in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type, this slovenly game of drink and the discreet computer programmer in fact do not do good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to amuse himself with that, to relax about the fulminating question, what will provide the future.
The diversion in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January it will realize a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad foreboding," he affirms.
"It is very far of house and I still have no work there."
At least: His fiancée waits for him in Auckland, "it pulled one it obtained the work of his sleep like events agent, perhaps be a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad perspectives at home, two of three brothers of Tanners have already looked for luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin is employed at present like YOUR adviser at Londrés.
The young people goes away: In the island there are many families as that of the Tanners.
100.000 Irishes will leave the country in a nearby future, there predict the experts in economy and the institute of social research ESRI of Dublin.
Until 2015 200.000 emigrants are counted.
A big loss for this small country with only 4,5 millions of inhabitants.
The prognoses are confirmed, there comes a migratory wave comparable to the one that suffered the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that trajó a big well-being to the Irishes, at present extends the melancholy.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young people, well formed Irishes, for whom till now, everything is slope arrives.
The loss of employment and the social descent seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
They all need that there is money in abundance.
But three of every ten men and women younger than thirty years are unemployed.

"The last one that closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, student of right and the president of the union of Irish students sees a shaded future appearing because the alone government devotes itself to assemblies and it already does not offer future perspectives to the young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," affirms the 20-year-old girl.
He observes how his partners go of a few practices not reumneradas to the following ones.
His biggest worry, he tells, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Persons as Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic of a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers a service concerning the topic of working abroad.
"For those who begin to work, to do it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," affirms the manager.
On his web page photos of a boy appear practising surfing in Australia and of other practising snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, if not that bears freedom and diversion.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows how it is to construct something in another place.
Since there was already nothing that to do for the 29-year-old engineer, at present is employed with 15 Irish partners at the construction in Germany.
Now they raise a fashions shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January it goes away to Hannover or to Berlin, to the following project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only seldom because it works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he affirms, since long ago of the first time that trod on the threshold of his house.
"I gain money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am never so well."
He laughs slightly ashamed and goes away for frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with elegant gardens before the houses, in the entry big and expensive cars are parked.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380.000 euros, 100 for hundred financed ones by a credit.
"There were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Is it afraid of failing with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a little bit, serves more warm tea and says: "I do not have children whom it has to feed and am young; if everything goes out badly, I can begin from zero."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints to that he listens often at present.
"Nobody must spend famine, our situation is not, with a lot of difference, so dramatic as in last times here in the island," he affirms.
"To work a period abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irishes."
He laughs and tells on his father, that in the last big economic crisis it went away to England.
"After seven years it returned and the life continued in Ireland, very simply."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
To make the future hanging and simply to see as it is the life in another part.
It worked already a pair of years in London: and why was not it they going to be fine to him and to his fiancée in New Zealand?
But in these days there is a thing that worries him of exceedingly: the celebration of his 27 birthdays on Friday in Dublin.
He is afraid that it could degenerate into a farewell holiday.
"Only, not too many emotions," he says and gives a big gulp to his beer.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a holiday of going, very relaxed, with a pair of friends, a pair of drinks, a pair of games."
The democratic routine
The support keeps on increasing to the democracy in Latin America, as well as the support to the private enterprises.
The crime generates major worry than the unemployment.
Also, largely of the region, Brazil is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey of the Latinobarómetro realized in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been celebrated regularly from 1995, it allows to realize a pursuit of the attitude changes in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, realized in September and beginning of October, they emphasize two related questions.
The first one is the reigning relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second one is the increasing stability of the attitudes towards the democracy and his principal institutions.
The support to the democracy has increased greatly in diverse countries of the coast of the Pacific Ocean of South America (I consulted the table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth has reached an average per year of 6% from 2002, the support to the democracy has increased from a limited one 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It grew also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big descent of the production last year.
Nevertheless, only half of the interrogated persons of Mexico and Brazil, two countries most filled with the area, is convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (2 consults the graph).
About 44% of the interrogated persons in the region declared himself satisfied with the way in which the democracy works in practice in his country, the same number as the year past, but greatly superior to 25% registered in 2001 (graph 3).
About 34% affirmed that they were trusting in the Congress of his country and 45% in his Government, the same quantity as last year in both cases, but greatly top as regards 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turbulencies in Latin America affected seriously to the support to the democracy.
The fact that it has been supported during the world financial crisis probably be due to the fact that numerous Latin-American countries just turned out to be affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Also, the existence of a social network of stronger safety has helped to protect the poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans who live in poverty conditions only I increase marginally in 2009 and that it has diminished again this year, up to 32%).
Nevertheless, the frame of mind changes greatly of one country to other (4 consults the graph).
The good economic yields of Brazil and the popularity of his projecting president, Luiz Inácio Lula gives Miscellany, is reflected in a general progress feeling.
The above mentioned feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since they began the surveys, more interrogated persons in Latin America mention the crime, instead of the unemployment, like the most serious problem which there faces his country (5 consults the graph).
About 31% affirms that, he should be they or a nearby relative, he has been a victim of the crime in the last year, a number that has diminished from 38% of last year and that is the minor percentage registered from 1995.
The most positive economic yields are reflected in a major support to the private enterprises and to the market economy: about 71% of the interrogated persons in the region affirms that the private enterprises are indispensable for the development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (6 consults the graph).
About 58% agrees in that the market economy is the only system that will allow his country to develop, opposite to 47% last year.
It turns out to be interesting that 62% of the interrogated persons in Venezuela thinks the same (and 80% endorses the private enterprises), although his leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private enterprises.
Brazil is the country that exercises a major leadership in the region, as there indicates 19% of the interrogated persons (opposite to 18% last year), continued by the United States (9%, the same number as last year) and Venezuela (9% opposite to 11% one year ago).
Nevertheless, the United States is the most influential considered country for the interrogated persons in Mexico and big part of Central America, while Venezuela shows such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the garbage
Nobody was hoping that the celebrated general elections on November 28 in Haiti were perfect.
Nevertheless, they passed in a way much worse than there were afraid the foreigners who try to help to the country to mend after his problems.
Votes got in the urns, some people voted for several times, ballot paper thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and intimidation acts.
The electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, inclusive groups displaced by the earthquake of January, were strolling around for the area trying to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen of candidates for the presidential ones, included several of the most popular, denounced fraud and asked for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of violent them, spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the official of the United Nations of major status in Haiti, declared that they were "a few relatively good elections in many senses."
The observers of the Organization of the American States and of the Community of the Caribbean Sea affirmed, carefully, that "we do not think that these aberrations, for serious that are, invalidate necessary the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, which according to his opponents is compromised by René Préval, the unpopular projecting president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
It is foreseen that the tiebreak will be realized in January.
All the hopes have not got lost as regards the elections yet.
Two principal candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, the first ancient lady, have withdrawn his initial request in which they were requesting the invalidation of the voting.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that mister Célestin, who scarcely has support, if it has someone, has spent to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the epidemic of the cholera devastates the country and more than one million survivors of the earthquake keeps on living in shops, one waits for a big abstention.
Come the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not manage to do it due to an absence of organization.
About 250.000 identity documents, necessary to vote, had not been distributed shortly before the elections yet.
There is greatly in game.
The help donors think that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has remained clear, also it think the proper Haitians.
Advancing on tiptoe towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since it lost his husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, there has enjoyed a big friendliness between the public who has increased his popularity index in 20 points, even more than 50%, the biggest level that it has registered from his election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that could turn it into a successful campaign for the second order in the elections of the next year will depend on if clearly affected missis Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of his deceased husband, his predecessor and political associate, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mister Kirchner, who kept on taking enclosed charge of the economic policy after his wife was happening to him like president, had the habit of preparing budgets that were undervaluing the fiscal income, the economic growth and the inflation.
This allowed to the presidential marriage to spend the additional income to his tact.
Theoretically, the government of missis Fernández lost his majority in the Congress last year.
Nevertheless, the opposition is divided, a situation that has deteriorated after the Kirchner death because of a heart attack on October 27.
Some discrepant members of the movement Peronist in being able have faced missis Fernández.
Nevertheless, after a few chaotic meetings in which a deputy gave a punch to other in the face and other deputies they accused the bribe government, the Congress decided to push the budget of 2011 back.
"I am not going to discuss," said the president.
The budget of 2010, consequently, will be applied to next year, what will offer to the president a margin of even major action at the time of spending it.
The economy is improving greatly: probably grow until 9% this year.
The valuation of official inflation is at present in 11,1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the trade unions, they place it close to 30%.
Mister Kirchner, who assumed the power in 2003 when Argentina was at the edge of the economic collapse, did that the growth and the reduction of the poverty were his priorities, instead of the control of the inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed to the private sector and did that the INDEC, the institute of statistics, was adapting the official inflation statistics.
Will the president Fernández moderate now this politics?
It has summoned meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the trade unions.
Also, his officials affirm that they want to limit the wage increases the year next to 18%.
The economy has turned out to be impelled by the high prices of the Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
Nevertheless, the inflation has limited the impulse to the growth obtained with a big devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason missis Fernández is giving signs to want to restore the financial ties of Argentina with the rest of the world.
To beginnings of the year, the government came to an agreement with the holders of bonds who had refused to a necessary restructuring previous to the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that missis Fernández is on the point of celebrating an agreement with the deserving governments grouped in the Club of Paris, to which it owes about 6.700 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not imply the supervision of the IMF, as it is usually habitual.
Nevertheless, last month Amado Boudou, the Secretary of the Treasury, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to prepare a new prices index to the national consumption, which looks like the prelude to the cleanliness of the INDEC.
It does not remain clear if the President Fernández wants to continue in the politics when it should finish his order, bearing in mind that it already does not have his husband next to you.
If it does it, there will need to be gained the support of the middle class, big part of which has got tired of the kirchnerismo.
When the Argentinians return from his summer holidays in March, the friendliness wave for her will have drooped.
If he wants to gain other elections, he will have to decide if it repudiates or not, calmly, many of the politics of his husband.
I come up hurra for China
The voters of Taiwan are approaching slowly a species of more nearby union with the continent.
What thinks Taiwan about his big brother to another side of the strait?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70% of the eligible ones, came on November 27 to choose the mayors and councilmen of five urban districts in what it looks like a wide evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Proper mister Ma has turned a defender of the feelings for the continent, forging innovative managerial ties, including an agreement of partial free trade, the biggest changes in the relations with China from 1949.
Mister Ma spent the test, but nearly.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up by gaining three of five elections to mayoralty, it did not manage to obtain most of the votes.
In his place, the democratic progressive Party (PPD), who has inclined for an entire independence of Taiwan, obtained practically 50% of all the votes opposite to 45% of the KMT.
If there had been the presidential ones, mister Ma would be in problems.
From his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has diminished in about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections there could be seen the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy trucks of campaign and big agglomerations with little flags and light clothes girls dancing.
Neither was missing the mysterious attempt of murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was doing campaign for one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the elections.
A man of the multitude shot the young man straight at the face, hurting him and killing a passer-by.
The curious thing is that it was not possible to have determined if the man was trying to hurt Lien or to take revenge for the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected to the elections, sowing suspicions on the PPD and provoking that the voters were inclining for the KMT.
Perhaps the winning big only one of the campaign was China.
It turned out to be surprising that the matter of the continent was not talking each other in itself.
In his place, the candidates spoke about plans of public accommodation and creation of employment.
Taiwan normally enjoys his fact independence and detests the military threat of China.
Consequently, the KMT usually avoids to give publicity to his ties with the government in Peking.
But this time also the PPD avoided to encourage the feeling against China.
He answers to the new conscience of which the Chinese commerce is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
For his part, mister Ma affirmed that it had been confirmed that his politics with regard to China was acceptable for most of the Taiwanese ones.
It is foreseen that the Government of Peking keeps on bribing them with the commerce, in accordance with his strategy to achieve that Taiwan returns to the fold.
China did not lose the time sending a negotiator Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of the investments and the medical cooperation.
Undoubtedly, he would like obtaining also the political integration, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best thing will be to hope that the presidential elections of 2012 should happen for it.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago it was in a bad situation: his ancient leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned corruption accused.
President between 2000 and 2008, was instigating openly the explicit independence.
Nevertheless, under the leadership of missis Tsai, a new generation has arisen of moderated and the PPD is straining for attracting professionals and young people.
Missis Tsai has been received pleasantly like candidate of the PPD for the presidency, as your Tseng-chang, which fulfilled order under Chen.
Now his party is doing all the possible from demonstrating that also it can have relations with Peking.
Missis Tsai announced the plans of creation of a group of experts that should act like contact point between the PPD and China, whenever the negotiations could be carried out without previous conditions.
Missis Tsai says to the Taiwanese public that his party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to the hasty approach of mister Ma with regard to China.
Mister Chen seems furious for the change.
In a declaration expressed from his cell, he affirmed that the candidates of the PPD would have gone out better stopped if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
It even ordered mister Su, a pragmatic one, not to present the presidential ones.
Even without mister Chen interyielding, the PPD will have difficulties to choose between his possible candidates.
The KMT also must do a conscience examination.
The evaluations of mister Ma have been poor, in spite of the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to do campaign with him.
His absence of popularity seems to owe principally to the unemployment and to the increasing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman of the KMT affirms that it will restructure his office, as well as the home teams.
The big samples of the PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan to an approach is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese ones think that the economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the not comeback point has already crossed."
Nominations to the Grammy: the singer of jazz Gives hope to Spalding the election surprise is in the Artist's category a revelation.
It acts by request of a president and possibly the people will concentrate on you.
Hope Spalding, downward and chosen singer of jazz of 26 years personally for the President Obama to act in his ceremony of the Nobel Prize of the Peace in 2009, supposed one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination of high level in the category of Better Artist Revelación.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of the jazz from his album of 2008, "Hope," the nomination gives what to think, but he respects the norms of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not extracted to the market any more of three álbumes before recording the one that "determines the public identity of the above mentioned artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," undoubtedly supposed a big advance and, bearing in mind his light and agreeable vocal style, as well as a big skill with pop's influences, funk and Latin rhythms, it is possible to establish at least a distinction between Spalding and the way towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the most nearby equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, who lately have concentrated on the ambience of the jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy did honor with good reason to "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Los Entre los competidores de Iyer se encuentra veterano el-saxofonista James Moody engañan "Malhumorado 4B" y John Beasley teclista el-por "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favorite in New Orleans and habitual guest in "Treme," of the HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest inclines greatly towards the merger as in the álbumes of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a fully deserved recognition in the category of big groups, competing against the big jazz of camera of Billy Childs Ensemble and always risky Dave Holland, whose album in alive with his octet, "Pathways," was a big example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in his band.

The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of arranging
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the commission of local arranging after more than five hours of public, often heated testimonies.
The critics attacked the project saying that he encourages the terrorism and the cloggings.
Nevertheless, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected the local legislation and it would be impressive from the esthetic point of view.
"Many good persons came to show his support, both Christian and Jewish or bahaíes, of all the religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the vale of Temecula, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, like American citizen, it fills with pride me."
"It demonstrates that the justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only that speak very highly."
"In this one vale there are the wonderful people."
The meeting started at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted practically up to midnight; most of the time devoted itself to the people who was interyielding in favor or against the center, practically the same quantity in every side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued in the web site of the newspaper.
"The United States does not exist already," is read in one of the comments.
"It is a question of another Planet of the simians with missis Libertad died in the sand."
"America has fallen down."
The plans of construction of Islamic centers have provoked protests also in other parts of the country, inclusive close to the area zero, the area of New York where the attacks took place of September 11, 2011.
In the Vale of Temecula, the imam Mahmoud Harmoush it has denounced violence acts.
His gathering closely of 135 families takes years coexisting without problems in the Riverside county, but he wanted a space major and better than the store that it was renting in a property shared with a system manufacturer of leaked of water.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise up to 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4,32 acres surface in Nicolas Road, to about two miles to the east of the institute Thicket.
The opponents can still appeal the project before the Town council.
A microbe resistant to the arsenic calls into question the possibility of new forms of life in the Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use the arsenic as one of his nutrients extends the possibility of finding new forms of life in the Earth and, possibly, in other planets.
Although the investigators discovered the curious bacterium here in the Earth, they say that it demonstrates that it is possible that there are forms of life without the principal elements that they were considering to be essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow be with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That turns it into something very peculiar, although he lacks little to be a type of form of really 'foreign' life," mentioned Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, coauthor of the report that appears in the edition in Thursday line of the publication Science.
For time, it is considered that there are six big essential elements for the life: the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the phosphorus and the sulfur.
Nevertheless, the investigators have discovered that the bacterium found in Monkey Lake, California, can keep on growing after replacing the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"It makes you appear what more is possible," affirmed Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University, coauthor of the report.
As indicated Anbar, the find is important for the life search in planets different from the Earth, since the investigators need to be able to recognize the life, know the aspect that it has.
The study centers on a microbe discovered in the Earth.
Nevertheless, the call of a press conference to debate it, in that details of the discovery did not leak out, it generated a big speculation in Internet on the possibility that the report was indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not do it.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to impel his biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements that we consider to be indispensable for the life perhaps is not so fixed," mentioned Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, on the United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the team of investigation.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of an element for other in the biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not realized by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the institute of astrobiología of the NASA, which directed the study, centred on the Monkey Lake because it presents high arsenic levels.
The arsenic and the phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, therefore it speculated that a microbe exposed to both might replace one with other.
"The arsenic is poisonous principally because his chemical behavior is similar to that of the phosphorus."
"Consequently, it him can turn out to be complicated to the organisms to differentiate them."
"Nevertheless, the arsenic is the sufficiently different thing like so that it does not work so well like the phosphorus, what it enters and, for saying it somehow, apelmaza the biochemical machinery," tells Anbar.
The investigators gathered the well-known bacteria like GFAJ-1 and they exhibited them to every time major concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt themselves and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact of demonstrating that he can live with arsenic in his place calls into question the possibility that there could exist of natural form a form of life that uses arsenic, it is already in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, auxiliary teacher of microbiology in the University of Florida, indicated that the idea of that one could replace the arsenic with the phosphorus is not new, but there had never been an example that was demonstrating that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the first ones you were from the Earth, it pointed out, for what the investigators speculated that the first forms of life can have used it.
"Yes that suggests that other means might exist of generating life, not only the way in which the life was forming in the Earth formerly," indicated Foster, who was not part of the team of investigation of Wolfe-Simon.
The investigation was provided with the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
There have been the stolen dogs that were missing in Compton
There have been two dogs that were missing of the four stolen ones opposite to the motel Bellflower, as affirmed the officials of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles on Thursday.
Four dogs of competition, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the van Chevrolet Express of 2006 in which they were happening the night, opposite to Bellflower Motel 6, as pointed out the authorities.
Two of the canine ones recovered on Wednesday evening and two remaining ones were on Wednesday, late in the night, as informed Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," affirmed Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They have returned with his legitimate proprietors."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were, in what quarter, not the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is carried out."
"We do not mean anything," affirmed Whitmore.
"We are following a few tracks."
It was not possible to find the proprietors of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, so that they were making any comment on Thursday.
They met his two Akitas in a refuge of animals of the county in Downey on Wednesday evening.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (I planned, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a bitch of 10 months) had not incurred losses.
Pero Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek were trying to exhibit in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, continued missing persons until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the national championship AKC/Eukanuba in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention of exhibiting Trace.
Other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions foreseen for the days before to the championship AKC/Eukanuba, as indicated Peek The Times on Wednesday.
The south of California is one of the stops in the tour of practically two months that the couple realizes taking part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard did the check-in in the motel.
Normally they remain in motels and park the van just opposite to the window of his room.
They were taking another three dogs (a baby of boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, which slept with them in the room of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick hair and they would be more fresh.
They made the windows lightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard denounced the theft of the van on Tuesday at six o'clock in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them up to the Corgis, provided of microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear if a reward or not would happen.
The lion is ready to roar again, at the time that the MGM restructuring obtains the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and suspense, MGM has obtained finally green light to begin again.
On Thursday, the federal judge of bankruptcies of New York approved officially the plan "prearmed" by the creditors to erase approximately 5 billion debt dollars, leveling the way so that the company of entertainment of 86 years focuses his efforts in the production and premiere of movies and television programs.
The Thursday mistake confirms that the plan expires with the requirements of the code of American bankruptcy, therefore other legal obstacles do not exist so that MGM is relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will turn into the principal executives of what will be a limited study.
The personnel will come down of 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not go out of the Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes an instrument of planned credit for 500 million dollars, to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is syndicating at present the credit, which for his account he is contributing with 75 million dollars, and one hopes that it should be financed in the middle of December.
The process of restructuring of the study began in May, 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the necessary management to arrange his finance, while it was fighting to be able to realize payments of interests in 300 million dollars a year.
In August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-President of Enron and expert in recovery of companies in failure, he known by his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The tries of Moelis and Cooper of solving the financial MGM ordeals and there satisfied to more than 140 creditors of the study, needed a lot of more time of the awaited one.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parts agreed to put the company on sale.
Nevertheless, the auction attracted few bidders and none ready to pay more than 2 billion dollars for that the creditors were looking.
Before the spring of this year, it returned to the design table while the team of MGM began to be employed at a plan of restructuring that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was endorsed finally by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of the bankruptcy in the next weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will get multimillionaire bonuses for his work.
Moelis and Co., that has already received 1,2 million dollars, will obtain a payment for 9,5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, which have been collecting 375.000 dollars per month for his services of administration of the company, will receive a few "fees of success" of 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum glide to resume the production in MGM, which released only one movie this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight movies that will go out in 2012.
Also they glide to finance jointly two movies based on "The Hobbit," together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to coordinate a separated loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance his part of those two movies, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who possesses approximately 18% of the debt of MGM, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the biggest shareholder.
Nevertheless, the recent conversations between two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to support the balance of his budget for gifts
While the iPad is the principal candidate for being the most wonderful toy of this year, continued by, perhaps, the system of video games Microsoft Kinect, both can mean a significant notch in his budget for gifts.
Think that by the price of an iPad there can be bought five bicycles BMX for 99 dollars each one, and a game Kinect costs the same as 10 classic ropes of jump adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 canisters of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways of supporting his budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three sellers of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that he could buy electronic toys for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Law of Moore has been working; the technological toy of this year probably will have more potency, costing the same and even a little less compared with that of last year.
Also, while generally there are less new toys with associate web sites, two of more acquaintances of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, they have more offers.
And the toys impelled by batteries of button are increasing, as well as the toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here there are some recommendations.
(All the prices belong to Toys "R" Us, unless it is indicated otherwise).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are toys of plush of the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when his bellies narrow.
A hug is equivalent to a note, and the second hug begins to arm a song.
If you buy more of one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: Once it begins to be too tight, it cannot stop.
For singing combined with dance, Star Mickey Dances (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) it is the best option.
Taking given of the technology of Elmo Live of last year, the doll animatrónico of 14 inches plays games of change of shift like Simóm Dice, and can do the lunar step, thanks to his innovative feet articulated with wheels with device of blockade.
The children who proved the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained for the absence of a control of volume.
If you are a child of the 80s, he can remember Alphie, one of the first educational toys computarizados.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a rucksack full of letters of questions designed to turn a ride into a meeting with a notebook of exercises of amusing self-adjustment.
If you are suspicious of giving to his child his intelligent phone, here econtrará three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars, to 8 years) is 3 the cheapest and the easiest to use, presenting a keyboard qwerty; although the games do not teach with so many efficacy like Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first putting to important point of the line Leapster, with a newer and brilliant screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
iXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) it uses a system of the type iTunes to present games and electronic books, and has a groove for cards SD that allows to visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks scarcely bigger than matches box, each one with its own screen LED.
The target is to arm words placing the blocks in line before the time finishes; it is formidable for an unexpected competition of armed with words.
There are increasingly the toys that have some class of connection in line.
Based only on his presence in toyshops, the biggest two are a Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy to his son a pet in line in the Club Penguin, for example, there can obtain a Disney Club Penguin 2 " Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, from 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a secret code.
When you exchange the code in line, his son obtains enough credits in the shop of the Club Penguin for two articles.
These might include roller skates or a toy pet Puffle.
Lightly bigger than the sow of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last thing in a line of microrobots impelled by batteries of button.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 paws of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It is entertained to do a blocks labyrinth to see if it can find the exit.
Also it is lasting.
Ours was capable of leaving the table of the kitchen and even of happening a little bit inside the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of the law and order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructing sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a square of the city, inspecting with severity the nervous persons to his charge, expressing orders softly with military authority.
He wanted that the feminine members of chengguan, the burly police officers of the urban order of China, afraid and despised by his capricious energetic measurements and his inclination to the violence, were communicating a certain impression to a spectators' fistful.
"Road surfaces!"
"Attention!"
Show them, it whispered, "how the nice girls are!"
Four girls who scarcely spent the adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and exact pants to attract attention.
Four black pairs of shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on the hair tied with buns to blue and white streaks.
"Personally, I think that they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered all the new recruits to have a grade title.
The Province of Guangdong changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a blue supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of the force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials made a detour to an uncontrollable snacks cart, and observed it with the frown constantly during half an hour, until the street vendor gathered his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a change of radical image.
From 2003, the district has added his urban police 13 women definitely chosen by his appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give to the coarse police a softer, feminine side.
Regrettably, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase the negligible respect of China for with these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
In contrast to the police, these officials are authorized only to make to fulfill ordinances of the city, imposing fines and other administrative sorrow.
But the Chinese news means paint the portrait basely of a different reality.
In January, 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei beat to death a passer-by after having used his cell phone to film them while they were dissolving a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a formation manual for inspectors of Peking was stolen and published in Internet, in which it was described like flogging with efficacy delinquents without making them bleed.
This year, a street vendor of watermelons of Shanghai incurred cerebral loss after a tiff with five officials.
A video game full of violence, available for discharging into line, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street sellers.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," one was sorry about China Daily, about a national publication, last year after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded really meticulous "cleanliness."
The skeptics say that the current approach is very far of this.
After the district was requesting across a notice eight piece of news you recruit feminine in October, a leading article in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both things.
The notice of the district was asking feminine candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and five harmonious facial features."
2 had to have a height over the average, superior one to 1,6 meters or 5 feet, ½ inches.
The retirement at the age of 26 years is obligatory.
The officials said that the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"His image is the important thing," said to him an anonymous district official to Rednet.com, a web site quasi governmental.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they expire with the requisites, like height, weight, facial features, etc."
Later the temperament comes "and the interior qualities."
The feminine chengguan are like vases, he said, and added, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, assistant director of the office of administration of the city of the district, is not anxious for endorsing this description.
But he observed that the height requirements were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then there comes the demand of harmonious facial features.
If this means to be good-looking, it is a debate matter between the Chinese.
Of course, the handicapped person or disfigured it must not appear.
"We cannot allow a lame person or a humpback to come to work here," said mister Zheng.
"His image would not be well."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Square Baoguang nearly one monastery, has 22 years, with his colored cheeks and a mouth thinly curved.
She does not believe that the accent in his aspect is sexist, he said.
"Do you believe that I seem sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His coworker with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to his work on time certainly either, they said, because career ambitions shelter major that simply to banish sellers in the alleys where it is supposed that they circumscribe his business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen of street vendors who throw themselves on foot or in bicycle, trying to sell so many buns or tofú bowls as it is possible before being lazy.
"Mister Wang, it has to leave."
"We have said to him often!" miss Xu said while a seller was escaping on foot, leaving temporarily his car thrown by bicycle with harness of noodles.
The officials describe his duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing at his free hours.
"Very routine."
A reason is that the feminine officials lack the power of his masculine counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
Only men can threaten to denounce the offenders to his supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public animosity demonstrations against the bureaucracy, which are common everywhere of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were incited to mutiny after that there was scattering the false rumor of which a few officials chengguan had murdered a seller.
More than one dozen of police officers or officials chengguan turned out to be injured men in the night episode; 14 vehicles of the government were overturned or set fire.
For the time being Xindu has avoided such a violence.
But the calmness scarcely is guaranteed.
Only to two streets of the calm Square Baoguang, where the feminine officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 persons met in a corner.
The officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as it demands the regulation.
The proprietor of the motorbike was shouting rudely.
The situation stagnated during 15 minutes before the officials, with pout, were making way for themselves to the pokes up to his vehicles and were going away quickly with the motorcycle and his proprietor.
Li Xuedong, of 40 years, a coordinator assigned to the masculine squadron, remained behind, with his white ensign turned round to conceal his name.
As the feminine officials, the coordinators, 40-year-old men or more, redeem a role purely of support.
In contrast to them, one does not teach them to support an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said mister Li with entire naturalness.
"Most of the time is the public the one that begins the fight."
The district attorneys will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday that the district attorneys of the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the criminal imputations that arose from his affair with an ex-assistant of campaign and his efforts to assure work by means of lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that there faces Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered to be a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on his affair had national holders last year and it will damage his career.
The Ensign office said that he felt "of course it satisfied" for the decision, which came after an investigation of an entire year.
The senator might still face a disciplinary measurement of the committee of ethics of the Senate.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice us "had informed that Senator Ensign is already not a target of his investigation and that it does not have any plan of raising charges against him for this topic."
The Department of Justice did not want to make comments about the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many lawyers of ethics out of the Department of Justice, who said that there seemed to be significant tests to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, the e-mail and other documents that leaked out first of all in October, 2009 in the New York Steal they indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who one of his assistants was, to obtain lucrative work by means of lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the affair of the senator with her.
Missis Hampton once worked like treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign got in touch with several political sponsors to find work to mister Hampton and pleaded on behalf of them after they had hired mister Hampton to do lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had been recently an Ensign assistant, it was excluded according to the law of doing lobby for his ex-employer or the Senate for one year.
The experts in ethics said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, which were intimate friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the call "revolving door lobbying ban," that thinks about how to restrict that ex-state personnel uses his connections to carry on personal business.
Of the evidence that has become public, "it seemed to be a case it occupies first place facie of a conspiracy to violate substantially the statute revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington that specializes in clients investigated by the government defend.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, mister Brand and other lawyers of ethics said that the department seemed cautious at the time of accepting political prosecutions after several important reverses for his section of public integrity, including the decision of last year to leave the prosecution against ex-Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges for procedure misbehavior.
The federal district attorneys "they are clearly a few cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for the Responsibility and the Ethics in Washington, a group of defense that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that the officials of the government of high status now can suppose that the laws are not applied to them," it added.
Paul Coggins, the principal lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that it received a called phone companhy of a district attorney of the Department of Justice on Monday and another call more on the following day, saying to him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
The team of defense of Ensign had been cooperating with the district attorneys in the try of persuading them of that the senator, as his office repeated in a declaration on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments that it him gave to the district attorneys.
"I do not feel comfortable entering details on my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think that they took the just decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Commission of Elections decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the group of ethics, which alleges that a payment for 96.000 dollars of the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated the electoral federal law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough tests to demonstrate that the money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Nevada that had supported for the long time the senator, which obtained work by means of lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December, 2008 demonstrated that after the company accepted Hampton like lobbista, the chief of office of Ensign, John Lopez, he communicated with Hampton and said to him that it was "crushing" the Department of the Interior on a question in dispute.
Ensign also was present at a lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the secretary of transport to establish a meeting on behalf of the air line after it had hired Hampton to do lobby.
When first the news of the affair turned out to be last year, Ensign him apologized to his electorate and resigned from his position like the fourth leader Republicano in the Senate.
After supporting a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign him said to the journalists that it glided to be postulated to a third order in the Senate.
When the spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was already not an object of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator was hoping that the ethics committee should continue quickly the example of the Department of Justice and should conclude his investigation.
"Senator Ensign has desires to continue with his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire will aim at Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "chatting" in the lines of the room of the court.
Minute to minute, reports of the frightful testimony sent route Twitter.
In the end, says the defender, there were more than 140.000 messages of Twitter on the process that tackled the violation and the children tied to his beds in a house that was set fire.
On Thursday, the process extensively followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned for the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to come to an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted for the jury.
But the lawyers of mister Hayes have presented writings in the court that delineate the arguments of the appeals that probably will occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative affirms that the intense reports on the process, including the wide use of Twitter on the part of the journalists of means of massive information, it created "an ambience of circus," and such a widespread and immediate saturation with details exaltadores did that the public passions were exercising an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim might force the appeal judges to fight with the question if the new technology needs new rules in the room of the court.
"According to what I experimented during this process, I think that there is a real danger of which the inclusion of the new technology in the room of the court is affecting the rights of the individual to have a just process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, principal lawyer of the defense of mister Hayes.
The coroner Jon C. Blue, of the State Top Court, pushed laconically the demands back in a mistake last week, saying that the news means "were carefully controlled" and that there was no proof that the jury has been taken by the passion.
But probably it will not be the last word on the topic.
During decades, the courts of appeal have admitted that the coverage of famous cases can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historical mistake of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States Sheppard revoked the condemnation of an osteopath of Cleveland, the doctor Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case vs. Maxwell, who existed "a carnival ambience in the process" due to the mass media.
One believes that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the movie "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that examined the condemnation of mister Hayes half a century later, might feel intrigued by the argument that there might be necessary new rules to control the form of communication from the rooms of the court, some inimaginadable in the epoch of the case of the doctor Sheppard.
"There is a general worry motive on the impact of the new mass media" in processes of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a teacher of the School of Stanford's Laws, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said that this one was imposed arbitrarily.
The teacher Donohue said that some appeal judges might feel intrigued by the idea of that to limit the immediate communication from the rooms of the court might do that the judgments were more just.
The Twitter question is the only one of many of the topics delineated by the lawyers of Hayes, which probably will be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
The lawyers of the defense also affirm, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when the Judge Blue refused to allow them that testearan the reactions of the potential juries, showing them horrifying photos of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that they were terrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and his daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and Michaela of 11.
The lawyers of the defense say that also they will question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will support that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized the district attorneys, and who incorrectly had pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate during a weekend.
The juries were not kidnapped.
But his arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rejection to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the mass media continuously were throwing firewood to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of the tweets of the means, the cameras and the reporters out of the court," wrote the lawyers, "something was never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the whole state."
His attention in the Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news was more important than the dedicated reports more slowly, there were a vision ludita that would do that the politics of the court on the control of the coverage was weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal often were feeling attracted by the arguments on the adaptation that was needed in the courts due to the social and technological changes.
The lawyers of Hayes are pressing for this claim.
In his writing, they referred to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, which revokes the condemnation of the doctor Sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and left in clear that they would demand that the new means would need new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "Sheppard represents the case vs. Maxwell of the XXIst century."
Can the public-spiritedness stretch a bridge to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign for the invective and the negative attitude, this week has broken loose a little of public-spiritedness in Washington.
Is it a prediction of a genuine future two-party cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid return to the partisan combat in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any advance in the big topics that must be treated during the projecting meeting.
But since they say all, it was at least a discussion politely on the differences of two parts, as well as a recognition of his responsibilities shared to govern, instead of being another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The public Wednesday meeting of the commission of deficit of the president was the same way civilized, in spite of the political differences that survive between the members.
It seems clear that the narrow interaction during a months period generated a mutual respect that there comes out the ideological breach that still separates the members.
That is scarcely sufficient to declare that a new age of cooperation has come.
Now both parts are in a trial period, being explored mutually to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while they try to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
I motivate by which the Tuesday meeting and the later evaluations of the same one on the part of the participants were done by a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and they are very deeply established as to suggest any rapid change of the climate that existed during the last two years.
Be already that it is a question of taxes, expenses, health care or public assistance, two parts are in opposite poles.
Anyhow, the November election has smoothed the humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that the things have changed with regard to the way of saying the things," said Pete Wehner, an official of the administration of Bush now in the Center of Ethics and Public Politics.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections wake up partial passions, which then become extinct.
That is good."
In any questions, in particular in those that appear in the agenda of the projecting meeting, the Republicans and Democrats do not have another option to find a solution.
The reductions of taxes of Bush are conquered at the end of year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both parts want to find a way of preserving someone or all the reductions, in a permanent or temporary way.
In the same way, it is probable that there is a commitment to extend the unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot make to believe that they are in favor of the taxes reductions for the rich ones, denying the unemployment subsidy for the unemployed workpeople.
After the Tuesday meeting in the White House, there is major optimism for a possible dealing on these topics during the projecting meeting, together with the ratification of the new agreement of nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
Pero William Galston, of the Institution Brookings, warns that the successful cooperation in the pressing questions of the projecting meeting they will not drive necessary to a continuous bipartisanship when the new one 112do. Congress meets in January.
He affirmed, on the contrary, that it is very probable and up to inevitable, that it begins a disagreement period.
"After the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term the psychology revertirá the situation to one of confrontation" he affirmed.
Also Wehner expressed skepticism (which is shared extensively) on the fact that the public-spiritedness could drive to a real cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 like an essay for the principal event of 2012," he affirmed.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Firelighter Party, which they contributed decisively to his creation.
For more conscience that they have the leaders Republicanos on the dangers of exaggerating his position, they know that they must try to fulfill his promises to cut the expenses of the state away and to annul the new health law.
These partial lines are already observed clearly in the initial reactions opposite to the recommendations of the commission of shortfalls, which include the reform of the tributary code and the increase of some taxes and of the retirement age, and the expenses clipping.
Cochairmen Alan Simpson y Erskine Bowles have taken charge of one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to their own evaluation, they have introduced by force the question of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that it cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish his plan like an official recommendation, and have been fighting to come close to this number.
The biggest resistance is between the officials chosen in the panel, suggesting that in fiscal questions there is, at least at present, few bases or desire for the commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
The first one will happen next year in the shape of partial shocks, when the Republicans defy Obama on the budget, the taxes and the medical care continued then by a period of major bipartisan cooperation.
What would provoke the change?
The public opinion.
There are considerable proofs that, in spite of the political bias of the recent election, most of Americans want still to see to two parties working together.
If the confrontation drives to a deadlock, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will observe with attention the reaction of the people.
Consider whoever that it is losing probably it will change course and will look for commitment.
Nevertheless, this can be an optimistic vision.
The political bias and the polarization at present are major than they were in the middle of the year 1990, and there seems to be a bigger ideological hollow between Obama and Republicans of the Congress of the one that existed between the President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in his moment.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 like the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the antimilitarism that shows itself this week can be welcome for many Americans.
But this will need a lot of more effort on behalf of both sides to find points together in the questions that still divide them.
A leaked American document paints the portrait of Moscow like the paradise of the corruption
The control of the city is in hands of a "cleptocracia," and leaves a part of the bribes and protection money that it collects straight to the Kremlin, as he informed in February the American Embassy in Russia.
They informed that both the police and the Service of Federal Safety handle enormous blackmail systems, what helps to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow.
They collect money not only business legitimate, but also of organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what the Prime minister Vladimir Putin has named the "vertical authority," takes his part as the money rises in the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in his web site on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and he blames it on big part of the corruption.
The President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed it in October, but there has been small evidence of a cleanliness since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who possesses an important company of construction, have denied systematically the corruption accusations throughout the years, and he has gained several demands for libel on such accusations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked him on a documentary that he was suggesting that it was corrupt, he affirmed: "It is a madness, a canard, a nuisance."
According to the surveys, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that his society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the report of the embassy, and it is unheard-of that are the diplomats of a foreign country those who do that.
"The direct links of the government of the city of Moscow with the delinquency have led some to calling it 'disfunctional', and to affirming that the government works more like a cleptocracia that like a government," he affirms the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and of the mafia that literally means "roof" or protection) which the police penetrate, the Federal Service of Safety (SFS), the Department of Internal matters (MVD), and the office of the district attorney, as well as all the sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is in the highest thing."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are in the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are in the lowest level."
"East is an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide any services."
The report affirms that the SFS collects the money of the biggest companies, and that the police point at the small commerce.
A source, he was affirming the report, "he told that the commercial proprietors of Moscow understand that the best thing is to obtain the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the groups of the organized crime) since they not only have more weapon, resources and power that the criminal groups, but also they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection from the criminal bands is not any more a priority."
The note observes that, while the money collection is finished, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to the arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find his business closed by a pretext or other.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the struggle against the corruption, but he has confessed that it has achieved little progress.
The note of the embassy reports on men taking baggage, probably full of cash, inside the same Kremlin.
"In his struggle against the corruption, Medvedev has to trust in the bureaucrats," affirmed Georgy Satarov, the director of the group of experts of Indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"Pero él es una parte de esta burocracia."
"He does not belong to a political class, because a political class does not exist already in Russia."
Without the politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he affirmed, the corruption is inevitable.
To national scale, Indem thinks that the corruption costs him to Russia more than 300 billion dollars per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption carried out by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified under the position 154 (the countries are classified of less to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the note of the American Embassy, that hour of Moscow did not happen until evening in the night, of course will cause grief inside the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed by the weaknesses of Moscow, it might be an opportunity so that the Kremlin argues that it is solving the problem.
Interviewee for the CNN for Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents WikiLeaks might be lies and reacted angrily for a revelation that he was affirming that the American diplomats were calling it Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which one is an important factor of the domestic politics in this country," he affirmed.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done by such an arrogance, by such a pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of Jemeres Rojos forced to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly illuminated, with spotted and peeled walls, the director of the Secondary school Anlong Veng remembered the man who had constructed it, the last leader of Jemeres Rojos Ta Mok.
"Here they all love Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he worried for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, of 42 years.
Acquaintance as "The butcher" for his brutality during the government of Jemeres Rojos, the commander keeps on being popular in this remote ex-fortitude of Jemeres Rojos in the northwest of Cambodia, where he constructed hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where they still live through thousands of ex-soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after Jemeres Rojos was giving up before the government, the allegiance supported in a lot of time is being defied finally in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and the conciliation him allowed to the victims to face publicly the persons who had taken part in the diet.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school that for the first time teaches the history of Jemeres Rojos to the children of his ex-soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia they expressed the first condemnation of an ex-member of Jemeres Rojos, sentencing the ex-chief of the well-known center of torture Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these events, the anxiety has grown between the veterans of Jemeres Rojos of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for the conciliation and his attempts of returning to the Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear between ex-Jemeres Rojos, but they cannot do anything," affirmed Chhang Youk, the director of the Center of Papers of Cambodia, an independent organization that it investigates to the diet.
"For them, the life under Jemeres Rojos was glorious, but the diet has turned into a symbol of the evil."
"This is generating divisions inside the families."
During the government of Jemeres Rojos of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or they died of famine, illness or excess of work, approximately 1,7 millions of persons.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and demolished the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of the diet and his military men fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they threw an insurrection that lasted up to the last movement that gave up in December, 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla war from his bases in the mountains and the forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 90s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UNO was driving to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, big groups of combatants of Jemeres Rojos began to desert towards the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by forces of the government in 1999 in the near Mountains Dangrek.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while he was waiting for the process.
Without the support of his benefactors, the most ancient combatants of Jemeres Rojos fell down in the absolute misery that is common in the rural Cambodia, and many people feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few officials of elite of Jemeres Rojos preserved his local administrative positions in exchange for laying down his weapon, the level soldiers keep on being poor and not qualified farmers.
"These people have obtained few benefits after the capitulation," affirmed Sok Leang of the Center for the Justice and the Conciliation, which offers public forums for the whole Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have built-in the Utopian agrarian ideology of the diet."
"They were raised without any concept to carry on business."
Sister 55-year-old Lim, who joined Jemeres Rojos when he was an adolescent in 1974, fought in the forest close to Anlong Veng before devoting itself to the life like farmer of rice poor in 1998.
"The life with Jemeres Rojos was well," he affirmed.
"Ta Mok fed him all."
"But now the life is difficult because we have that autoabastecernos."
The current court of Jemeres Rojos also has caused worries here.
At the beginning of next year, one hopes that the court should begin to sue Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another ex-minister of Jemeres Rojos.
The order of the court is of suing the principal leaders and to those of major responsibility for the crimes, but he has not said if it will chase cases in addition to this four.
This not made use of much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the means has centred on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who a district chief was in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of Jemeres Rojos at the end of the year 1970.
In 2007, she him said to the investigators of the Center of Papers of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the prey of Trapeang Thma, a project about which it is thought that thousands of forced workpeople have died.
During a recent sultry evening, Im Chaem returned of being employed at the fields to his house on wooden piles in a dirt road in the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shades on the very dry grassland, Im Chaem refused to speak about his past in Jemeres Rojos.
She affirmed that if the court should summon it she would not present before herself.
"Cambodia is in peace and stably," he affirmed.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
The Prime minister Hun Sen, who deserted of Jemeres Rojos in 1978, also has warned repeatedly that there will be instability if the court chases more suspects, although the experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past" was affirmed by him.
But to face the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, of the center of papers.
"The conciliation, according to Khmer, is to join the broken pieces again" was affirmed by him.
"It is our obligation to assemble these broken pieces so that we could understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on Jemeres Rojos, called "To History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June like a supplement to the textbook of history of secondary school of the Department of Education, which contains less than four pages on Jemeres Rojos.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about Jemeres Rojos, in spite of the tie of the city with the diet.
Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student in the Secondary school of Anlong Veng, said that the new textbook was helping the students to understand an important part of his history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when it took the book to house to study.
"My family pushes back many parts of the textbook and the court," he affirmed.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure on the persons' quantity that it will process the court."
Such a resistance has done that the conciliation process is complex and difficult, affirmed Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court begin to produce an impact, he affirmed.
Anyhow, here Jemeres Rojos preserves a powerful delight.
In the Mountains Dangrek, a way with too many weeds and cutlery of disused plastic bags drives to a rectangle of the black soot covered by a rusty roof of tinplate.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a heap of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a cell phones seller at the edge of the way, said that he did not know very much on the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many local inhabitants go there to say him," he affirmed.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later this day he decided to walk up to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where it would leave a bunch of mature bananas with the hope to have good luck.
Accepted Belorussia to resign from his reservation of uranium qualified for armament
In a surprising victory for the campaign of the president Obama to protect the nuclear material in the whole world, the government of Belorussia announced Wednesday that will resign from his reservation of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of the nuclear weapons.
The dealing was revealed in a released joint declaration after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was meeting the Byelorussian Secretary of State Sergei Martynov, to the margin of a safety summit.
Per years, the American government had been trying to persuade Belorussia of which he was resigning from his highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had come to a point without comeback last spring.
But the American officials said to the Washington Post that there was carried out a pair of operations classified with Belorussia in last two months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranium qualified for armament of a Byelorussian installation of investigations.
This paved the way for the Wednesday agreement to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear safety of 47 nations presided by Obama in April, which excluded Belorussia.
And evidently it was a good achievement to assure the invitation of the Soviet ex-republic to the following summit in 2012.
"Really I felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place in the Summit of Nuclear safety of 2012."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," affirmed Ken Luongo, president of the Society for the Global Safety, a group who promotes the nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is a very significant and important "step" given by Belorussia.
In April, 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect the whole vulnerable nuclear material in the whole world in the next four years.
Since then, the American government has helped to six countries to get rid of all his highly enriched uranium.
Belorussia would be the seventh one.
A dozen of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Summit of Nuclear safety of Obama, the Byelorussian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never resign from his uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically an uranium qualified for armament) and the uranium of low enrichment," affirmed Lukashenko in this moment.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and they are not going to sell them to anybody."
"We use it with investigation ends, it is quite."
Nevertheless, Belorussia approached to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest to reach an agreement.
The officials affirmed that the first task of withdrawing the uranium of Belorussia, in October, it was particularly complicated, since the material had been radiated lightly.
The officials said that it was loaded in a special train that traveled more than 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the officials, the second operation finished on Monday and it was done in plane.
The American government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belorussia the investigations installation with uranium of low enrichment, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy that is employed at the Reduction of Global Threat, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated by a lot of care to strengthen the confidence" that he led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies thought this year that Belorussia was possessing at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belorussia will try to eliminate his reservation about 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Belorussia and the United States have been tense per years, principally due to the rough repression of Lukashenko of the human rights.
But the Wednesday declaration suggested a potential distension.
One declared that "while the progress takes refuge with taste in these questions of global safety, the United States and Belorussia admitted that a major respect for the democracy and the human rights in Belorussia keeps on being a central topic to improve the bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens."
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA with prisoners talibans and of To The Qaeda with direction to Guantanamo for Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram the ambassador of the USA in Madrid.
This way the leaked documents (cables) reflect it for Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pais, where he adds to himself that the first vice-president of that time of the Government, Maria Teresa Fernández of the Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to be able to demonstrate that they were exercising an alertness adapted on the foreign planes that cross Spain."
In June, 2006, after a report of the European Council in which it was accusing of complicity in practices opposite to the human rights to a dozen of countries, between them Spain, there produced a meeting to himself between the North American ex-ambassador Eduardo Aguirre y Fernández of the Vega.
The vice-president admitted that the report of the Advice "had taken the Shoemaker's Government out of game" and insisted that Spain did not have anything that on concealing in this matter.
"Of the Vega he underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid "to be caught unprepared," reports Aguirre in a cable.
Also the holder of that time of Location, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, indicated to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this matter the profile as low as possible, although, on having been in hands of the judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
For his part, in January, 2007, the district attorney Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the disqualification of the documents of the National Center of Intelligence (CNI) and of the Defense Department on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports contain neither any incriminating element nor any sensitive information," he told the Embassy after speaking with the district attorney.
Nevertheless, the USA reflected his worry for the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German district attorneys," more than for the disqualified information of the CNI or of the Defense Department.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments," he is sorry about Aguirre.
In March, 2007 in a lunch between the ambassador of the USA and the Secretary of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of his independence and they will do what they consider to be suitable," he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they were avoiding comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt for reducing the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his worry for the performance of the PP in this matter.
"Despite his general orientation proamericana, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize any indication of which the Shoemaker's Government tolerated or deliberately he ignored actions of the USA that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the USA," points out.

The messages belong 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs across testimonies of his relatives.

César lived with them.
When the girl went away to the Balearic Islands to explore the labor market, the child remained with his couple, who even went so far as to accompany one week to Palm.
But for the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance fractured, that they broke.
In March, 2008 it is in Minorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and spotted, because I have come to myself to work."

Then, he speaks about a message to the mobile that there have just received: "I want that you turn this month or you give me a direction to get about to the child."

The public defender, Carlos Maceda, told that he does not remember how the facts happened, "to have had intention of causing some evil to the minor."
Earlier, yes he confessed that he had drowned César in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defender and the district attorney requested a psychiatric test.
The popular ones would gain 4 benches in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP might be decisive in the municipalities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase of votes and deputies experienced on the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP already has the sight put in the personal details since, there is advance or not, the perspectives are more than prints, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually turns to the one that receives in the Catalan ones.
This way, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the personal details of 2008, while in the autonomic ones of 2006, the number promoted 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384.091 votes.
Of this tendency was supported to the rise, which has been nourished of a diversion of votes of the PSC and of the fidelización of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were celebrated, the PPC might happen from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would gain also four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would state that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and Spanish socialist party.
According to the analysis of the popular ones, ERC would lose a deputy - now it has three - while ICV would remain with a deputy or would gain one.
But, of the electoral calendar is supported, the most immediate appointment will take place in May, 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular ones also it can be decisive in the end of the socialistic hegemony in the four capitals of province and in his relief at the head of the Delegation of Barcelona, one of the administrations that more presupposed handles - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalistic and popular they coincide with the possibility that the PSC loses the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain majority not possibility of appealing his traditional associates, ERC and ICV.
Considering the republican disaster, it would not be ruffled that this formation loses his representation in the Consistory of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased his number of votes in the four capitals and it might be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are sure to be able to lead the vuelco in the capital tarraconense, where they governed with the PP rather than the current socialistic mayor, Josep Félix Archer.
In Lerida, the PP has been located only to 500 votes of the PSC, which mayor, Àngel Ros, supports very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the latter campaign, they were in several occasions.
The popular ones have grown also in other important municipalities like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to To The Qaida
In addition to seven arrested in Barcelona, in Thailand there was three
Seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian stopped by agents of the General Police station of Information of the Police in Barcelona were forming a cell yihadista that, directed from Thailand, was facilitating passports to different groups of To The Qaida, between them "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author the last one of the offenses of Bombay that caused the death to 106 persons in 2008.
The Department of the Interior has given big importance to these investigations, up to the point of making sure that with the "operation Kampai" the falsification device has remained "flagging" of To The Qaida on a global scale and, "therefore, his operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in two years that it has been active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy To The Qaida so that his "combatants" could cross the European borders and of other western countries with entire impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the only one that the network yihadista had operative in Europe, hence in the investigations other European police units have taken part, in addition to the Thai services, for what one does not discard that in territory of the EU blows similar to the developed one are carried out in the next days in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (there were detained the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand other one developed with the apprehension of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those who were directing from Bangkok the cell placed in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - her part was struck in 2009 - it was stealing principally from tourists passports that were expiring with the requisites marked by the called "World Islamic Front."
Namely the documents had to be addressed to males of between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
In means of the investigation it is underlined that, at the moment, there has not been any fact that it links to arrested in Catalonia with the offense of Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba," has been one of the receiving groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that days before this offense was committed, from Catalonia there were sent across an agency of transferences approximately thousand dollars that were "invested" in the buy of cards of mobiles that then were used by the members of the "command" that finished with the life of 106 persons.
The Police have seized abundant papers.
The PP demands to More that he should park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alice Sánchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday to exhibit personally to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture like president of the Generalitat, identical to the already raised ones during the campaign and that are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and knife-edge - soberanistas does without adventures, as it is the economic concert that the nationalistic leader wants to raise in the equator of his order.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the safety that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections of last Sunday, he codes more than sufficient to make want, since the CiU candidate needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstains in the investiture voting.
On a possible entente with the PP there depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to support in the Congress when general elections are celebrated, but, at the moment, the conversations that these days it supports More with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all the speeches soberanistas and pro-independence," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader tries even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders yes have in common his bet for there slim the political device of a very inflated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax of successions and donations.
With the details of the negotiation on the investiture of More they will deal, on the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet y Dolors Montserrat.
More it has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old people's home affirms that the deaths were not for "lacking in measurements"
The proprietors of the center of Olot do not discard that his monitor will kill any more than 11 elders
The persons in charge of the old people's home Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to emphasize the damage that has caused him to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while it was used there killed at least eleven elders that it had to his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the attorney of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person in charge" of the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility they force us to assume the procedural situation of civil persons in charge."
And is it that in addition to the social disfavor who could suffer the entity for not having detected on time the criminal activities of the monitor, the big threat for The Caritat receives now form of substantial indemnification that there are already calculating the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August, 2009 and that since then it has not stopped killing.
The judge already aimed in the car that was arranging the exhumation of eight bodies - ancient patients of the old people's home - that he was suspecting that in many cases no doctor was exploring personally the deceased but, attending at the age and the pathologies of the patients, the step was serving itself by phone.
The Caritat, across his director, denied yesterday flatly this end and aimed that "the absence of measurements cannot ever have been the cause from what it has gone on."
The lawyer of The Caritat added that "in the cause there is no only one indication of which there has been an imprudent action on the part of any other person who is not the imputed proper one."
The already baptized one as "Ángel de la Muerte" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 for, one month and a half later, to kill the second grandmother.
In this case it provoked the death puncturing an insulin overdose, in contrast to the first crime that committed it being helped with a miscellany of sedative pills.
The director of The Caritat aims that it is complicated to control that the personnel of the center has access to the medicines.
The pricks of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of nine crimes that the nurse, in his emulation to relieve the suffering of the interns, was using to give them death.
But there will be the analyses that are doing to themselves in the laboratory those that they will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and he looked for his first victims for a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, it burned them inside giving them lye as he has already confessed that it did with three women that it killed between 12 and on October 17.
In The Caritat they give credibility neither to the declarations of the monitor, nor so even to the number of penitent murders, which do not discard that it is top, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in small sense that he has that I changed his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That's why they say that they put themselves at the disposal of the justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The BCE threatens
The investors reacted sudden yesterday to the threat yesterday of Trichet who was warning "the markets must not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The differential of peripheral have closed strongly and the actions of the European banks have raised more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not also underestimate the aptitude of the BCE to be wrong and the euro scarcely there is repuntado which is a worrying sign.
What has produced yesterday to itself is own of an uncleared market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by closing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be late in losing the fear.
One month ago the BCE quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measurements and it will be necessary to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who stay.
The Bundesbank was demanding to finish the plan of buy of public debt for ineffective and to eliminate all the extraordinary liquidity measurements in term and leaving only unlimited access a week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that they should extend the current liquidity measurements "at least until March" and should support the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the trimester to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
Also we hope that they should continue with his program of buy of bonds and even that they should give the sign to intensify it.
If revertirán do not fulfill with the generated expectations the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain blinded in withdrawing liquidity measurements: that God attends to us!
As in his meeting of May in which they affirmed that there was no nor contemplated the bonds buy and caused the markets to collapse, tomorrow the history might recur.
The BCE must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced that the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday said that he had already bought very much, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the letters an auction one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The alone Treasure expressed 500 millions to 5,28%, versus 750 millions to 4,81% of the previous auction.
Nevertheless the types in Portugal fell down 30 basic points in the whole curve, reflecting clearly a change of feeling of market after the Trichet words.
In Ireland, there have been made public the numbers of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The dear numbers are approximately 10.000 short-term millions and another 15.000 potentials and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will remain nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are asumibles inside the Plan of Help and they help to reduce the suspense.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of his new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, for what Ireland keeps on being a suspense focus.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to relax the tension facing the next Summit of Heads of state and of Government on December 14 in that there is necessary a political commitment that demonstrates that we are an union and that we all touch the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch to Wagner and the rest the anthem of the happiness of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity on having presented yesterday the plan of measurements that will approve on Friday the Cabinet.
Reform of pensions, transparence in autonomous regions and financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measurements to reactivate the employment they sound in ears of the investors like four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange should have raised 4,5%, the double that the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
In contrast to February, the reaction of the Government and of the Spanish Bank has been rapid and forceful and we are benefiting of the effect surprise.
Today there is a key auction of a bond to three years that will turn out to be benefited by the effect Trichet for what we hope that it should be solved by strong demand and should help to remove the doubts about our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Help would be an autoimmolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, more than 40.000 millions have the Treasure in available liquidity the triple that in March, to the most expensive types and you closes the access to the markets sine díe.
Nevertheless, the strategy must keep on being that of the woman of César, "in addition to it being, it seeming."
Fortitude, we can.
The Eulen president will oppose the meeting of Vega Sicily asked by his children
The storm does not abate in the conflict opened in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and The Juniper.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will oppose, on having considered her to be "void of right plenary meeting," the judicial meeting of The Juniper of next 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in that they will try to make to cost his majority and to do with the organs of management of the titular signature of Wine vaults Vega to him Sicily.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and Maria José are perfecting the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in his litigation for the control on behalf of the group.
The founder of the biggest holding of managerial services does not seem ready to yield in his litigation to be present in the governmental bodies of The Juniper to the company.
Of his council of administration it was descabalgado for five of his seven children that managers named in the stockholder's meeting of January 18 of this year and which contesting is noted down in the Mercantile Record.
The judicial meeting of The Juniper for the next 16th, summoned by the magistrate of Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunders in the bosom of the family Álvarez.
The resource to the judge to fix the assembly is, until there is solved the conflict, the only juridical mechanism that guarantees the call of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marten and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez like a "desperate resource of the petitioners his five children for, by means of procedural cunning argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, to try to validate and sanear the radically void meeting of January 18," according to his official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the base so that, as soon as the meeting was celebrated, it proceeds to his contesting on having thought that it is "void of right plenary meeting."
The same protagonists, who support a discreet silence, already tried without success that the magistrate was summoning in June a meeting.
In The Juniper, hereditary society and holder of Wine vaults Vega Sicily, between other assets, seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services claims, nevertheless, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This matter is the question of law that the judge must decide once the sight is celebrated on the demand of contesting, for which there is no special date yet.
Network Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs progress in the cars in real-time.
Since Network Bull popped in in the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this select universe of the speed has been marked by the surprise and by the success.
In the first moment nobody newly arrived person took in consideration the options of a racing team and, in spite of the ascending trajectory of the last periods, last November, in the final straight line of the championship they all bet for the victory of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without desmerecer the skill as pilot of finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, not either of the capacity of the engine Renault that promotes his car, in the world of the Formula 1 has turned into a legend "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in hands of Network Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is a question in fact of a powerful software of process simulation that the German put on the market in 2007 with ends much removed from the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design chains of assembly of manufacturing factories in the whole world, you plant of energy, instruments of high precision.
The target is to reproduce, to simulate of faithful form the product or the process before constructing it in a real way, avoiding this way mistakes and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, of the planes of Sukhoi or of the most famous utilitarian cars of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, tells that the use of this computer instrument in his factory of Formula 1 has allowed Network Bull to design and lead to effect "at a few hours, almost in real-time," the modifications, changes and progress that are detected during the careers and in the essays.
Russwurm tells that the racing teams in the year 1992 had an average of 10 technical staff in his team who were capable of introducing a maximum of three or four progress in the vehicles during every period.
At the team of Network Bull there is employed today 180 professional young people of high qualification who equipped with powerful computer teams, analyze and project all modifications luck in the racing cars.
The Siemens manager told that to the software PLM it is capable of analyzing and of improving all the elements of the racing cars of Network Bull except for the engine, which performs the entire Renault responsibility.
There are modified the materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements.
The changes can take from the virtual reality of the pretender to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As the only limitation of this madness of the technological improving is the number for 40 million dollars that every team of Formula 1 can spend as maximum in every period to facilitate the competition.
Network Bull has mounted the factory of high technology to design and to produce his racing cars in a locality to approximately 50 kilometers of London.
It is a question of two buildings in which the visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything what there happens is considered to be "a secret high place."
The staff for this assignment promotes 580 persons, including his two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Network Bull, undoubtedly, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has put to the service of his participation in the circuits, there hide other protagonists whose contest is inestimable and his void fame.
The chief of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago it was possible to affirm that the advances of I+D in the wagons cars were contributing 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the extra cost.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced with the computer science since "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 proper shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration they are his associate Pont Reyes.
East will be the first of the network of 20 commerce of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational foresees to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will make compatible this initiative with 16 already present areas in centers multimark as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingles.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put like example the remodeled shop located in the Big Route of Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with whom he collaborates for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 mark points of sale in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones in opening were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being that of Barcelona the third one.
Blacksmith did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he admitted that Madrid might be the following destination.
Also director of HP personal systems made sure that the philosophy to install the shops will always be the same one, resting on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes charge of the exclusive movable design of the shops (with products that can touch of interactive form), which in Europe will have an identical image.
Also, HP covers the personnel training of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a question of an exemption system and emphasized that the exclusive commerce network tries "to improve the service to the client and to the pymes in the buy, the attention, the after-sales one and even the packing."
The shop of Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering pilot program on a global scale that is in charge of solving the possible problems of the computer teams of HP in guarantee.
A service online tunes in to a technical center located in Maastrich (Holland).
"This way, in 10 minutes we can settle problems that sometimes can be late up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for pymes and users, since the big companies already have employed services of technical assistance," Helena Herrero noticed yesterday.
Good-looking Sabadell for a million clients 'steals' his rivals in three years
More optimistic that other managers, the manager of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, he believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking, but it discards initially a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of the debit.
Despite it, he foresees a collapse of the margins of interests, which will try to be compensated partly with increases of commissions and of the price of the credit.
Sabadell hopes to receive in three years a million particular clients, his hanging subject.
Sabadell has found a route to exploit next three years and power like that to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will start in 2011 a new governing plan that will have a validity of three years.
The target, in addition to surviving without need to resort to the public helps of the FROB, is to gain market share with the reception of a million new particular clients-700.000 if there deduct those who can go out of the bank - his big hanging subject, since till now it had spoiled more the pymes and companies than to the retail client.
This year has received 250.000 particular clients and 50.000 companies.
His market share in individuals is 3,5%, while in companies it overcomes 10%.
Other one of the bases of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet for the productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction like target, and whose challenges the bank will exhibit when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to fix a few targets and to make public since the financial crisis is trastocado all the plans of the world banking.
In fact, Sabadell will close this year his plan the director Optima, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets did that one more exercise will extend it.
The clients who allow the savings banks to escape will be his principal target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Money box insisted that 2011 is going to be one "difficult and transcendental" year.
In fact, the executive believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Also, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment," something fundamental for the survival of the bank business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the debit - that penalizes the margins - is diminishing, the price of the insurances that are paying banks and boxes for his emission to obtain liquidity they are already moving at the cost of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The topic of the liquidity and the financing is structural, and it is going to be a pressure factor on the credit."
"We have not closed the faucet, but the differential are higher," he admitted Money box.
Banesto already gave on Thursday orders to his network so that they limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differential - to see CincoDías of November 22 and 27-.
Also he admitted that the tendency of the banking now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive frame."
The governing Sabadell plan is based on the organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, he makes sure that in Spain "they go to need major sizes."
"The next year everything is going to move," he made sure.
He affirms that the capital needs "are raised very much" and it does not discard that any Spanish financial institution between in red numbers.
And it aims that the FROB can fulfill to the market in the funds reception before new recapitalizations.
After making sure that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of the markets, it denied importance of what some bankers already predict like a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it is not possible to express, but unlike what happened in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing across repos, what muffles the crisis.
The MINT discards the second mergers wave in the boxes
The general manager of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that is going to produce to himself a wave of mergers of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is executed.
When it started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, there were different the entities that they assured that they would not take part in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
Nevertheless, the general manager of the Spanish Confederacy of Savings banks (MINT), José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that this new operations wave is going to take place.
"I believe that the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the Cajasol incorporation to the group of Civic Banking one cannot say that it should be the second round, what exists there are adjustments."
"Most is completely made; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 ó 14 but all the big processes have already been done and tutelados for the Spanish Bank, which in that has collaborated very much also," pointed the manager.
In declarations during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exhibited that the concentration process is attacking "at the biggest possible speed, and we have to be much satisfied of as it is taking place in the period that in due time, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Spanish Bank," he emphasized.
"To happen from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million in volume assets to 17 with 75.500 millions is a process that has no comparison in the history, reducing the number of entities in 62% so that they are much bigger to expire with Basel," it stood out.
Olavarrieta admitted that "there exists a series of sufficiently little lucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "an absence of seriousness and of sense," because "what does the Spanish Bank is to remember that we have to be in the term before the end of the year."
The general manager of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, made sure yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of the whole Europe and "probably" of the world, and attributed those who it put in judgment cloth a "absence of knowledge."
The manager aimed that, inside the current economic conjuncture, "we can be very calm" with the situation of the financial institutions and of the savings banks, a system that has tackled the "most important" concentration process and that "goes at the biggest possible speed."
Also he remembered that the Spanish banking went out very well stop of the tests of stress that the BCE realized in July.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to be supported in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions on the markets have provoked a double governmental answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measurements, from fiscal reductions to the pymes, regulation of agencies deprived of laying or suppression of 426 euros of help to stopped without service, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Cards and The Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
For other, vice-president Helen Salgado, with the support of ex-president Felipe González, has joined the criticism of the cancillera Angela Merkel for his responsibility in untying the current crisis.
How is it necessary to interpret these movements?
Go ahead that the Merkel position is not an error in his communicative politics.
On the contrary, it is another nut return in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, which collides with that of supporting the ancient traditions of the majority of his associates.
Opposite to the European resistances, in Germany it begins to be speculated on three possible exits to the crisis.
The first one, a strong euro integrated by herself, Austria and Holland, between other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second one, the recovery of the frame, although now it looks like a science fiction, with a current of very favorable opinion, near to 50% of the population.
The third one, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals of major macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, you fine to the countries transgressors, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it comes being defined for time, so now they do not fit you excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating the deficits, the German Government extracted of the sleeve a constitutional reform to them prevent from 2016.
This was the first sign of difference between what Germany believed that it had to be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in the public finance), and what his European associates were practising, including France.
The second one in the forehead gave the Central European country when Merkel lengthened painfully the decision of rescue of Greece.
Then it was already an object of fierce criticism, but the truth the fact is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the released one were much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the agreements of the Union, to make the rescue of a country possible and, at the same time, to force the deprived lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an antiEuropean, since he has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat edulcorada, it has been approved and, in the next months, we should be present at the process of reform of the Union that makes those measurements possible from 2013.
Germany has planned a red line that does not think to cross.
And he is saying to all that, although now it should be necessary to take measures with which perhaps it does not agree much, from that date the ancient functioning of the euro, it will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the inobservant countries will be severely sanctioned, they can be forced to declare themselves in payments suspension and, in this case, the private sector also will run with part of the cost.
Germany is indicating to us that we must continue a severe way of growth with high valuations of saving and investment, moderation in the consumption, progress in the productivity and competitiveness and positive exterior balances.
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction, with enormous holes in the balance of payments, like that he has presided at the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply they are not going to tolerate it.
The bet is clear.
And we would harm in not understanding it.
It is not a question of re-leading only the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand from us is much harder.
And the worst thing that in these circumstances we might do is to deceive ourselves ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulencies should open way to a major calmness.
And that we make use of the window of opportunity that they have given us, up to the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Shoemaker also has understood it this way and his clear double (the reforms promised after the meeting of last Saturday with the big companies and the yesterday announcement of new measurements) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it has been opened I travel the thesis of which it is necessary to clear up at home.
But the red line that Germany has planned there is, and it does not seem that they are going to move it.
And, between the possibilities that are contemplated, of leaving a monetary area too much stuffed with countries unworthy of attention, that cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to say to us that it had already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Stunts as those of Alonso and Branches before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not will to escape to a sanction.
The expulsion supposedly schemed by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party disputed on November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League has provoked that write to themselves ink rivers if such a behavior is or not unsporting and if, possibly, both players must be sanctioned by the UEFA.
Since it is well known, for lack of a few minutes to finish the party (that his team already had clearly gained), two players lost deliberately time at the time of extracting lacking footpaths to provoke that the umpire will show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will finish already like leader of his group, both players will fulfill the regulatory sanction the next party of the mini-league, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to go on clean from cards to the following phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two parties the trainer of the team, José Mourinho, and with different economic quantities to the implied players.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances as this one or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of the soccer.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of not written, but followed rules, of this sport.
Part of the debate arisen in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been led by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (that in his anthem it presumes of nobility and honor, and that sometimes spent has fined his players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, for Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his extensive history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate turns if this type of behavior not prohibited definitely by the regulation contradicts the beginning of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions law fraud is committed; so, in effect, there are respectful actions with the sports regulation, but they seem to avoid his sense.
The question happens for examining the type of damage that they provoke the sports spirit.
One of the goods that comprises the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions did not put itself in danger, that is to say, there was no violent game.
Other of these goods to which one alludes with the fair play is to prevent the team of the inobservant players from taking advantage in an unjust way of the opposite team, thing that did not happen either.
Now then, the paradoxical of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not make itself comfortable to what normally we characterize like pitfall or fraud of law, since his violation of the rules was not done undercover to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most clear thing this way to receive the punishment of the umpire.
They were waiting and they accepted with pleasure the sanction.
Another question is what type of advantage the offenders obtain in the examined deliberate absences.
Here it seems necessary to state that neither is placed in disadvantageous situation to the rival does not even obtain benefit in the same party, since obviously the result of the action supposes leaving the proper team with less players.
And it is not also a useful strategy for the next party, since the club will not be able to be provided with these players.
The advantage, obviously, consists of the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten his participation in a future party.
But it is a question of a long-term advantage, with a certain indecisiveness grade, since the change first ones can have left the eliminated team, and also with this performance the players fulfill a sanction party and go on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for cards accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle.
So that, of being spend rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Finally, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, of which yes it is part to take strategic decisions that favor to extract the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In the assumption that occupies us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this yes would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather they chose when to surrender to her.
They took a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment nor to flee of the same one.
Although the border between the ingenuity and the fraud of law is diffuse, in this occasion I believe that it was a question of a clear case of ingenuity.
The polemic, it seems to me, arises for two factors: because it was a question of two autoexpulsion and for the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out of provoking them.
The damage provoked at the beginning of the sport by these actions is not both ethical and esthetic.
Offers offensive to receive the Christmas groups dinners in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year a reservations avalanche for the 16th and 17th.
There proliferate the celebrations autosupported for the personnel, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, with the December arrival also they turn the group dinners before to the Christmas, which they keep on exercising of oxygen ball for the restoration and the free time of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis they have ended in a prices offensive fitted to be able to receive the majority client: almost they all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, there coincide the interviewed businessmen and associations of the sector.
To have just complicated the accounting, the calendar of this year (after the New Year's Eve to fall down in Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result up to the date of an avalanche of reservations of dinners for days top (16 and 17) and scarcely movement for the previous week.
Since it has already happening from 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, there are great the companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary question.
Not to do without the tradition, many workers support it paying of its own pocket.
Be which be the conjuncture, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the management one, to today, does not dare to predict how the celebrations of this month will be.
"The people think it long before reserving."
"He wants to go out but it has the alerts lit in the topic of the prices," it points.
The business will be fine "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and remembers that the clients stretch to lower a step with the crisis, so that the stripe concerning 25 euros has turned in majority into the demand.
In an opinion poll in diverse central establishments the requests collapse is stated for the night of 17.
In the group Soteras they indicate that there is an authentic requests boom for this Friday, with the pretension to spend less than 30 euros, to what they have answered adapting his menus to the conjuncture, with finished formulae from 25 to 35 euros.
In other of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Cheap hotel of Rita, Market, The Small restaurant and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has born more early reservation, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible thing to support them same prices of last year, with menus for all the tastes from 19,95 up to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which registers The Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a whole of 23 places, they stay optimistic after detecting a heyday of the invoicing from the second semester and the good some, although concentrated, business perspectives for the Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that 18 also it will be a hyperactive day at level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays.
They have added the Christmas one to his six group menus, with 30 euros or more like budget star and the perception of which there is predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, like wine-cellar.
Also they see green sprouts in some companies that invite again his personnel and sensation that the volume of the groups is slightly major.
On the part of the management Fecasarm (that includes entities as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Free time of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, is confident of beginning seeing the end of the tunnel and supports that as a whole the reservations are "cheered up," although the clients "negotiate to the maximum."
Of course, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, there pays the one who pays, it indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates big worry in the USA
Islamabad produces atomic weapon to "a rhythm more rapid than any other country."
The Wikileaks filtrations confirm the ties between the talibans and Pakistan.
The content of the mail between the American embassy in Pakistan and the Department of the State of the USA leaked by the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous worries that the Pakistani nuclear program provokes in Washington.
To the margin of the illuminating and juicy details that North Americans credited in Islamabad offer on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the diplomatic representatives, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries on the subject of atomic safety, instead of being on the increase, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a rhythm more rapid than any other country of the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapon is not assembled but they remain stored by components to make his destruction difficult in case of attack - it constitutes one of the principal reasons of sleeplessness in Washington.
This way the ambassadress enumerates it in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before to the visit of the adviser of that time of National Safety, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to low territory attacks taliban, the spread dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of persons involved in the nuclear arsenals and in the programs of missiles is contemplated, not already only for the USA, but also for Russia, as proliferante and motive for supporting the custody.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; considering the fall of the educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit the people who is employed at the nuclear programs or of missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Department of Location, in a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most novel of the papers filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is the every time minor cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in topics of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rhythm of production of nuclear weapons.
An office of the embassy in May, which qualifies of "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, supports: "The transparence is often nonexistent; the help offers stay without answer or they are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, states that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a rhythm more rapid than any other country of the world."
Ambassadress Patterson also asks to Washington, during a visit of the chief of the Army, general Ashfaq Kayani, who should make the person in charge "very clear" that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support the terrorist groups."
Un la caza del el jefe de Wikileaks
Obama names to a high place responsible for the antiterrorist struggle to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol expresses a red alert in order to continue the movements and to locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol expressed a "red alert" "to locate and to continue the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, traditional arrest warrant does not talk each other of one.
Also, it is not new, but it dates of November 20.
And it has not to do with the last filtration of any more than one quarter of million diplomatic documents of the USA but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian confronts in Sweden.
Also, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, makes sure that "the police know where and how to get in touch with mister Assange."
It was the 20th when the international police department with head office in Lyons (France) dictated the order on request of Sweden, but it did not reveal it up to yesterday, after receiving authorization of the authorities of this country.
In this case 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating to Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as has told the organization, yes they consider the called network notice free route to proceed to an arrest - that must attack the national police officer body - especially if they have an extradition bilateral agreement, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where he believes that Assange is.
The movement has infuriated the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has proved to be ready to answer for videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They remember also that Assange requested and obtained permission to go out of Sweden of the district attorney of his case, whom they compare with mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, safety chief of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit," denounces the missive.
While the world looks for it - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange continues in unknown, but not quiet whereabouts.
On Monday it granted from an indeterminate place an interview to the director of the magazine Steal across Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the secretary of the State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to show that he was a person in charge of ordering American diplomats to spy in the UNO violating international agreements that the USA has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the secretary of press of the White House, Robert Gibbs, which it qualified of "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I am not completely sure why it must import the opinion of a type for us with a web page," he declared to the chain CNN.
The proper Obama has entrusted to a high place responsible for the antiterrorist struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents escapes.
The attempt of the spokesman of the president Barack Obama of denying importance of Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim politicians and conservative commentators.
Peter King, the conferee who from January will preside at the Committee of National Safety in the Lower House, has asked to the Department of the State him to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and his funds and to chase to any that they of any contribution or help."
Further still there has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into target and use not crewed plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the minister baptista, exgovernor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"The one who is in the Government the one that leaked the information is guilty of treachery and any thing that is not the execution would be a too kind punishment," he declared in the chain Fox.
Puigcercós looks for the peace in ERC with winks to the related ones to Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret voting on his continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the system asambleario.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to avoid the umpteenth internal riot in the ERC lines, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party realizes that his resignation threat turns out to be insufficient for the related ones to the exleader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also he knows that the influence of this sector is so diluted today like its own mentor and that by no means it can cause him the headaches that it had with other extinct currents.
For it, the Esquerra leader will try to earn the new critics with winks that allow him to be reinforced up to the municipal elections.
To start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to declare themselves on his continuity secretly.
By means of ballot paper, and not to raised hand.
If the carodistas want transport certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do it without fear of countermeasures.
In fact, the lines chief wants to avoid the division image so much like that of subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he affirmed that the any more one would not be considered to be ratified with half of the votes, but it added, without specifying percentages, which a result would not be either good "to the Bulgarian."
The next ones to Carod demand from the president something more that to put his charge at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that does not cost when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But on not having had the sufficient majority to force resignations, they are going to try to agree with the executive a waybill up to May.
For it, they hope to take part in the making of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will submit to voting of the national advice on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for the fact that this one promises to move forward the congress to autumn of 2011, something that the dome already gives made.
The ERC leader admitted that the "polyphony" harms the stability and that his target is to do that, once and for all, the organization is capable of washing the dirty doors rags inwards.
In this line, there turns out to be symptomatic the article that the counsellor in functions Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació gave for fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for diverse targets."
And it enumerated five, of which two stand out.
The first one, to "mend" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, to include new faces that come from the related sector to Carod.
The second one can be the big innovation.
Huguet proposes ERC to liquidate at once the asambleísmo as mechanism of functioning.
This way, it supports a reform of the articles of association that allows to celebrate the congresses across delegates chosen by suffrage.
To finish with the model asambleario, an exception in the Spanish parties system, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who battled already in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsed conclave of 2008 left the order to the direction of checking the asambleísmo in a specific congress of reform of articles of association.
This appointment is still hanging, since the internal tide of last years was dissuading to confront the matter.
Now, without critical sectors to the watching, it can be a good moment to recapture it and to try to close it forever.

Obama promotes in Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you coincide that to approve the law Dream Act is the appropriate thing, it calls your senators and urge them to pass legislation is," tweeteó the president estadunidense in the popular social network.
The president Barack Obama joined today the national mobilization in support to the law Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you coincide that to approve the law Dream Act is the appropriate thing, it calls your senators and urge them to pass legislation is," tweeteó Obama.
His brief message keeps a cybernetic linkage open with a document wider that asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote for that one waits happen soon, now it is the moment to do that your voice is listened," it points out.
The message was spread later that 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless there approves the extension of the clippings of taxes of the age Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade announced in a letter signed by 42 republican senators, might affect the vote of the law Dream Act and of other projects as the ratification of the new agreement START with Russia against the nuclear weapons proliferation.
Questioned by the republican blockade to the law Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that as soon as the fiscal topic was solved, it will be possible to fix a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe that there is a lot of time..."
"We all coincide that we have to solve the fiscal matter before end of year..."
"I believe that we can achieve an agreement in some moment in that and later we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of democratic most of the Senate, Harry Reid, he announced Tuesday that would ask for a "vote of closing debate" for the law Dream Act, by which the initiative to legalize undocumented students might be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although next week is more probable.
The senatorial version of Dream Act or law of the American dream would legalize approximately 800 thousand young people who deposited the United States before 16 years, they have remained in the country last five years and they entered to an institution of higher education or to the army.
But the followers need 60 votes to approve the initiative, for which they need the contest of a republicans' fistful, in moments that organizations partial to the project lead an intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the law.
The democrats, most of which it supports the Dream Act, are provided with 58 benches.
Nevertheless at least one of them, senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said that he will vote in against, and only one republican has expressed his support to the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
For it, the followers of Dream Act need to add several republicans in case other democrats decide to give the back to the initiative.
Between the most courted republicans there are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the projecting senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the order of senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who supported in the past Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have declared that they will not endorse it in another occasion.
Another republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position in this moment.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts coincide that Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger in the ulcer
The second round of The pleasures of the language was a walk where the participants made a show of the story
"That thing about The sex in the language I understand it but...: the finger in the ulcer? for what does he expect from me?," inquirió writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, cycle that he celebrates to the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table devoted itself to The sex in the language, he told).
The finger in the ulcer... "puts us in predicaments," the Argentine writer ran sweetly through the public, for the most part of young people, that appointment happened in the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIELD) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where there took part Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define later as a big story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of the knowledge what the "ulcer" is, goes of doctor in doctor, of that it does not obtain answers although yes tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectólogo it goes out convinced: "the patience is not my fortress, perhaps it is my ulcer."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen the breath from him in half of the corridor, but who clarifies to him that it wounds it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the ulcer is the open real thing, the symbolic thing it is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the ulcer only I managed to know that it is the open real thing and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and the pitfalls of the language must go much entreverados.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful story that titled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the ulcer is not named but in a moment he uncovers.
With strokes of magic realism, account of a famous enchantress, that the same was touching clouds, was bringing back men who had gone away far or was repairing the virtues that there had lost a maiden, story that changed direction to speak then America, the big novel to which he did not lack from the beginning his own chroniclers that they were counting it and he quoted Bernal Díaz of the Castle who criticizes the excesses of the told for the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us to all (the writers) did mockery of the feigned witnesses who were appearing in the histories presented like real, but otherwise it had never gone so far as to count the history of America with imagination to which he was lacking up to the decency."
Nevertheless, he emphasized "they are the madmen and the liars those who better imagine" and it is where there converges reality and lie, where it is already not known that of the narrated it belongs to an edict or to other, where the fiction reaches his climax.
It calls it in fact the "Cervantine tradition'.
"For his heredity this are what is counted."
In his shift, writer Mayra Montero annotated and The finger applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIELD gave place with his round table in the ulcer.
The Cuban - Puerto Rican one aimed his towards the big ulcer of the social violence that crosses his country - and he shares Latin America - at product of the disputes of the traffic and sale of drugs.
"I believe that the good literature, the good poetry, the good songs shut up a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," it indicated, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readership, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the last one.
The night it was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also did emphasis "of this finger in the ulcer of the awkward writer of the writer."
He considered that in a world who lives to hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciences that redounds to dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a child not and behind every denial there is a child yes."
"To be proprietors of our thought and to be proprietors of the reality we have to tint: and to tint means to put often the finger in the ulcer and bother to those persons that they are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, black and white, about established ideas and without tone and to bother also to the powers that they prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is provided with three defeats in ends, has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already been able to reach in three occasions the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna y Monterrey in the final, also there face two different styles marked by his technical staff, who find between themselves with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano is provided with three defeats in ends, has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already been able to reach in three occasions the decisive series, although till now it has gone away in target and that's why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has ended up by consoling himself with the medal of the runner-up, a step backwards of the winners has remained and curiously with the same team it has played consecutive finals.
The strategist santista came to his first final like trainer in the Tournament Opening 2002, when it was taking the reins of the Morelia with which it fell down for global of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the Closing ceremony 2003 also came to the decisive duel and also it lost it with global of 3-1 and it was precisely before Infuriated.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén suffered a reverse again, since his team finished joined 2-2 before the sausage makers after 210 minutes of game, but in the pénaltis batch it put itself in advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three his players they failed from 11 steps and 4-3 suffered the somersault.
Rubén already lost two ends with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in shift, therefore he does not want to cover the same luck, it thinks about how to get rid of the curse and power to celebrate for the first occasion a title, although he affirms that for him the most important thing the institution is.
"I want to go out champion, do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a love to which I owe and for consequence the title will come for me, but the previous thing is the most important thing," mentioned the helmsman when one questioned it about the numbers that it has in against playing ends.
Very current it has the previous final, of which, he assures, has learned very much, "the only education that we can have is that until the umpire whistles the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the streak, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties for pulling already we were prepared to go out running and I believe that this is an education, until the party does not end can celebrate."
To know that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, a little that it does not worry him, since there trusts in his players: "One never thinks about how to come to the penalties batch, one thinks about how to end in regular time, but sometimes there is not of other one and it is necessary to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately did a bad move to us the destination, sometimes for the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in the hands, but it us went away, that left something to us by the this final for that we wait does not come to this instance."
Roman has in his hands to stop being a technical runner-up and proving for the first time the glory that the qualifications give.

NASA will announce find of extraterrestrial life
The American spatial agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a find that will cause impact in the search of living beings in the space.
The National government for the Aeronautics and the Space (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, the discovery astrobiológico, that might prove the theory of which yes extraterrestrial life exists.
The find will be presented in a press conference tomorrow on Thursday at 13:00 in the head office of the NASA in Washington by experts in astrobiología, science described as the manager of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of the life in the Universe.
On having quoted the press, the NASA made sure that it will present "a find that will cause impact in the search of extraterrestrial life," what caused experts' speculations of other countries.
The discovery might demonstrate the theory of which creatures exist at the same time our and in hostile ambiences that were thought uninhabitable, and they would put in the table the possibility that they turn into intelligent beings as the human beings if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a question of a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Monkey Lake in the National park Yosemite, California, where he lives in an ambience that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of surviving and of this capacity there increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other planets, which do not have our benevolent ambience.
According to astrobiólogos, if these organisms use the arsenic in his metabolism, he will remain demonstrated that "yes there is another form of life, the second form of life, different from that we know."
The spatial agency will announce the real scope of the finds in the tomorrow press conference on Thursday.
In the conference there will inform the geobióloga Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titanium (the biggest moon of Saturn), under the perspective of which his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Exploit PRD, PT, Convergence and Boss opposing 'block'

It detailed that in the next days they will speak with the representatives of the BREAD and PRI to modify the scheme, departing from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be subjugated again by both parties and with it opponent finished the coalition.
"So far it came (the coalition opponent), this is at what I look, because we are excluded, of any decision, not siquieran they have the political deference of considering the opinion about the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Boss, there are coincidences and for it they are shaping a plural group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, now should be "duopólico."
"It is not the spirit to the reform to the law that there is an eternal bipatidismo in the Congress."
To start, this group is initiating with 5 legislators, and they are conversing with other partners and partners so that they are more, the convergent one abounded.

Boss Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy should be respected, one gives him his place in the negotiation tables.
"That not for agreements cupulares, is left on the outside to 5 that probably we are going to make 9 deputies, now to the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to look for a place in the negotiation table, this is the topic that in the reform that they did that they matched, we are out and we do not agree with this reform."

They press to attend to tourist places
Tourist businessmen are sorry about accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Square Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a subsidence of the Square Sánchez Taboada, the tourist Mazatlán sector asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and places that are in the bad state and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Merchants' Association of the Golden Area, remembered that in different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination looks after and revertir the bad thing that the tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the stools has affected because the tourists come to walk and see the disorder and extract the return to the nearby business.
"The politicians there do not know what is to close one day a company and they do not have idea of the fortune that gets lost, or otherwise they were not doing thus the works as time and without the due planeación."
The hotelkeeper José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exhibited the absence of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town hall.
"The municipality will have to assume his responsibility and prevent from happening again, how to do it since giving preventive maintenance and not to fall down only in the corrective thing," it expressed.
"We are anxious to enjoy a clean city, because not only for being a tourist area must give the maintenance, but like inhabitants that we deserve a clean place to live and the Town hall must change his strategy to support well the city."
There are other places that also seem careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, so that it comes the tourist does not depend only on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in his beaches, in his avenues, permanent maintenance in what there are the tourist attractions," he said.
"The due attention has not happened and this type of facts shows something up that is well-known for all, the maintenance needs."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourist Promotion, expressed that there is urgent the rescue of tourist places of Mazatlán, since they are not made use in a correct way and project a bad image.
He spoke about a series of places that must put themselves in line as a whole with the municipality and be a priority to have the city a day, clean, tidy and that is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many places and historical and cultural places that it will be necessary to arrange first, to clean and to put ourselves in line to make them attractive to be able to add them in the inventory that we have to promote to the destination."
He asks for IP proved to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed the deputies to assume the big responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the diverse challenges that it faces.
A Term of worthy and free work of agreements between parties and of the state Executive he claims the managerial Mazatlán sector, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that it faces big problematic.
From yesterday there remained installed 60 term integrated by seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the BREAD, three of the Party New Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which adds a whole of 40 popular representatives.
Between the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State it belongs to that come to realize a clean management and to commitment with the society and with the different sectors that need of a responsible legislative work and that there do not repeat the same bosses of the political bias or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Managerial Coordinating Advice, proposed the newly released 40 deputies of the Congress of the State to assume the big responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the diverse challenges that it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really should exercise his right, you should free in agreements between the parties because it is a custom that arrangements do to look over the self-interest and turn into walk-ons carnavaleras of the leaders and of the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence he spoke that certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that they extract forward to the Leader in shift.
"We occupy that they come to do a worthy work and especially compromised with the society and with the sectors because there were the sinaloenses who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Island, thought that one of the big challenges belongs to 40 popular representatives that of pushing and adding forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push the economic growth, which incentives generate for the investment and infrastructure and that thing about the generation of work places will encourage some way."
As for the tourist activity, it demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that it covers inside the state budget to strengthen the state Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the second Secretariat in the state with presupposed minor and is incongruous like important and generating economic activity of currencies and investment and that of direct form he competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to that it is needed to label resources to explosive tourist projects and that coadyuven in giving safety to the state and in the update to the Law of Alcoholes that could not have resolved in previous terms.

Fourteen supposed arrested drug traffickers
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a ten pursuits has been realized in the frame of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
There have been detained fourteen persons who will face diverse accusations.
The pursuits have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, principally in the places where the production of the drug was realized.
"About 750 Cannabis plants have seized, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for the production," points out Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Safety of Quebec.
In whole, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including two supposed leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The arrested had to appear in the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the hours following his detention.
They might face the accusations of production of Cannabis, possession in order to deal, conspiracy and theft of services, between others.
These pursuits have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted nearly one year.
"It has been the information provided by the public the one that has allowed us to realize the detentions," adds mister Ruel.
In this police operation there took part about seventy agents of the module of investigation of Estrie of the Safety of the Quebec, of the Service of police officer of Sherbrooke and of the Department of police officer Memphrémagog.
One will be able to fight against the clandestine migration without problems
The project of law of the conservatives that, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the boats loaded with clandestine migrants, of course will face a big opposition, since three opposition camps have announced Wednesday that they could not support.
"I base principally on the Letter."
"I meet here a party that has created the granite on that you tread," there declared the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff surrounded with the deputies after the celebration of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals defend that the law project in his current form, which would allow to stop up to one year any person who comes from an identified ship as transports of clandestine immigrants, infringes the Canadian Letter of rights and freedoms.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, indicated also that it might not endorse the law project because it aims at the wrong white person.
"We are against and, as it seems, all the opposition camps are against of the project, so we already will see what does the Government," mister Duceppe declared.
The criticism of the NPD on the subject of immigration, Olivia Chow, has pushed back of a pen stroke the criticism that point out that his party is not the sufficiently firm thing with the clandestine immigrants.
"The neodemócratas agree in that measurements are adopted against the managers of the boats of clandestine and this is what we claim with another law project, the C-35," points out missis Chow.
"We do not support the project of law of the conservatives because it attacks the refugees and imprisons the children during a minimum of one year," tells missis Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused to the parties of the position of playing politicians and of ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The majority of the Canadians says to the deputies that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat to the country as if it was a doormat."
"They hope that Canada should adopt a few firm measurements," thinks the Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a confidence voting on his law project, what it might take to the country to a few elections as a result of his rejection.
Nevertheless, a conservative has communicated to the Agency QMI that the Government was going to request the celebration of a voting so that every deputy who is going to be opposed explains himself later before his electorate.
The new unit does not obtain the unanimity
Although he had announced to himself the possible creation of a permanent unit of struggle against the corruption and the collusion for Jean Charest, numerous observers keep on asking for the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the question.
The Minister of the public Safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not appeared two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York question is from January of last year.
The metropolis possesses a permanent unit against the corruption from 1870.
Consequently, the Tuesday announcement has caught for surprise more of one.
It is necessary to say that, during a meeting of the permanent Advice on the police services of Quebec celebrated last October 29, this measurement was never debated in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was sufficient so that the critic of the party quebequense that treats the question of the public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, was considering this announcement to be as "an extracted rabbit of the top hat" and like "a shoddy solution of last hour."
The Minister Dutil for his part, has answered those who are afraid that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the results when we announce it," it indicates simply.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the throwing of a public survey.
"The more mister Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this commission of investigation, the more people share our opinion, that is to say, that has something that to hide," he tells.
"The only way of having an investigation commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest," tells Yves Boisvert, teacher of ethics and gobernanza of the national public administration School.
To go out of this deadlock, he suggests to Quebec to grant a special order to the general inspector so that it realizes a survey of the collusion and the corruption.
"We must be capable of extending the order of the general inspector," it concludes.
Also, he thinks that Quebec might grant to the inspector the same competitions as to a commissioner, allowing him to force the persons to testify this way.
The creation of a permanent band is not the only project in blossomings in the Government Charest.
Quebec requests also Ottawa that modifies the Penal code so that he adapts himself better to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the district attorney of the operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
The federal Minister of the public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, inclines at present for realizing certain amendments as regards this topic.
During the operation Spring 2001 related to the groups of moteros, although one had not adapted the Penal code, 131 persons were detained.
Later, Ottawa impelled the adoption of the Law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme alertness
Diverse water courses are being watched closely due to the strong precipitations that have registered in several regions of the province from Tuesday.
On Wednesday evening a ground landslide took place in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
Like preventive measurement, two houses have been evacuated.
In the night, another ground landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A highway sank.
From Tuesday until Wednesday night, diverse regions registered a few strong precipitations, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, they are waited between 20 and 40 additional millimeters from now on until Thursday night, according to the region.
The sectors placed to the north of the river and in the vale of the Outaouais they were the most affected.
They might receive up to a whole of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations join the thaw of the snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, one is afraid that diverse rivers overflow.
On Wednesday night, the unit of civil Safety of Quebec expressed alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, already they have provoked floods in the past and they are under alertness.
In the Lanaudière region, the strong precipitations have provoked that were exceeding some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As prevention measurement, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes has provoked the closing of several routes, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The unit of civil Safety continues in alert and watches the situation closely, as has indicated Annik Bouchard, safety adviser.
The Center of forecast of the rises of Quebec for his part, expressed on Wednesday announcements communicating the strong rises of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They blame partially Dupont
The presenter of radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reverse before the Canadian Council of the norms of the radio and television (CCNR) for a few controversial declarations as regards the social work and on the Haitians, as well as for his rude language in the radio.
The CCNR thinks that mister Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express his opinion, but certain declarations were containing "inaccurate information about the social work, a representation unduly negative of the Haitians and rude language that should not be used in the emission spread during the day."
The Advice has indicated also that the debates on the suicide, including the publication of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not infringe the codes on the broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints as regards the comments done in emission spread between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was expressed after a complaint of the common Front of persons who receive social work of Quebec.
The group was complaining about that the quantities mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presenters must communicate trustworthy information and not that should drive to trick.
As regards the suicide, presented Stéphane Dupont had shown that the suicide was a cowardice act.
Most of the members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the transmitted message was that the suicide should not be considered to be a solution to the problems of the life.
"Most of the Committee are considered to be by that the raised doubts episodes of "Dupont him midi" they have treated a delicate topic of an equitable and suitable way."
Consequently, in this respect any fault has been rejected.
The last litigation was referring to the declarations realized after the earthquake of Haiti.
In that moment, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had led a clash mediático that had caused numerous reactions.
CHOI'S presenter declared that it had not realized any donation to help the Haitians because he could not know safely if the in need ones were going to receive really the money.
The Committee thinks that these comments are not excessive, but that his accumulative effect constitutes a representation unduly negative of the Haitians.
"I have already fulfilled my suspension of three days there above."
"My records are clean for one year and a half," the presenter declared.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the emission of rude language.
In any case, the radio channel CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more of the required thing."
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcasting station, which will have to, between other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of major hearing within a period of three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
The montrealés of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar trip.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, rises to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I began practising martial arts as the kung fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," told Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis from 2008 to advance in the professional level.
"In my case, I look for combats everywhere because, for whom they do not enjoy the game on the soil that the mixed martial arts imply, few competitions exist in North America."
The athlete, who works like safety agent and like employee of the company UPS, has given recently bad news to his rivals, gaining two golden medals in the Championship of the World amateur of World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), celebrated from October 23 until October 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the kickboxing full contact categories and of thai box," he told.
"At present I prepare myself to take part in the Cup of the World of san shou in China."
"They will invite the sportsmen who have ended between the first four positions in the last championship of the world in every category."
"In 2009, I gained the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth position, but I reached the third position in Toronto in 2009," it added.
"The interesting thing is that I have been progressing in every competition."
"To this step: I will be the first one this time or the next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is an original discipline of China in which it is allowed to beat with the handles and the feet, as well as to throw the adversaries to the soil.
The clashes originally are celebrated on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, extensively recognized in the world of the martial arts.
Although to Be born Zemmal just must support a competition in his career, undoubtedly it will come to the big tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the kung fu.
"This competition is the most well-known and prestigious of China," tells the nice boy.
"It is like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand) ."
"It has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has gained his first combat, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but it lost in the final.
"The one that has won me is a real professional," he thinks.
"There are four competitors for category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face in the final of his category."
"Next, the champions of every category face to crown to a champion only one, the king of the kung fu."
450 millions in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts for a value for 450 million dollars to companies of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the center of this avalanche of more than hundred contracts there is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous tender the most important contract, that of management of the project, for a sum of 295 millions.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 immediately after the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector his responsibility of managing this important hydroelectric project for 5.000 million dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Énergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender being realized previously.
For the Party quebequense, the resource to companies consortiums raises a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate the competition and provoke an increase of the prices.
"It is a question of a new collusion method and to eliminate the competition."
"Namely the people, instead of doing it secretly, now they do it openly," the deputy of the Party declared yesterday quebequense Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, mister Simard raised the question in the national Assembly because, as he affirms, it does not understand how it is possible to be of benefit to the public interest this way.
The Minister of Natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, answered in the evening, denying firmly that a collusion should have taken place with this contract.
"I begin getting tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had operated in a "dishonest" way and "with absence of rigor."
It pointed out that "the minimal thing" would be that the PQ was apologizing.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice in the entire world.
Normally, it is a question of an alliance with a temporary limit that allows to two or several companies to group his knowledge to answer to a tender for a complex project.
The project Eastmain presents a high complexity level, bearing in mind the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and they will last until 2012.
In the whole case, the contract has been granted without the competition entering game; it has been a question of a negotiation.
Also, the formula of the consortiums has stopped being the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Devoir was publishing last week Him, the formula of the consortiums in the sector of the technical advice is being submitted to an investigation in the Government.
A rapid glance to the mercantile record of Quebec allows to identify more than 200 consortiums, of which some of them seem permanent.
This way, the company Dessau is employed at association with most of his principal competitors, like TOP +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Every combination, and tens of them exist, he leads to the only legal person, that is to say, Dessau.
As for consortium Énergie gérance, the Minister Normandeau has emphasized that "the territory of the Bay James answers to a dynamics of particular labor and Hydro-Québec answers specially to her from the year 1970."
The big chief of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie of Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that he has emphasized the fact that the management contract of the project has been granted of direct form.
"If you answer to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the actors of the sector and say to them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"Nevertheless, the idea is that what it imports is not the price, but the competition of the persons," pointed out mister Laporte.
The contract granted to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50.000 dollars obtained by the Party quebequense.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After the cross-check, Devoir has identified 109 contracts of technical advice granted between the year 2002 and March, 2010 to companies or to his branches, in particular laboratories geotécnicos.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without bearing in mind his participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In whole, they amount to 449.783.344 dollars, including the contract of Énergie gérance for 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has given to understand that four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ also is linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before adding that it is a question rather of his leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption. The "green" tag does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer quebequense scarcely trusts in the actors of the sustainable development, as well as neither in the marks of just commerce nor in the ecological certificates to guide his elections.
According to the Barometer of the responsible consumption, which first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a universe mediático where they infest messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but he is sorry about the absence of trustworthy information and thinks that this one even brakes his commitment.
Even if there has increased the consumption of the socially responsible "called" products in 2010, the quebequenses seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that ecologists of the same ones trust neither in the environmental commitment of the companies nor in the publicity, it reveals the tool of measurement prepared by the Observatory of the consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called just, as well as the credibility of the products and marks that take tags indicating that they are "ecorresponsables," it points out the Barometer.
In the same way, only 14,6% of the quebequenses takes seriously the speeches of the politicians on this question.
In any case, the information about the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of the consumption, sustained at present by nearly one third of the consumers quebequenses.
In fact, the lagoons and the doubtful character of the information do that 46% of the consumers rejects this option.
It is a question of the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Also, a third of the quebequenses says to distrust also the supposed yields of the products or ecological services that one tries to sell to them.
On the other hand, practically half of the consumers changed his habits in 2010 and, especially, they changed the mark of one or more products to respect his convictions.
61% has given priority to the buys in the shops of his quarter and has preferred to buy food products cultivated in his region, points out the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the index of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec adores to fill the vacancy of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce his impact on the environment worrying for the protection of the fauna.
Nevertheless, according to the Barometer, this social conscience seems to be of doors (of his car) out: in 2010, only 28% of the quebequenses indicated that it should have used the public transport or they have shared car to defend his environmental beginning.
Also, 39,1% of the participants of this wide survey of behavior, which has just completed his first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and the displacements on foot.
A loan so that the State recovers eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which they have asked to compromise financially in the recovery of the complex of movies eXcentris pos Société Angus and the Parallèle, accepts to collaborate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société of développement Angus and the Parallèle, which were waiting for a donation for seven million dollars of the Department of Culture to buy to Daniel Langlois the complex cinematographic eXcentris again in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and were returning him his real movie buff vocation, have not obtained for what they were asking.
The Government has accepted to be involved in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the awaited donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which quantity would be, in fact, lower than the initial expectations; this one might constitute a viable solution in profitable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain civil servants.
Quebec had already pushed last spring back the first plan of action and a request of 12,8 millions, but since then the requests have been checked to the fall.
The president of the Société of développement give entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris records, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
He has sent a last report does a ten days.
Nevertheless, the SODEC received a counterproposal of the office on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have from term until December 31 to answer to the same one.
In any case, it seems that there must be rejected completely the hypothesis of a donation of the State.
Let's remember that the owners' Association of rooms of movies and cinematographic complexes of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to endorse the eXcentris recovery, arguing that the Department of Culture must not finance real estate projects, since it has not done it with other movies rooms.
On the other hand, diverse representatives of the sector yes claim a considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the proprietor of the same one, has taken for ten years the load of the author's movies in his places of the complex, after financing its own construction, what might justify an abolition on the part of the Council of the Treasure.
The absence of rooms for independent movies turns out to be clear in Montreal and eXcentris he had could make faithful to his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, impel for his part a financing campaign privately, hoping to assemble 700.000 dollars to open way to him towards the acquisition.
From spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, keeps on projecting movies in eXcentris.
The target of the future buyers is to re-open three rooms next February 27, projecting the beautiful movie of Xavier Beauvois "Give hommes et give dieux."
Nevertheless, Christian Yaccarini has not communicated with Him Devoir again and we do not know what there think it and his group of the proposals to the fall that they have received.
There gets up the veil of the Canada with a complex...
The new American diplomatic cables spread by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States consider to be the complex of the Canadians with regard to the Americans, but they reflect simultaneously the feeling of superiority of the above mentioned towards Canada.
The American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not think about the relations the Canada - United States when they are going to vote and believe that the visit of the president Obama has helped the conservative government to achieve that his budget was approved in 2009!
Four new communications between the American embassy of Ottawa and of Washington that have become public yesterday, offer rather juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is to say, during full federal electoral campaign, reports until point the United States do not enter the questions debated by the political leaders.
This provoked big surprise the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mister Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders turn out to be determined by a complex of inferiority practically inherent in the Canadians at the time of treating the daily domestic questions, instead of leaving such an election to the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988) ," he writes.
Consequently, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak about him."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because two countries support a few intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he thinks, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and, moreover, than the chief of a party to manage these essential relations it should be a key factor about which the electorate should think at the time of voting."
The cable one can observe this importance feeling also sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, to prepare the president Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help to guarantee the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by means of which Canada will register for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a plan of recovery of between 30.000 and 40.000 million dollars," writes mister Breese.
In no side one mentions that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent from replacing the coalition not that the opposition camps were determining his survival to the quality of the proposed plan of recovery.
Another communication of January, 2008 signed by ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington on the image more and more negative that there transmit the dramatic series spread in the CBC of the United States.
The ambassador is worried by the emission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in that there are realized slightly subtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the sequestrations so that the CIA realizes energetic examinations.
Another cable tells that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be ready to receive some prisoners of Guantanamo.
Mister Kouchner answered that yes, but that was depending "on every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "it has delivered a document to the State Department as regards Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary accepted to check the records."
Finally, we can mention that the fortitudes have warmed up as regards the place WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, ancient adviser very near to Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the person in charge of this massive escape should be "murdered."
In the United States echo of Mike Huckabee is done.
A world plan to renew the lighting
Yesterday, the UNO has proposed in Cancún a plan of renewal of the domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundred countries to reduce the gases of greenhouse effect (GEI) in a quantity that corresponds practically to a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan frames in the concrete set of big projects that the UNO hopes that it should be adopted in Cancún to compensate the absence of binding commitments of reduction in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which they still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced with bulbs fluocompactas or, even better, with diodes bulbs electroluminescentes (OF or "LED" in English), there would be avoided big part of 1.800 million tons (Gt) of GEI expressed in the planet to illuminate the human beings.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emission.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the emission of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the big issuing countries, like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, there committed themselves with a few reduction plans volunteers who had to diminish the global emission of GEI of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
Nevertheless, there should be diminished still 5 Gt of the above mentioned quantity to stabilize, before 2020, the increase of the temperatures in two degrees centigrade to avoid that descontrole.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy removes in the shape of heat and the rest, that is to say, 5%, produces light.
In case of the bulbs fluocompactas, the energy expense diminishes in 75% and with the new bulbs LED, the energy consumption diminishes still twice more.
The bulbs fluocompactas last an average of between 6.000 and 10.000 hours.
The new bulbs LED, like that the manufacturer Philips has thrown this week (a company that, also, has taken part in the study of the UNO), they possess a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, what allows us to do to us an idea of the saving that one can achieve with the replacement plan that it would be applied in hundred countries.
These new bulbs also can work with rheostats and express very little heat.
Superficially, they do not contain anything of mercury.
Diverse specialists have shown his reservations as regards the fluocompactas bulbs, since they contain mercury and that they must be eliminated like dangerous residues, which not always is possible in the developing countries, unless the manufacturers place instructions.
Nevertheless, it indicates the report, the principal source of emission of mercury in the planet there are no bulbs fluocompactas, but the coal thermal power stations, which express a big quantity of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted by the incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, the above mentioned head offices express 25.000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to every country.
For example, Indonesia would save this way billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is to say, the equivalent to 3,5 thermal power stations which construction would cost him 2.500 millions.
Côte d'Ivoire waits nervously for the announcement of the electoral results
The General Secretary of the UNO, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, since the fixed period have expired.
"The General Secretary emphasizes the need that the independent electoral commission should complete his work and should announce the provisional results immediately," there stands out a spokesman of the chief of the UNO.
"He asks to all the parties of Côte d'Ivoire and to the institutions them to demonstrate his sense of the responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until they announce the provisional results to themselves."
In spite of the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral commission it has left that spends the Wednesday deadline to midnight without the results being published, three days from the Sunday scrutiny.
About forty minute before the ending of the term, the president of the CEI had mentioned to the television that the commission "kept on working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday there have multiplied in the world the requests of which the CEI proclaims finally the name of the winner of the second return between projecting Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
Nevertheless, the edict of Gbagbo is provided with the annulment on the part of the constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in hands of the ancient rebellion of the new Forces (FN) from the frustrated coup d'état of September, 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, has affirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of the electorate realized by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the followers of the projecting president from going to vote.
The whole election might remain annulled if the constitutional Advice accepts the complaints presented by Gbagbo.
Now then, the Gbagbo adversaries think that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a near political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who denies any relation with the ancient rebels, has judged of "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but it has not gone that far how to claim the victory.
His Allied Forces affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that it has lost and that to present a complaint before the constitutional Advice after having prevented that the electoral commission the diffusion of the results, it would be illegal.
The second return of the presidential ones, on Sunday, must have put the morello cherry to the process of reunification and of conciliation of a country split into two for years.
The United Nations have warned on Wednesday to the political class of Côte d'Ivoire that they might be considered to be responsible for possible violence acts.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first return, on October 31, with 38% of the votes opposite to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, which received publicly the support of the ancient president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first return).
The unemployment valuation remains stable in France in the third trimester
According to the International organization of the Work (OIT), the unemployment valuation in France has stayed stable in 9,3% in continental territory (9,7% bearing in mind the overseas departments), as the Insee they indicate the information corrected with the seasonal changes released provisional (CVE) on Thursday for.
The number of stopped remains in 2.631.000 in continental France.
The information of the second trimester has been confirmed, 9,3% of the active population in continental territory and 9,7% with DOM.
In one year, the unemployment valuation has registered an increase of 0,1 points.
In general, 3,4 million persons in the metropolitan France were not employed at the third trimester, but they want to work, be or not available in two weeks for working and look or I do not use.
The situation of the present young people on the labor market has kept on deteriorating, with a new increase of the valuation of unemployment up to 24,2% in continental France (+0,9 points in three months, +0,5 points in one year), 25% including DOM.
During the third trimester, 637.000 young people of between 15 and 24 years was unemployed in the sense of the OIT.
For his part, a light increase of the unemployment has registered between the persons of advanced age, up to 6,4% in continental France (+0,2 points both in three months and in one year), that is to say, 482.000 persons of more than 50 years, number that promotes 6,6% with DOM.
Only a stability of the unemployment has registered between the persons of ages understood between 25 and 49 years, with 8,3% in continental France (-0,1 points in three months, +0,1 points in one year) and 8,8% in the whole France.
The Insee goes from 2006 without publishing the valuation of the monthly unemployment, after a polemic on his calculation methods.
Eurostat, the agency of statistics of the European Union, keeps on doing it and has announced on Tuesday a valuation of 9,8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9,9% in September.
Investigated and arrested Alexander Guérini
53-year-old Alexander Guérini, manager of companies of treatment of residues and brother of the president PS of the general Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, close to Aix-en-Provence, in the frame of an investigation on supposedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexander Guérini is being investigated by abuse of public goods, embezzlement of funds and government properties, concealment, active corruption, traffic of influences and possession of ammunition, as indicates his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is going to fight and he will answer to all the questions that the magistrate should raise to him, not bogeys."
"It turns out to be easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to demonstrate them," there had declared the AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the appearance of his client.
Mister Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit across his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain itself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and imprisoned also one of his nearby persons, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, mister Lucien Simon, the only thing that his client has done it has been to deal with the dumps that it must manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to his execution, he does not know anything on this matter, as says the attorney Simon.
In the frame of these records, there is being investigated also from Wednesday Daniel Pinna, ex-general manager of the services of the urban sprawl of Aubagne, for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but they have made him at large conditional and it has prohibited to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client could have explained all the facts that have reproached him."
"The instructing magistrate has born in mind the explanations and has left him at large," told his lawyer, mister Yann Arnoux.
The night from Tuesday until Wednesday they interrogated another four persons and left the freedom, under judicial control in case of two of them, as has indicated the attached district attorney of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, attached general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused by "traffic of influences and passive corruption."
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "theft and embezzlement of government properties by a person dedicated to the public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds," respectively.
Finally, the partner of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "concealment of the abuse of public goods."
Between the persons who have faced mister Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, imprisoned recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts that they were affecting to Corsica.
The investigators suspect that his societies there is service to whiten the capital of the big banditry.
The investigation is realized in the frame of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April, 2009 after the reception of a few anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the sector of the residues.
A source near to the investigation points out that the investigations concentrate especially on the conditions of allocation and functioning of a dump in The Ciotat, which gathers the Aubagne garbage, as well as of other cities of the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Matter Clotilde Reiss: the Elysian one has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, between July, 2009 and May, 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher stopped in Iran for "spying," has had in vilo the public in France, has been alert to the diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
Quite under the attentive look of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted I Peeled for Him they reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian one has explained his strategy to the Americans up to the point of giving them advices to manage their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
They show how the French persons in charge tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French did not produce to itself in exchange for the liberation of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian stopped in France and looked by the American justice for tráficos of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate to the mass media to give the idea of that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had redeemed an essential function in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it did not do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris takes the title "Iran: French comments about the way of managing the cases of capture of hostages."
The adviser of the Elysian one for strategic matters, François Richier accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for the north of Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, they converse with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise to the Americans to do the following thing to repatriate its own citizens retained by force in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "release continuously" in the mass media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
Everything to shame the Iranian, careful diet of his image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still."
Because, as soon as the attempts of negotiation were exhausted by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "expert in dilatory maneuvers."
Mister Richier adds that the foreigners' detention is "habitual Iranian tactics: the capture of hostages for the political blackmail."
He announces that the liberation of prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will take place on August 16, day in which it will shelter in the embassy of France) "will need the fertilizer from the Iranians of a big quantity of money" (230.000 euros of reward).
Also, it points out that the Elysian one anticipates other hostages crises, a phenomenon that "it is going to increase."
The Iranians might "in a next future to stop to other of them nearly 1.800 French citizens who live in Iran," he affirms.
On August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss goes out of prison after twelve days, but she remains blocked in Iran.
The following information spreads: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition they request the United States for illicit traffic of delicate electronic material towards Iran, has been set free in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which surrounds the Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release from prison of Majid Khakavand constitutes bad news.
Has an exchange accepted France?
To liberate the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not like that.
The Elysian one, he affirms, not only "it has been surprised enormously for the decision of the judge," but it has tried to be opposed to the same one.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the epoch, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision" judicial, is commented by him.
Mister Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand continues under the "narrow" alertness of the French information services.
The adviser of the Elysian one marks a telephone number, hangs and, later, he informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is at present in a few buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysian one does not spare effort in efforts, uses bulletins and "escapes" organized in the mass media to make to believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad redeems an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity with certain irony and verify that the manipulation brings his fruits, since several articles about press transmit the French official version.
A telegram with date of August 25, 2009 mentions "the 'blitz' mediático of the French officials."
To what does such a "gratitude" owe towards mister Assad, he wonders the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of his declarations full of praises, the French officials admit privately that only they have a vague idea of what the Syrians have done really."
Next, the document treats the reasons that have led the Elysian one to giving cause for this fiction.
The big communication effort "it takes as an object to validate the politics of Sarkozy of opening towards Syria," thinks.
A politics initiated in 2008, that "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, she had just been corrected of premature baby and desmerecida."
To "to exaggerate the Syrian role," Paris tries "to show to Syria the praises that he can harvest if it redeems a constructive role in the region."
The target also consists in "of sowing the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it about good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusts to him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyhow, they have been grateful for it."
"At least, this should provoke confusion between the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysian one.
In a bulletin, he is grateful to the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syrian that they have redeemed a "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
From midnight, the Korean young people cannot play in line
The Government surcoreano is going to adopt a called law "of Dogsbody" who will prevent the adolescents from taking part in games in line after the midnight blocking his access, as have indicated governmental persons in charge.
In December one will submit a law project to the Parliament to ask the companies of games in line to block the access to the above mentioned games after midnight to the young people of less than 16 years, as have indicated representatives of the Departments of Culture and of Family.
"Many children play the whole night and, later, it turns out to be difficult to study in the school and to take a normal life during the day to them."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect his health and his right to the sleep," there declared the AFP Jo Rin, ministerial person in charge in charge of the project of law.
The games in line will be again available at six o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have of one year to prepare themselves for the law enforcement, he adds.
The government considers to ask also the companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people like that request it, added the person in charge.
Also, it is going to put at the disposal of the one who requests it free computer programs that allow to limit the Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the newspapers give news regularly on diverse facts linked to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of the world competitions of games in line.
In November, South Korea obtained four golden medals in World Cyber Games, where it faced to another 58 countries.
World 2018-2022: the FIFA designates to the organizing countries
In the middle of the thunderstorm provoked by the suspicions of corruption, the executive board of the FIFA designates on Thursday to the organizing countries of the Cups of the world of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where the struggles of influence and the lobbying can go so far as to occupy first place on the technical criteria.
A thing is clear, the edition of 2018 of the competition of the FIFA will be celebrated in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain - Portugal and Countries Bajos-Bélgica).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or continue with his implantation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the chiefs of Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests that are in game in a World cup.
The deals behind the scenes, therefore, it is possible that they last up to the last minute.
Otherwise, it turns out to be difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of the FIFA, the candidacies Englishwoman, Hispanic - Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) possess better arguments than his competitors.
Nevertheless, these considerations will not have weight too much for 22 members of the executive board at the time of voting.
Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations who drove to the suspension for corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), it might have ruined this way the opportunities of his country, cradle of the soccer, which just received the World cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday on having spread a documentary that has shown up three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to dislike the FIFA and to shame the English persons in charge, who have thrown themselves an intense lobbying in the last weeks with David Cameron the head.
The Chief of Government hopes to re-edit the blow given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity: will it be sufficient to recover the sheen of England before the CE?
It is not clear, position that the duo Spain - Portugal counts also with numerous strong points thanks to his stadiums, already ready, his experience (World cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and his soccer culture.
Nevertheless, the shaded economic and financial perspectives of both countries might throw below his ambitions.
The possible countermeasures against the Englishmen and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing that they obtain is to give points to Russia turned into an outsider of weight in spite of the lagoons into his candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
Nevertheless, the Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided not to displace Zurick and it has denounced a "disloyal competition in the preparation of the voting," in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the CE.
"They are extracting to re-show his dirty rags, trying to compromise them," affirmed Putin.
For 2022, the United States, which have the experience of 1994, the most logical favorites seem.
The first world economic potency and head office of the principal sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to take him advantage to Japan and to South Korea, which they have developed separately an excellent project.
Nevertheless, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have organized together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the authorization of the World 2026 to China heartily wished by the FIFA, which would provoke that Asia will remain without possibilities for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented his project basing on futurist stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue with his expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, also might turn harmed by the weakness of the full rights of TV (according to the hourly difference) for the European countries, the spine of the war for the FIFA.
The second order: the test
Really he had doubted Gaulle.
Mitterrand had given to understand that he was doubting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not even the minor doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
An order in the Elysian one takes other.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
Nevertheless, the tests of it do not combine well with the mystery that usually collaborates to the presidential function.
Therefore, it is always necessary to feign that it is doubted.
Towards a side and towards other.
In 2006, although they should not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac were affirming that it was not discarding a third order.
On November 15, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy was indicating that it would take his decision "in some moment in autumn 2011."
Therefore, the fact that it treats with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Elysian one, the possibility of "two orders" has provoked certain fuss.
Is it a question of the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not much less.
The president just was indicating that the constitutional reform of 2008 was limiting to two the number of orders of five years.
Simply it was transmitting the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he speaks about the presidential ones, with a jocular tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you still will spend seven years and a half with me," it had released in July, 2009.
In another occasion, in May, 2010: "You do not think that I do not appear what will come later."
His affirmations of the day before yesterday do not bring him over any more to the candidacy, not less either.
They cause comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has raised to the forum what it takes to Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 turns out to be clear this is what it takes to many persons of the PS to claim that the battle is organized before the due thing.
On the other hand, the bad opinion polls.
For the first time, the right electorate prefers the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% opposite to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the topic," it has reacted immediately and prudently the environment of the Prime minister.
"If he thinks that it can lose, he will not be a candidate," thinks Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think that it can win," Alain Juppé resigned before the evidence corrects.
Euro: the BCE turns out to be forced to support his procurement of Letters of the State
The last meeting of the governors' Council of the European Central Bank (BCE) of the year should allow to need the forms of exit of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a big number of not conventional operations of monetary policy that they should finish at the end of year.
Because of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the institute of emission of Frankfurt undoubtedly one will not be able to be allowed to be so urgent if he does not want to risk aggravating a situation any more than complicated today on the European obligations markets.
The political cost would be equal of raised.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, has endorsed the active role redeemed by the BCE in favor of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the European States.
It has not meant if he was thinking that the central bank should do more, increasing for example his program of buy of state obligations.
"I save myself my opinion for my European partners...."
Eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Commission of Economic and Monetary Matters of the European Parliament, the president of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more eloquent as for his intentions, indicating only that the program of buy of Letters of the State on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we already will see what we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the BCE is going to support his principal invariable type in 1%, the lowest level of his history from May, 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of obligations of the Treasure on the part of the BCE has doubled last week up to reaching nearly 1.350 million euros.
Also, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, yesterday he would have bought again Irish and Portuguese qualifications.
In whole, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired qualifications for a quantity for 67.000 million euros from May, 2010.
Between the operators of the market, there is not doubted the most minimal thing of that they will continue the buys (consult the page 29).
The economists do not foresee no changes significantly with course either.
Although the loans operations to more than three months have already disappeared of the arsenal of the BCE, this one still realizes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and with durations that change between one week and three months.
The economists hope that today this device should extend for some months.
"I do not imagine that it is going to modify greatly his program."
"If not, it would run the risk of provoking new short-term tensions," thinks Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more probable that there takes place a progressive exit announced during the first trimester of 2011," there anticipates from his part Norbert Bräms, economist in Salt.
Oppenheim.
As regards the interventions in the market of the public debt, "the BCE should support a volume of buy of the above mentioned obligations so that the market stays stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Bearing in mind the importance of the exhibitions of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the area of the euro, the emission institute does not have any more option to support his presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price the investors' absence on the market and act in such a way that there prevents an increase marked with the yields paid by the most fragile States," was thinking yesterday an important obligations agent.
Because, if the interest rates put themselves for the clouds, the States will have even more problems to reduce his indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting to the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi gets over the storm
After Italy has begun the week of a worrying way, the situation improved lightly yesterday with the ebb of the types of the obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calmness.
To the exit of a meeting with the Secretary of the Treasury, the regional presidents have affirmed that they listened to Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation of "undecipherable" and that was waiting for an "unforeseeable" weekend, for declarations denied later by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term types they had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of coverage against the risk of failure (CRQ) had gone off up to 263 points, provoking a certain fuss in Rome.
In the Cabinet, Silvio Berlusconi mentioned that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was superior to 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was evident "deeply worried" for "the turbulencies on the markets" and for a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the area of the euro, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"La mala noticia es que es como Portugal," Irwin Stelzer explica, economista Instituto de Hudson en el-.
In fact, his problem is the absence of growth and the stagnation of the income associated with the same one, what it provokes that the State runs the risk of not being able to face to his needs for financing.
The last forecasts of Brussels have supposed a pitcher of cold water for the government.
It is anticipated that the Italian growth will reach 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012, while the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on a few numbers of 1,3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these circumstances, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4,3% of the GDP the next year (opposite to 3,9% foreseen by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Hence the rumor of which new budgetary dispositions could be applied after the holidays, for a quantity for 7.000 million euros.
"In necessary case, new austerity measurements will have to be adopted," thinks the Commissioner of Economic Matters, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is provided with the support of the international institutions.
"The bases of his economy are in order and his accounts in the good state, as we go saying for time," makes sure Arrigo Sadun, the Italian manager in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, not to shortly nor in the long term, because in spite of his considerable debt (119,2% of the GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts of stabilization requested Italy are minor that needed from other countries," mentions Pier Carlo Padoan, economist chief of the OCDE.
There stays the problem of the political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censoring motion in the House of Representatives, after which the elections might be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a slightly propitious period would be opened for the decision making in case of a serious crisis.
The Europeans reflect on the reinforcement of the mechanisms of struggle against the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, in the night and for the day, that the Europeans are clearly united, determined, compromised with the defense of his currency and of his monetary area."
Although it was relative, the relaxation registered yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has impelled the governments and the BCE.
Nevertheless, we cannot speak yet about a beginning of standardization.
The agency of qualification Standard and Poor's announced that it might lower the qualification of the debt of Portugal, the most frequent target at present of the speculations.
"As in May, political clarity and transparence is missing really, which weighs significantly on the bank systems," think the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political rhythm is much slower than the rhythm of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers that he hides, the European countries intensify the debates to reinforce the already existing mechanisms of exit of the crisis.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance who turn out to be more straight affected and, in general, with his counterparts of the G-20 they go for good way.
And this bearing in mind also the meetings of the Eurogroup and of the Ecofin at the beginning of the next week.
The BCE meets today.
In the agenda, the type of not conventional measurements of support to the countries of the area of the euro in the colimador of markets (I consulted more above).
As for the European Fund of Financial Stability (FEEF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, it has initiated on Tuesday in Singapore a trip for Asia to inform the investors of the Far East about the innovations of the crisis in Europe.
Although the target of these visits does not consist of collecting funds, undoubtedly it paves the way.
It is foreseen that the first emission of qualifications of the FEEF is realized next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative has entrusted to the agency Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase of the funds mobilized by means of an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
As for the countries that find in the first line, Portugal and Spain, these to prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organization of the labor market.
These reforms join the austerity measurements with a more nearby effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to advance for a way different from the one that Greece and Ireland continued.
Both want to avoid at all costs to request international help before applying its own budgetary corrections and before deciding the structural reforms that they consider to be indispensable to increase the confidence of lasting form.
The silent partners of the European funds, finally, raise the options available for accelerating the process of standardization of the markets of public obligations.
Of step along Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first one in throwing the idea of that, if 750.000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to extract the portfolio again.
The economists of Cardinal Barclays, an actor of the first line on the market of the European public debt, think that a quantity of about 100.000 million additional euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the shape of direct liquidity injection.
The instrument exists for it: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, provided at present with 60.000 million euros.
An advice that, undoubtedly, the European capitals might examine in detail.
Especially if they worsen the market conditions.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
The snowfalls keep on provoking circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect to diverse economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snowfalls and of formation of ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday until the noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, they joined the group in the night.
According to Météo France, the strong fallen snowfalls affect to the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also it snows lightly in Mauritius.
They wait for a few snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually of between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and of between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Low Normandy, Mauritius and Lemosín.
The snowfalls are sufficiently strong as to provoke circulation difficulties and to affect to some economic activities, alert Météo France.
In Côtes d'Armor, there is no admittance to several departmental highways to the heavy vehicles of more than 7,5 tons, including the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, for what they recommend not to behave except in case of need and it has prohibited itself the circulation of certain vehicles TER during the day.
During Thursday, the student transportation has been prohibited in Mischievousness.
No specific measurement had been foreseen on Wednesday night to limit the circulation of the heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all the drivers whom they lead with the biggest prudence in the highways and whom adapt his conduction to the situation."
The Headquarter of the civil aviation (DGAC) asked the air companies to annul on Thursday 25% of his flights in the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because of the due snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends to the air passengers to get in touch with his airline.
In Great Britain, the Gatwick airport, to the south of London, and that of Edinburgh, in Scotland, they are closed until Thursday morning.
Meter of the Grand Paris: the first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport in the Mauritius has reached his icy point, thousands of millions rain.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we speak about 23.000 millions for the meter of the Grand Paris that must construct Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds for 4.000 million euros.
In the theoretical plane, this sum will be the one that will allow later the SGP to obtain loans on the markets to finance a part of his double ringlet.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The finance law rectificativa of 2010, examined in the commission of finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices foreseen to find the first part of this money.
Two ways exist: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase of the tax on the offices in the Mauritius.
The first one, as we read in the article 15 of the text of the project of law, is "for the sake of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
Also, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second one is a modification of a tax on the offices that exists already "to modernize it, to increase his product and to destine the above mentioned increase to Société du Grand Paris."
How much would be obtained by this method?
Who knows.
In the text numbers do not happen.
But it is far from 4.000 millions.
"One adds that the fiscal resources are added to 4.000 million euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that will grant to Société du Grand Paris as I advanced the project," we can read in the explanatory preamble.
To the SGP he does not surprise this system.
"From the moment in which income is created (two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and later receive 4.000 millions later, as we tell."
"It will register in the budget and will be used according to the needs."
The SGP calculates that empecerá to receive 4.000 millions in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This device, in which 4.000 million fiancés do not appear in the credit, can provoke a parliamentary debate lightly burning.
The first public meeting will be December 7.
Avenging Hackers and diligent spies
The matter WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that just looks like a scandal before the hypocrisy that governs the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, he announces deep changes to international scale and foresees a future dominated by the retrogression.
But let's go step by step.
The first WikiLeaks aspect is the assertion of the fact of that every records created by a secret service (independently of the nation to which it belongs) are formed exclusively by press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual Berlusconi customs just reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those who belong to Berlusconi) and the profile sinisterly mocking of Khadafi takes a lot of time giving ideas to the artists of cabaret to create his sketches.
The norm according to which the secret records just must be formed by news about public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If he visits a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, it will see that every work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templarios or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not due only to the fact that the authors of texts ocultistas do not want to do unpublished investigations (or do not know where to look for innovations on the nonexistent thing), but because those who devote themselves to the occultism not just entrust in what they already know, what re-confirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same is applied to the secret records.
The informer is lazy, as it is lazy (or it has avidity small) the chief of the secret services (if it might not be, I what I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers to be true what he can recognize.
The information top secret on Berlusconi who was sending the American embassy of Rome to the Department of the State was the same that the Newsweek was publishing the previous week.
Then: why have they caused such a fuss the revelations of these records?
On the one hand, only they say what every person cultivated already knows, that is to say, that the embassies, at least from the Second World war and since the Chiefs of the States they can call or take the plane to meet to have dinner, have lost his diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, they have transformed in centers of spying.
Any spectator who sees investigation movies knows it perfectly, only we feign that we do not know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly infringes the hypocrisy duty and gives a bad image of the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea of that an any hacker could consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world affects greatly to the prestige of the Department of the State.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "executioners."
But let's enter the real nature from what it has gone on.
Formerly, in the epoch of Orwell, it might be conceived to all power as a Big Brother that it was controlling every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwell prediction it has become true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every realized deal, visited hotel, taken freeway, the citizen was turning this way into a finished victim of the eye of the power.
But when it is demonstrated, how it happens now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of the power can escape to the control of a hacker, the relation of control it stops being unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power keep back that can already preserve its own secrets?
It is true, as was already saying Georg Simmel, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret will never be able to be revealed); also it is true that all knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public ambience; but to reveal, as it has done WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take all power from him.
WikiLeaks has not done any damage to Sarkozy or to Merkel, but yes, and very much, to Clinton and to Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful potency?
It turns out to be clear that, in the future, the States will not be able already to put in the network any reserved information, since it would be like publishing it in a cartel in full street.
But also it turns out to be clear that, with the current technologies, it is not possible to hope to support confidential conversations by phone.
Nothing turns out to be easier that to discover if and when a Head of state has moved in plane and has got in touch with one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to support in the future private and confidential relations?
I know perfectly that, for the time being, my forecast is a science fiction thing and, therefore, fictional, but I imagine to governmental agents that move of discreet form in procedure with uncontrollable itineraries, taking messages that have been learned of memory or, as very much, hiding some information written in the heels of his shoes.
This information survives then, in the only copy, in drawers closed with key: after all, the attempt of spying of the Watergate was successful that WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that the technology at present advances like a crab, that is to say, backwards.
One century after the telegraph without cables has revolutionized the communications, Internet has created a telegraph again with (telephone) cables.
The (analogical) videotapes had allowed to the investigators of the movies to study a movie step by step, advancing and stepping back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the (digital) CDs just allow to advance or step back of chapter in chapter, that is to say, to enormous proportions.
With the trains of high speed, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in plane, with the displacements that it bears, we need three hours and a half.
Therefore, it is not at all out of the normal thing that the politics and the communication skills take us again to the carriages.
A last comment.
Formerly, the press was trying to comprise what was planned secretly in the embassies.
At present, there are the embassies those that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: the botched jobs of France in his financing promises
One year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time to examine if the financing promises have been respected quickly unblocked (calls fast start or precocious) realized by the developed country.
And the French botched jobs have been revealed.
In the Agreement of Copenhagen, the developed country promised to provide 30.000 million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised to contribute 7.200 million euros in three years and France 1.260 million euros (that is to say, 420 millions a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table his best letters to convince his associates in to that his commitment with the financings fast start is real: a report detailing the measurements of his Member states, a press conference, a big complementary event, the leaflets distribution...
The operation transparence turned out valuable and it was appreciated by what really it costs: the developing countries and the civil society would like that all the developed country was doing the same and at the same precision level.
The EU announces that it has liberated 2010 2.200 million euros, which places it in the good way towards the fulfillment of his commitment of 7.200 millions in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, the things are more complicated.
According to the Agreement of Copenhagen, the money must be "new and additional" to guarantee that a complementary effort is realized, without harming to the official help to the development.
Unfortunately, one has not come to an agreement on what it means "new and additionally."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonization, some Member states, including France, they have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that more is convenient for him.
For example, the European Commission has cited as an example the year 2009: the international financing is supported and 150 millions are added in three years by way of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references as for year or at the level of the official help to the development.
On the contrary, France thinks that the financing of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 they are "new and additional."
In other words, one alludes neither to the expenses of the previous years nor to the entire level of the official help to the development.
In particular, the entire quantity of the help of France to the developing countries can remain stable (or even to diminish), while he claims that he respects his commitment on the subject of "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the share-out between donations and loans.
Once again, no norm exists and everyone chooses the calculation method.
Some of them, like France, think that every given euro is equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the loans use can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emission that are based on more effective technologies), it turns out to be fallacious to present an euro that one is going to recover like equivalent to an euro that is donated... As very much, it would be necessary only to calculate for his commitments the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (that is to say, the equivalent to an interest rate).
Pero Francia does not find such a reasoning useful: he "respects" his commitment for 420 million euros doing 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8,5% of donations (36,1 million euros); consult the document of the EU to see it for its own eyes.
It is a question of the only country of the Union that uses so often the loan.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, between others, respect his commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union contribute an euro to fulfill his commitment, France just contributes ten cents and thinks that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in his financing fast start, France realizes a double abuse: on one hand, as regards the actions in the time and, for other, as regards the real financial effort.
Spending only 36,1 millions of euros, it manages to give the impression of which it spends 420 "new and additional" millions, as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Department of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, so much inside the EU (why were going other Member states to keep on being donated when they can be big enough simply?) as in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not dumb...
The chapter of the precocious financing is a trifle, relatively in the short term, as regards the set of the negotiations on the climate.
But it might be a grain of sand of more in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
Let's hope that it should not be like that.
Be what will be, it turns out to be indispensable to learn of this first year of precocious financings.
First of all, France might announce a change in his calculation method for the year 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting his commitments and in the same way that the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France might do that they were advancing the debates on the bets in game as regards the long-term financing (another essential chapter that is debated at present): we will escape neither from the question of the "additional character" nor from the method to calculate the loans.
France might change his position to become so progressive as regards this question as it it is with others.
Therefore, we have left the hope of the new Minister of Environment, missis Kosciusko-Morizet, that the next week will come to Cancún.
An announcement surprise on the fast start of France and on his vision of the "additional character" and of the use of the loans would help to improve the necessary level of international confidence to advance in the negotiations.
Warning on the pesticides consumed by the children
A 10-year-old child consumes in one 81st different chemical substances, as indicates a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the ancient movement for the rights and the respect of the future generations).
The association, which warns that his results "do not have a significant statistical value bearing in mind the limited analyzed number of samples, but they are illustrative of the problems treated," acquired in supermarkets of I Heard and Paris between July and September the food that there usually consumes a child of approximately ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fruits and fresh vegetables, three of dairy products and 1,5 liters of water a day), as well as the tidbits, were examined in the laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate turns out to be overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified ones as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified like sure carcinogens, as well as 37 substances capable of operating like agitators endocrinos (PE), according to the studies of diverse institutions as the international Center of investigation on the cancer.
"Although, in practically the totality of the cases, the legal limits do not excel themselves for each of the chemical substances of individual form, our study shows clearly that the exhibition of the consumers possibly carcinogenic and/or PE turns out to be worrying to pollutants," points out the association.
For the breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk they contain themselves more than one ten possible carcinogenic residues and three considered ones like sure carcinogens, as well as nearly one score of residues that they can harm to the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, foreseen like snack for the school, contains touches of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same is applied to the green Jewish women of Kenya, included in the meal, in which the study has detected touches of a powerful insecticide one prohibited in the EU.
Also, the Russian filet, the tinned and enclosed tuna the bar of bread or the chewing gum were prepared by pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the salmon track was "the" most "nourishing" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the analysis of the plate of plastic used to warm the meal in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "pollutants' cocktails" generate for the consumer "probably it is underestimated," he says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology They Verts (USA-LV) for his part, has proposed "opposite to the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the pesticides use to brake "the increase of the illnesses associated with the civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency of Food security (AESA) was indicating the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and the vegetable consumed in Europe, of which 76 in the cereals.
