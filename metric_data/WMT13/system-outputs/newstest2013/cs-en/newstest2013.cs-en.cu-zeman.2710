The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify its policy of necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan's center, however, such a hoax calls the myth that electoral fraud is less frequent than in the US, the number of people who die after lightning struck.
Republican lawyers, after all, for the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will erode part of America's democratic system.
Unlike Canada are in the US responsibility for organising the federal elections by individual states.
And it is in this spirit that most american governments since 2009, promulgated by the new laws, which make it difficult for the selection process, or to register on the electoral roll.
This phenomenon has ballooned after the elections in November 2010, during which had 675 new republican representatives in 26 countries.
As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 bills restrictive electoral law in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present identity card with a photograph and document the american citizenship.
These laws also restrict the period for elections in advance, override the right to register for the list of voters on election day and taking away the right to vote to citizens' entry in the register.
Before the elections in 2006 did not require voters to present půkazu identity with a photograph of any US state.
The first state that this requirement was introduced, Indiana.
The constitutionality of the law indianského confirmed in 2008, the US Supreme Court.
Republican offices, with the extension of this process, as well as other countries.
In the last two years to support proposals for such laws in 34 states, with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that, in contrast to the Quebec are not american citizens universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, half-11% of american citizens, i. e. the 21 million people aged to choose, no identity card with a photograph issued by the government of their country.
Also doesn't have an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the identity card, moreover, often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions will disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of african-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of people over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years, therefore, does not have the required identity card with a photograph.
And that is not all.
The students, who are as voters known for their conversion to democratic candidates in several states are not allowed to use their identity card with a photograph issued by the school.
On the other side of the same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who elect more republican candidates, cards issued by those clubs in the elections.
In 2004, did not require any state election proof of citizenship.
The first such a requirement introduced in Arizona.
From 2011, about a dozen states adopted laws that require voters to show that they are american citizens.
The measures aim to limit the number of votes from the hispanic community.
To note that two of the three hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011 to support in eight states laws that cancelling the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to write.
Those restrictions have its consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaign for the registration of voters to register some 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken in 2009 but caused a drop in when registering new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican legislators, then in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for the election in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were african-american, 33% of voters who voted in advance, although african american voters in this state was only 13%.
For Hispanics.
Accounted for only 11 percent of all voters, but 24% of people voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of the total electorate, were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Critics of the laws, which restrict the voter registration, is, of course, very strongly built democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors have blocked its veto several bills.
In order to suspend the controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.
They have managed to limit the damage, in part.
For example, laws requiring the identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.
The newly-introduced rules, however, quite definitely will make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics talk about bias approved laws and consider them to be a clear attempt to influence the outcome of the election in 2012 in key states.
The report from the Centre of Brennan's 2011 shows that in states where such laws are approved, 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes to the electoral system, will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already: this new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will erode part of America's democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: tests or not?
The dog was often incorrect test results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has contributed to the reluctance of men, who are already reluctant to test to come at all.
Let's investigate or not?
We asked the opinion of the two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States showed the high level of contamination between the groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time by a european, found different mortality rates among patients who undergo testing, and those who didn't.
The study also showed after 12letém apart, that those who don't have to be about 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
I therefore commend examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years ago, if your direct relative had had prostate cancer.
Men are also at risk of having an african-american origin.
The key is to make the correct decision, once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive forms of cancer and those species which are inert.
It is therefore necessary to explain to the patient's risk of cancer, offer a possible alternatives, not necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which is not in the long-term impact on life, and focus in these cases more on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, the number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer, if left untreated, because the type of cancer is aggressive and threatens them for life.
We propose to them instead of active surveillance, and, in the case of disease progression we offer them treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater precision, establishing criteria, which will help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not.
Still, I therefore recommend testing.
But it is important to have an interview with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to take a test or not.
In cooperation with international companies urologickou Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in connection with the dog.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there are no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
In spite of the progress made in the research seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease acceptance of the principle of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all the healthy eating and not moving, you could prevent up to 30 percent of cancer cases.
“If they stop smoking, this figure would be increased by at least 50 %,” underscores the Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer caused by inheritance.
Some percentage also remains totally unexplained.
For the canadian company for cancer research remains a priority in the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers is decreasing.
Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also risk factor for several more.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
“Today is in Quebec, 1.5 million smokers,” she says, shaking her head spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
The encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, decreasing the risk of dying of cancer by half.
Weight
Well, and obesity, according to the SCC another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
To increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, pancreas and uterus.
“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon,” says the report.
Nutrition
The organization also recommended limiting the consumption of red meat.
At too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is best to avoid and sausages, which are subject to the same thing.
The preservation of smoked meat, dried or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“May cause damage to cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer,” says the report.
Vitamins
In recent years, scientists have focused on the link between vitamínovými supplements and cancer.
Polls, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are according to the SCC contradictory.
Although one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, and other studies are on the increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is clearly shown.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists, as it is important to talk about their concerns and the precedent of families with their doctor.
“To undergo testing does not mean that you have cancer.”
The Higgs boson explored
Notification of a possible discovery of Higgs bosonu last summer caused an uproar.
There is a view that the bosons are involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
And there is also the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model-our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior — which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among physicists, however, still isn't 100 percent certainty that the Higgs boson goes on.
No doubt about it, is that we have a new particle, which is very similar to those Higgs bosonu as predicted a standard model.
New data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirmed, however, there are no more all the data, so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that the Higgs boson, as regards the risk of error is so small, and let's see what this is all about.
In this world is quite unambiguous Act, under which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be ignored — and not to try too hard, otherwise they will hurt.
Even if it is a very strange world of particle physics, it also shows that there is a similar law: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state” - the “state of emergency”, roughly speaking, creates some of their properties.
Particle physicists have further divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we can find good citizens, or fermiony, obediently follow Pauli principles.
And at the other end of the range, the mean-spirited bosony anarchists who are contemptuous of anything — certainly not this principle, which means that they may still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to equipment (by the way most exciting), which is the particle Adventure, in laboratories Berkeley mesony: here we go unnoticed, and “containment” particles, which are spreading the forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably not related in some way.
However, it should be said that these bosony aren't as exotic pets, as it would have been possible to believe.
If you read this article, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual truism: the photon, or “particle of light”, which is “a” electromagnetic force.
When the particles with electric charge faster or change its direction, “disturbed” that electromagnetic fields in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.
From this “distraction” is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than the photon-and thus one of bosonů, winners of the “power”.
A more stable field
It's also with the Higgs bosonem, except that “victory” is taken to other fields, the Higgs field, to make this a boson appeared.
The Higgs field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excited, it is necessary to achieve a very high energy levels, as with the frozen surface of a pond, has thrown a big rock.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as an accelerator at CERN laboratory-the Large Hadron Collider is friendly ties is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop that kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field with us again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
With the electromagnetic field respond, all of the particles, all of the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but not other-a piece of paper, for example, would never be on his own hold on the fridge.
And the same applies to the Higgs field respond all particles: those that do have some mass, while others (such as, for example, a photon, let us look at it) don't have it.
And Mrs. Smith asks why all this research is, “what will we?”
From the point of view of science to confirm the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to test any inconsistency between observations and predictions of SM.
Many physicists, moreover, are literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space “new physics” and to close some of the loopholes in the model.
It is the need to conclude that the model is still huge shortcomings, there's no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter again (oops!).
CERN facilities so far, though, such contradictions.
The response
Responses to these surveys in day-to-day life of Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Behold: at the beginning of the 1960s, were pioneers of the Bell Labs didn't know about the revolution, for their work to inspire.
Assuming scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I said the laser was initially regarded as a “toy in the lab.”
Imagine that.
And besides, the result may even from all the instruments, which surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during their works to the lens.
This sensor, though that Boyle initially didn't plan this, now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and has earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC we urgently need to change your life, but does that mean that no one really knows.
Palliative care-the best way to go through life … Le Devoir.
Through its Commission for dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in a delicate questions about the end of life.
The debate should soon to continue and, at the same time, about the bill.
In this crucial area have done a lot of work to do.
The magazine le Devoir tried to look at the issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks' Mr. L. still alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which was consuming him, gave him a two-year suspension.
“I was given five years of my life and it's been seven,” he says without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
“But it is still a shock for this, you can't prepare for,” he says.
The disease has done its work: extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself from the toilet or feed himself.
In looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees that will help him to get something to eat.
It is a bold and even smiles, talk to strangers who will be stopped, brings him drugs, offer a bath.
The courage of a death.
“My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, the shaming me,” she says.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his drug problem.
“In its life and learn that men's urine standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, an intolerable humiliation.
“It depends on the skills of the man's” whether the return will take, says psychologist.
In the view of many people who deal with palliative care, the crucial moments occur in the heart of a return.
Patients who are stepping into the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, everyone is suffering from cancer.
The forecast is for a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them, to provide so-called “therapeutic” care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear of suffocation die “fully conscious”.
The disease but to find their children.
“I've got good kids,” he adds.
“In my life I have no desire,” he says, and then says to her breathing apparatus.
Yet he still enjoys in the coming days on the last visit son of Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides the body with the help of nutrition.
It looks like a palliative care, which is, if you can no longer do anything else.
That death was more comfortable.
In Québeku strikes a bed palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
It is very little if we realise that we all have to die.
Here, life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martelová, one of the doctors in the home.
Whatever the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he or she may provide, for example, a sip of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics will no longer have to watch your blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening carrying beer Mr. X, who later died in the night.
This morning of his beer son in honor of his late father.
“We are helping patients as well as their families,” says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois' s days, one after the other, but the resemblance to each other.
In addition to the 93-year old man who enjoys from the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while připíjejí in his honor, dying tragically 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children after he tried all the options in order to survive.
“For the last six months, there is always a three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years,” says Dr. Christian Martelová with concern.
53% of patients in the home of Victor-Gadbois comes, here comes from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i. e. to care, which is intended to reduce the suffering, as soon as the sick, in the final stages of their lives, whether it's at home, in a hospital or nursing home.
And some organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montreal specialize more or less exclusively to the care given to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this lack of essential medical care in Quebec has led to a number of doctors specializing in palliative care fears the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, as evidenced by its opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martelové Quebec health system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all people to high-quality palliative care before it can agree to perform euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced patient who spent 14 days on standby in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.
Fears that patients ask about the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists care for patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative outlook.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce, Down with treatment, she said that she regrets that don't fight, tells us.
And he told me that it was over.
There is a powerful care
Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to your treating physicians, that their desire to fill them, as a team of palliative pussy eased the pain.
But it is to say that palliative care is not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to reliable Monereauové, director of palliative care at the company's domestic palliative care for the Grand Montreal, patients are defending the treatment of pain in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until death, whether by fits and starts, or whether he is a sedative administered on a permanent basis.
Unable to pretend that this part of the suffering we do not see eye to eye.
The patient, who don't get rid of the pain, will always have more opportunities to access paliativním sedation.
The sick, which is given a sedative, always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that's not always necessarily mean “I want to provide the euthanasia”, it means more to me, “I want to get rid of the pain.”

Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Administration officials, entrepreneurs in the construction and public works, lobbyists, political parties and experts on the italian Mafia still tell what they know about a “system”, which is a mixture of construction, state officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.
This “Scope” came from Quebec taxpayers dearly in particular between 1990 and 2000.
“It is interesting how the system crumbled since we take strong measures,” says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec parliamentarian and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to this scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts to build roads in Quebec, which then-liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest has approved only after long delays.
“Duchesneauova” report confirmed a direct link between industry, murky financing of parties and corruption of public officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010,” he says, “save a Ministry of Transport on procurement billion dollars,” when some people keep a tight rein on their instincts to get their share.
The Commission has already brought “Charbonneauova to resign two mayors,” he adds, with the hope that the country will be able to “uncover the subtlety of some people”.
A drive to combat corruption, based in 2011
A drive to combat corruption, based in 2011 is also involved in the fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
A police “Marteauovy company”, who since 2009, in order to ensure that the “cartel penězovodů significantly reduced inflation contracts…”
In recent weeks, carried out a series of searches and charges of fraud and corruption, many local councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a village on the outskirts of the city.
Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained the mechanism of the “system” of public contracts.
He gave during these years of 3% of the value of the contracts, which v Montréalu acquired a middleman, associated with the Mafia, which then transferring the money side of the union, which campaigned for Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after the year 2000, generous to all parties and has donated more than $88,000 canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) provincial parties, but especially the liberals, who were in power.
He admitted to arranging illegal source of funds for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
The contract with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal was a “system” of corruption.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, from the very detailed: over the course of a decade, it has received from construction companies, presents an invitation on trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and pocket money worth a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with penězovody which nadsazoval price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they have had to pay fees for about 30% to 40% overestimate invoices through false víceprací.
The organizer of the mayor's party Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of unabashed shutting his eyes to a parallel budget, which in its treasury was dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which put Montreal into large-scale crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými members who issued a warning signal.
As the Mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island since the year 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million promotérům right in the middle of the thriving trade in real estate.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be brought, he says, that “pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo culprits”.
The process is “painful, but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it is necessary to establish a v Montréalu own investigative unit and supervision to ensure that these dubious practices could return.
As if to tidy up.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials misappropriated by hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned, in particular the role of “members informed about this ruse”, as in the game-playing seriously!
Estimates that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with irony, adds: “I've heard that it's just a fact.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, but it will not resolve the situation: “until it is strictly limited election expenses, dirty money from politics will not disappear.”
Proposes a comprehensive monitoring system for the award of public contracts and financing parties: “which we don't fall can; if we look boldly on the substance of things, we can build again on more solid foundations and with more control and respect for the law.”
If this story defamed the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad Duchesneau recommends that all those who were laughing at him, to look at their own backyard.
“PSG is FC Barcelona!”
In this season's PSG put on a completely new tempo.
How to explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all of the individuals went to yourself, or an entirely new dimension of PSG.
They came to us with the big players.
Every day, in addition to getting them further.
The technical team has helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts make it possible to raise the level of the game.
And in games, it's not that easy.
In football, it's all very quickly.
But don't lose your head.
Since my beginnings in college in INF Clairefontaine until after a stopover in Saint-Etienne, I have always been shifted to different degrees.
Taking advantage of a competitive environment, which were introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
Reinforcements from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me have more flavor into the game and wants to bring maximum power.
And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the final say in the nick of time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all of technicians.
Today's 1. League peers and are among Europe's best coaches.
He has vast experience and with top teams won a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
According to me in Paris to win more titles.
In January, I had a conversation with him.
I had a number of injuries.
Trust me, it provides another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the season, PSG?
1. the league's Lyon took the leading position.
But staying in tow.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: very easily, we climb into a he.
What is your club in this competition?
We are going to try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be for a good european teams are tough customers.
First of all, we want to win their qualifying group against Porto, so we could play in retaliation he at home.
Can the PSG stand in the short-term, a major european club?
The budget for it.
That Paris has become a major european club must win titles and go down in history.
Today, this is not the case.
On the financial side, PSG means that this project could take place.
And it would be a big setback in nezvítězit 1. as in the league last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year I really want to win a league title.
In last season's still missing.
In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We picked 79 points.
It is usually the case that with 79 points are clear master.
But there is another club, Montpellier, had the season even more amazing.
I think that this year's lead.
Although the title to big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think, that we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG are expecting too much?
It is not unusual to expect from us a lot, considering what's invested and what our players.
It is receiving.
It is a fact that when he beat Troyes 4-0, and still find something in our newspapers complain, so it is not very pleasant.
One wonders what you people still can't ask for more.
Clearly, winning 4-0 on every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we demonstrated that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who had already qualified for the second season, and yet he also invested huge sums.
Given the sums invested might be expected to be in front of the other 15 points ahead.
The names of other clubs and the french league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, in last year's season very subtle, with new PSG moved into the next phase.
It shows how the League 1. amazing.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is a good thing that says that there is a “dependency on Zlatanovi”.
This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful and that gives a lot of goals.
Because of that came here and shows that it is the star of 1. League.
Wherever they went, he demonstrated that he is a big player, a global star.
In our team, we respect the person and player.
He also respects the people around him.
What has been achieved, it is truly exceptional.
This led the other to raise their own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows other side-by-side growth.
As you have experienced the Euro 2012 with France's entertainment?
As a disappointment.
I don't want to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury I couldn't play as well as I had imagined.
But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.
Today I was doing in representation play good matches.
And that's what I was hoping for from his team.
We have learned our lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and today, we owe it to ourselves, to our performance has been exemplary.
How do you see the first month Didier Deschampse led the national team?
Speaking on behalf of his results.
In qualification for MS are in a good place.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can sell for victory.
That was even Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to be compared.
Blanc has achieved its objectives that we have qualified for the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps leading our team in Brazil.
It is a draw (1: 1) of 16 October in Spain a solid baseline game?
This game has added confidence.
We have all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain was in his career before this game.
Thanks to Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks
All the negative effects of the current financial transactions based on central banks, and the cost of processing transactions identified among the beneficiaries.
As it is in the context of these technologies often true, there is a feeling here the political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies that leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor's Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual money (but not transferable to dollars, euros, etc.), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar BitTorrentu, which allows the exchange of files between two pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers connected to the network have already been registered around 200,000 transactions.
About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
The course bitcoinu first reached peak 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, about five months later fell to $2, today it is on the verge of about 10 dollars (overview of the courses can be found on page bitcoincharts. com).
In comparison with the World in exchange for real money or financial products that isn't impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) for the interest in its report on the virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to as “the most successful virtual money”, “competing with the dollar and the euro” and “the equivalent of current money”.
Bitcoin from other types of virtual money differs in that it is the “credits” to be used for the procedure in a video game, which gets in the game or that they can buy (and sometimes even back change).
Social networking site Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, but the central government controls and processes the communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu nodes of the network are all the book's current accounts, supervisors, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How it works?
Each transaction between two users are actually between two electronic addresses via e-mail.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.
The network so it can verify the transactions.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key lies in this new phase of the transaction in this book.
There is help solve mathematical task the computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the stage of cutting up the file; i. e. the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital fingerprint.
The computer “take over” the new transaction and added to her number, then the whole “cut”.
The goal is to find a number that provides specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number will find other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then unremittingly displays linked to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have to change his fingerprints.
If a user wanted in order to commit fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions — the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer that challenge would win 50 bitcoinů.
In order to avoid inflation, shared this reward regularly two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is such a limited number of 21 million, however, they can divide up the part in nine hundred million, so the room for margin here is …
The difficulty of the job also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and there has been an estrangement between imposed bitcoinů.
“Exploited a flaw does not concern itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, company payments for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering from this anonymous service.
But the problem is also true for cash.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like WordPress blogging platform is adopted.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizmannova Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book's current accounts, and showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů circulation.
In November, introduced “huge discounts.”
“Thirty thousand dollars have changed,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged in converting bitcoinů into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books relating to these funds, has a great deal of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu pay phone, but uses a system for verifying Bitcoin transactions, which are due to cheaper.
In addition, manages the winner of their identity and so can remain anonymous.
The system is easily sets for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Enough to address that can be called “ofotografovat and recognize,” explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to a more horizontal systems.
“Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive,” predicts.
The ECB, in its report, moreover, it implies a re-evaluation of the various risks, which are now considered to be increased, if this kind of money will be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and american troops should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army took control of its territory and that the Afghans have chosen their own futures and waiting for all of us.
Most of the injuries suffered by the people of Afghanistan's countryside, which we were punished because we consider them terrorists.
And we also, but we lost 88 killed soldiers, and all those injured and maimed.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who fled to Pakistan, but often the peasants, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as in soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even when he joined the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Now experiencing tolerance and frequent local support for insurgents, but if western forces to withdraw their support for the fall.
The departure of french troops from bases of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of mountains posázených mandloněmi thanks to french loans, orderly.
A convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without an aerial attack by helicopters.
Since the end of 2014 already in Kabul will not be talibánci so active.
From their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
Their take control of the country was regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans have paid a price for the obscurantism of the peasants, who completely dominated the organization Al-Ká'ida, their situation is, however, in our time has not improved.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci agree in an attempt to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became hustlers, seized by the state-owned land, which they sell as building sites for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and use the huge american contracts for sub-contractors.
The discredited; most of them, moreover, has never been in combat.
From what I heard in the campaign, the people's desire for a government that would not constitute the thieves.
Many young people want to go so as to leave those who were able to take advantage of american generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are already tired of war, and with it the ideology.
During his exile in Iran or in Pakistan knew of the modern world and its benefits to be had.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul currently live in 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full of girls as well as boys, go there.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they no longer want to go back to the previous parties nor the obscurantism of corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones; and the turkish tv series, which shows the modern world, are everywhere.
The army is already present.
The authorities will be challenging to her forehead, considered to be legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the soviet army already renewing provincial militias that are beyond the control of the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should should look forward to a certain degree of decentralisation, along the lines of the western states, but the US had wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so we have to abolish the post of prime minister, which existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai doesn't want foreign control, especially when elections are planned for April 2014.
The country, however, is from the 1950's and early years heavily reliant on foreign aid.
No industry was unable to recover, no dam doesn't work, there is no fundamental repair irrigation system.
Everything is imported; nothing to produce, fruit and vegetables.
Preference is a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would be necessary government control infrastructure.
Rumors flew that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that's just fueling the feeling that western countries were only to be seized.
Without the energy to process iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no mineral extraction can take place.
The Chinese are already almost abandoned a copper mine Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area to keep their role as the biggest employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is responsible for a large part of the imports and exports to resume normal relations.
The departure of french combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement assumes the continuation of current types of assistance: girls and boys' Lyceum, a professor of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, supporting archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative was “winning the hearts and minds” of the difficult task of trying to bring aid and military activities, which then caused the service “civil-military actions” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but it has already achieved thanks to a small french non-governmental organisation of a number of achievements in the areas of common interest and steps for agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which are involved in the number of local workers, have helped to dampen the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, trees, fruit trees, soil conservation and expansion of arable land.
What memory for him to leave after two billion euros of military spending?
A more modest budget would contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2,000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
These farmers are freed from the uprising led by foreign groups, they want in their words to reach a civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
Difficult to work on the egyptian constitution
President Mohammad Mursí turned to another game of poker.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided over the declaration of the Constitution, which grants him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the views of all the others that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final version.
Less than a week ago by the head of state to this assembly for the next two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt uses a text, which had been completed, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to legal controversies.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the division of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition the president persists in its “autocratic delirium” remains a “breach of its word” and “tramples on the right”.
His followers, however, to assure themselves that this is a way of quickly turn with the constitutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.
In two weeks' time, there should be a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood's intention to withdraw from the Egyptians to clarify the text of the article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain the national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country being rocked by protests.
As confirmed by in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians to vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the egyptian people before the ultimatum: “either approve my text, or keep the unlimited powers”, which otherwise would have come to an end after the adoption of a new constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large majority, approved the text of the Islamists.
Most liberals during the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the Constitution, slamming the door, with the result that they have the opportunity to promote their views.
Human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities in their step followed suit.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning, quickly followed by 11 people from the ranks of the reserve.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often passed unanimously.
Commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes is the day revolved around an hour for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the view that an hour in the conference room are not properly adjusted.
The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of the limelight, Article 2, remains at the end of the day, identical to the version of the 1971 constitution, stipulates that “the principles of sharia law is the main source of law”.
The Salafi party, for which it is the introduction of islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoping to replace the term “principles” with “rules”, which would allow more stringent application.
For the Islamists, the fact that it had not been repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy”, say the liberals, who sees this as a problem.
According to them, namely the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.
Focusing in particular on article 220, which confers on the University of al-Azhar advisory role, especially on issues of monitoring compliance with the laws of sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové is a disturbing, because “persons called the comments are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this as the beginnings of a theocracy.”
Liberals fear even more stirring up the fact that the next president of universities should be less moderate than the current one.
“For the moment, there was no specific religious implication.
With the Constitution remains Egypt in general terms the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university researchers, many of them studied in french schools,” says concerns Alexis Blouet, who is preparing to work on a constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, agrees that “there may be differences in the interpretation of Article 220, because in the words used belonging to religious terminology.
There is, in particular, a reference to the “fiqh” [islamic jurisprudence, while].
And in the future it may occur, the question of to what extent they are civilian judges responsible for the chance to express themselves”.
Yesterday approved the text is in addition to religious sites very criticized because of the enhanced powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in their relative to the former regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred by the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army will verify the defence budget to Parliament, but the National Defense Council.
Then, in military courts prohibited procedure with civilians, as requested by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations are talking in connection with the text that they think it is directed against the freedom of its misgivings.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the offense is still banned, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
No article is also involved in the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point of the ban on torture, referred to in Article 36.
This word was mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the egyptian president had last night to take part in a televised speech, to this afternoon's planned rally.
Supporters of the head of state will demonstrate on Saturday.

“The great and powerful” it announces in Moscow: immigrants would save money on language
While members of parliament and human rights defenders are still debating the law on mandatory testing, in the country's already discovered fraudsters who sell “counterfeit” certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other russian cities comes every year, 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, entered into the effectiveness of the law, under which each migrant workers will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
FSM, however, promises that, over time, the tests will be compulsory for all visitors.
The tests, however, will be composed not only of language skills, but also of Russia's history and of the law.
Knowledge of the language, it will also be necessary to confirm and extend to obtain a work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
The law does not apply to people who have successfully managed to reach the attestation and obtain academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits of conviction and the protection of the rights of the
The network test sites will operate under the auspices of the poet Institute of the russian language, the University of friendship between peoples, the Moscow State University, State University in St. Petersburg and other russian universities.
Migrants can pass tests in all cities; it is already in Russia to more than 160 such centres.
The initiative to promote the introduction of testing, supported by members of the State Duma and the FSM (federal migration service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders are often put in the press question: and what it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors?
So, in particular-are representatives of the migration service-this will make it possible to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of the “slave labor.”
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, says the chairman of the board of directors of Russia's Viktor Sebelev FSM in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
The only organized recruitment system will enable from 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in emigrants without occupation, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language, he says, with the conviction of Sebelev-is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with bad people who, under the pretext of helping ensure “order” to the ghastly, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, languish for months without food and documents and to work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.
“In their own country they are promising one, but upon arrival is false, confiscate their passports, paid the promised wages,” says Chief of the Tajik government labour migration of MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't scold!
The less that many citizens of the central asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only don't know the language of the country in which they want to get to, but they don't have the experience or even with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, rather like a disaster: only a very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the kids, not to mention the fact that it should be a nice dress, and fit into the school.
As children grow into adulthood, must be the first chance for work.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to admit.
“Do you feel humiliated and degraded.”
It is true that with regard to the language tests indicate human rights defenders in one important thing.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If they have not, and will not pass exams or receive no further official work.
In the meantime, the greatest number of migrant workers as well as before in Russia illegally.
“Welcome, or unauthorized entry prohibited”
Many of the immigrant workers argue that to have official status in our country is not easy.
The reason-bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization of costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But with false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the russian police know that we are essentially false documents, without registering, and there are cases of blackmail.
“Require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea,” - he shared with the press about her experience as a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
“Well, don't be stingy, buy a painting.”
On the first day of the validity of the law on the language, it was discovered that false documents are not only migrants for registration.
Employees of FSM have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of language tests.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners won't be free: each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with tests, paid the price for this document seven thousand rubles.
It is two and a half times higher than their official test: it will cost migrants three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future, is to safeguard the system against corruption that workers could simply buy documents, in that match, government officials and human rights activists.
Government authorities have so far may promise to foreign workers, who can't make up the first tests, needed time to have completed a course in the russian language.
For visitors who can't Russian, is expected to work in areas where it does not require active negotiations with the people.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into the circulation of illegal arms market
Share of crime victims with the use of legally-held weapons is very low
The MVD Russia submit a proposal to toughen the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It's reaction by government authorities on recent events: the cases were shooting at weddings, which is dispensed with the victims, and the massacre of ready Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradovem, resulting in the deaths of seven people.
The police wants to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age at which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma's committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised to change the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the russian authorities are trying to cope with the problem of the “tightening the screws”.
In an open letter to the network appeared, whose authors-representatives of various social organisations, are demanding the refusal “absurd” a tightening of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism and registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and he put it in an interview with the russian offices of the BBC.
According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior was for six months of the year 2012 committed 142 crime victims from the use of firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while over the same period was committed a total of 1168 thousands of crime victims.
The authors of an open letter, they believe, to tighten legislation in the area of civilian weapons to make the crossing on the “black market”.
According to their words are currently found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of Interior says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under scrutiny.
Suppliers: from the plant after officers
“Black” market for weapons is supplied by a number of channels.
The main channels is five, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for a decade in the workplace of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot sites that receive orders weapons
The first of them, “the army or military route”, that is to say the weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons stolen from the russian officers and kavkazané themselves,” says Baraněc.
The other type of “black” weapons are weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes the theft of police depots and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement agencies in criminal proceedings.
The illegal “mainly” comes into the sale of military depots.
In many military stores often leads to explosions.
“There is evidence that some of the fires were deliberately built-in order to cover a shortage,” says a former soldier.
His contribution to bring in the words of Barance and arms manufacturers.
“Currently impose private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and decommission weapons, which supplies on the black market, including Moscow,” says the expert.
Another source of “black” market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“That's where their production, sometimes there is weapons produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which organised their smooth production,” explains the former soldier.
Where is the gun?
Experts count, which is the approximate percentage of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons in the “black market”.
A report on this issue is handled in 2011 Center analysis of the problems and the design of public administration.
Experts analyzed the records of the Ministry of the Interior and the Bureau of Statistics, kriminologickou russian literature and data from public data portals, focusing on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers, from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons found on the black market “because officials, whose work is associated with weapons,” says the report.
According to the data, which are available to researchers, is 17% of weapons from armed conflict, in 14 percent of the cases occurred in theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is “black archaeology.”
The salesman-consultant to one of the weapons, which asked to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the “black sites” archaeologists long ago nobody buys — are simply too old.
More often than not, he says, the sellers rides for new shipments directly into military depots.
Despite the Ensign clients buy unit, for example, the TT.
For him, the use of a weapon, and he'll sell it over the fence.
“That would take her to the city and it sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines,” she says.
“The truth is that the police are well on track, and that is why, whenever they start burning plan in the detection rate for crime victims, made the purchase for traders with illegal weapons,” says consultant.
“Like in a shop.”
The seller, the buyer typically found each other through their friends.
I visited Web sites and blogs, while fellow, who gave me a chance to go on a platform of “test”, where the man who had led me to “corner”, where we were.
The price of mainly I learned there
Military correspondent Victor Baraněc
I want to obtain a weapon, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, tells the salesman-adviser. - a familiar, but I fully trust him.
Sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, “from Mr Ivan Ivanov, who asked me to tell her daughter lost a tooth.”
And now I get there over a man, which I'm sure.
He also says it is only me, because he knows that I inform against him.
Beginners looking for weapons in a variety of ways.
The former soldier Victor Baraněc was trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when the working paper for publication on the subject.
Patterns are, in his words, has not changed.
They gave him a photo album, where it was “all of what you think”.
“I felt like in a shop,” says the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke-everything you can try.
I, a potential client, simply buy-let's go with the seller in the woods and that we build a target.
“Give me a chance to shoot, and when I became convinced that the gun shooting well, we are beginning to negotiate,” describes the referee.
The magazine on the couch
The search engine on the Internet will bring you to Web pages and groups to “Vkontaktu”, where he offers to purchase the weapons “for various purposes”.
There are no documents or face-to-face meeting.
“You have a fixed amount of money,” says the headline in the advertising on the website “to buy a gun or machine”.
In these pages users leave their notice and ask questions.
And the sale of a minor?
“Of course, that without a licence,” asks the user “Ivan” (the spelling is preserved).
“I'll buy TT. Moscow” - briefly worded request “Fedorenkov.”
The Federal Security Service recently threw out the vast network of dummy Web sites and people who want to buy a military weapon, acquiring a shovel.
People are flocking to the hungry fish for bait and then extract coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military official Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes: Web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of Russia's laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will pay over the automatic teller machines.
“In response to this, the seller sends his photograph and description of the guidelines where there is a hidden weapon,” said a spokesman for the non-governmental organisation “law of the gun” Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baraněc confirms that after entering the order on the website can remain unarmed, and wind up behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently threw out the vast network of dummy Web sites and people who want to buy a military weapon, acquiring a shovel.
“People are flocking to the hungry fish for bait and then extract coal in Siberia,” confirms.
Makarov per 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms pay according to experts estimate the amount usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova from non-governmental organisations (NGOS) “the right to get a gun” his Makarov pistol for $100 - $300.
You have to wait a month to one-and-a - half months.
The weapon is shipped from warehouses for long-term storage depots, through the middle section.
According to the official statistical office declined compared with the January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion explained arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices have decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, the workers are on strike and supermarkets fastfoodů
Work on the premises “McDonald” goes up to a quarter of all american teenagers
In the past few days in America raised a wave of protests against low wages in the company's malls and Wal-Mart in restaurants popular fast food chains, such as the “McDonald's”, “Burger King”, “back Bell”, “Wendy's” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken.”
So far, no one can predict whether this wave into a wave of nine, or whether it is doomed to disappear soon.
This whole share support trade unions and many left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest ​platů receiving rank-and-file workers in Walmart and systems of fast food, is the aim of the organisers of the protests to achieve in their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector virtually intact for the labor movement.
46 cents per year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called “Black Friday” when America struck an orgy of low-priced sales by millions of people and, in some cases, was accompanied by the brawls.
On this day, some workers the company Wal-Mart, in which around the world working to 2.2 million people abandoned their work and demonstrate together with trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals supermarket chains, whose goods are addressed to the people of the lower and middle classes.
Wal-Mart sold throughout the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are, on average, about 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
For this reason, many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only in his work.
The availability of a range of goods made from a chain of Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics, he can afford to sell goods cheaply and Walmart, partly because few pay their staff.
They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic trucks or hand-held scanners.
The demonstrators on “Black Friday” demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the costs of the health insurance provided by the companies have risen sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Wal-Mart worker receives 9.5 dollars per hour, but it does not correspond to the level of spending, say officials.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage of about $12 per hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion dollars per year.
It's in an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company moves Walmart wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, will be a visit to a state only about 46 cents more.
For the year as a whole, consumers spend approximately 39 dollars more than today.
Wal-Mart's defenders point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
“Black Friday” in the company's stores lasted from 8 p. m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time the company Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Treasury made in “Black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.
Company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was only “other media sensation”, organised by the trade unions.
“Treasury vacant!”
Protests continued this week in New York, where their aims were trading houses Walmart (those in the progressive city are not too fond of, and therefore there are scarcely), but “McDonald” and cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that sells billions of portions, and then you don't pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal law and the laws of the State of New York, $7.25 per hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and on average, their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this expensive city, no-one can have lower wages.
Well, I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
Employment in the “McDonald's” goes through nearly a quarter of american teenagers who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.
Few people in that as their main source of livelihood or plans to stay there for a long time.
Currently, constantly in conversation with the staff of the “McDonald's” who complain that they have to live on that money, and some of them even to feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum on the Wall Street Journal's comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday for “McDonald's” at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the Treasury and cooks in fast-food companies started to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
Also demanded that in the realm of fast-food were established trade unions.
America's laws forbid the administration to defend the formation of trade unions and to punish the activists of the trade union movement irritations and layoffs.
On the other side of their management rarely makes life easier.
A fast-food businesses, trade unions, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high staff turnover.
Opposition
In this day of noisy protests also took place in a number of other low-priced Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the Assembly for “McDonald's” near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council, Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald's” says that sells billions of portions, and then you don't pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work!”
The demonstrators have seen their support as well as other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill, who said that “we need to act together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair remuneration for their work and economic prosperity, it deserves every New Yorker!”
As he described the newspaper's New York Times, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of America's sphere of fast food.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, although not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event happens to be the spark that ignited the flame of a mass movement, is as yet unclear.
“We are doing brain deceive average”
Among fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; recently, it means, in particular, view the world through the prism of the special glasses.
At the beginning of the year at its annual conference gave Google a working model of this news, and in November, it was announced that the application for the patent has also submitted a Microsoft.
In an interview with the leader of a group of interactive 3d technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that for scientists, this company's glasses are already a thing of the past.
Tempts them the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in general terms, what does your research group?
- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
The human race hasn't stuck in stage work with pixels on a flat screen, the best ever touching the screen with his finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, console and Xbox Kinect sensor-this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility through gestures.
- What is ahead of us in the future?
— Not to mention that the Kinect system brought the interaction at the physical level, very much interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3d.
The flow of information to improve the system takes a lot of data), but so far no flow of output.
We are trying to change that, we are working on a real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.
It is necessary to allow the computer world into our physical world, make it more realistic.
To this end, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in much better form.
And in the first place — to hell with those silly hats, virtual reality.
- What do you think of vocal control?
It's a popular thing, but not exaggerate?
Of course, it cannot be regarded as a panacea-raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for control of the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not the only one of such skoupých, short.
Gestures would nesnímala camera equipment, but a bracelet to monitor the movements of the bone and muscle.
So far, there is a big but, in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, that future is the type of control, such as a gesture of + voice.
— And how?
How, for example, ask me to give you the can of soda?
You say it, and at the same time show.
I usually just talking.
Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.
So you want to get users to adapt to what at the moment can or cannot machine?
- It is not necessary, but it's a mutual affair.
I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which can identify more precisely the reaction in humans.
It may be, for example, laser scanners, which provide relatively good in-depth resolution, that is very important.
If you have to talk about their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on modern cameras?
There is now sufficient detail, depth or something else?
In essence, the current generation — that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the three-dimensional detection.
Of course, it would be a good idea to raise 8 mega-pixels at a rate of 1,000 f / sec.
But it's not just about megapixels, but like a nut and depth.
While looking at issue are all current technologies for us non-trouble designers algorithms.
So we have to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y, but also from.
So it is also vital that speed, the number of frames per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratories in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 milliseconds, while current, mass-produced scanners are closer to the other value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands, to what extent it affects the interaction of man and machine.
For me, it was a very useful work in the equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need as many touches, but I need some pictures per second.
- And an increase in the number of cameras is necessary?
- In system Kinect are now used three “camera”, one of which is, in fact, an infrared transmitter and a second-set the reflected signal.
And already the third camera-that is, in fact, a sensor visible band.
That is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem.
Or worse, because it would increase the necessary volume performed calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.
If I remember right, Microsoft (unlike Google) presented publicly his glasses.
Don't you think that, when it comes to day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, walk and constantly keep smatphone in his raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be “portable” form of the extension of reality, where it would be possible on the basis of the platform, the clouds move at any time from his glasses on smart phones, the projection screen and around.
Glasses-it is a very personal device, it is their strength (private things you only see you), and, at the same time, it may also be a weakness-augmented reality on the basis of spectacles will allow you to work on a virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that tampering with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in “Iron Man,” but also ordinary mortal.
There is one issue on which critics often point: there is no tactile feedback.
His hand feels nothing!
What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
In his lectures often say that augmented reality-it is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of sensation, he could become the eighth spot.
So far, is one of the more interesting tricks-the use of second-hand as a kind of background for display.
An excellent way of recording the depression.
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding the appearance of solidity to these “images in the air” — for example, when a few directional ultrasound beams in the defined point the finger, causing tactile sense, but it is still very weak as if he was at his fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in his fingers-also a promising direction.
If you're trying to fool the brain?
To think, to feel what it appears that should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.
There appears to be yet another challenge, which I will fight long-how to make a man who is physically located in a very tight space, to believe that is open, virtually infinite space-we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all, such as in clubs), moving platforms and also big balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, that is a job for many years.
This is what makes the work of virtual reality so attractive to researchers, many things are in the very early days.
Vkusovština instead of culture-Rosbalt. ru
“Rosbalt” is a continuation of the project “Petersburg avant-garde”, dedicated to the people who are in the lead, are avantgardou culture and art.
At the top of the list have already been major figures in the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often located in recognition of a Europe without reaching to fame.
The new hero of “Rosbaltu” is an amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller-bearded man who is dressed all in red, which you see here at the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, here in fashionable bars and at vernisážích.
Images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of a purely social and philosophical petrohradských tellers, the creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller-it is a striking man, St. Petersburg avant-garde, the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to the city's man, and his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of the citizens, enhances the mood.
Recently took up the organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with all my life, and the philosophy of the bohemian image.
- Clive, why you're walking around dressed in red, and not in a yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose red as designer dealing with light and image.
In this world, the red colour of compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, aggression and brings out the bad.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when you know that you have to be an artist?
- On display at the house of culture on and where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
Then came a wave of old liberal unofficial artists and new, free of artists I couldn't understand.
I was friends with artists, with a new wave of post-gazoněvskými, who led us to “puškinské 10”, and the next wave.
That brings me to the theater, clothing, music, in all genres beyond words.
And all this is amalgamated in your art-clinic … - for me it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where should collect all the best powers of creativity.
In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there still existed before reconstruction musically-art club, a Bohemian Club, home of petěrburkské Bohemians.
There was the birth of many: NOM, Tequila jazz, don't forget how Šnura brought to the project “Van Gogh's ear.”
Šnur and his friends sang the plywood easy songs, they dressed in full-length leotards, midway between them composer Igor separately, which is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, has become the “Leningrad”.
Trachtenberg led many programs in this-galivských times.
We gave them Trachtěnberga, that she began to his United career, basic education and training from us.
The gallery “d 137”, “Griboedov's club-this is the aftermath of Art Clinic.
This way they left our workers and patrons.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 was organised the survey was in the press, the special price was “people in our city.”
In the nomination of “artist of the year I was appointed me, that was the end of my peak.
In the new times under the old rules is an unpleasant job, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it's easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are very different things, you can be popular, but not too much cultural.
- Your works are characterized by an identifiable manner.
Many of my paintings are hits, which is vividly captured the timeliness and penetration.
I have a program of the Russian Museum exhibition “clowns”.
Clowns are timeless categories.
In the past, I used to be social, today it is painful and awful.
But in the clowns are all blurred, scanning the tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of the totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.
Today, people face under clothing, focusing on the external drive, not on the inner man.
Or maybe he can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the illusion of change will be deleted.
Recently-we can see you in the role of urban organ grinder. - cultural city should have such a hero.
And who it should be, if not me?
- And may be commercial art fair?
- At the moment should be commercial, utilitarian art thorough, tactful, sweet.
The disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, people gathered in groups, La Bohème loved one, free from other people.
Today, everything is broken at mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I am not 100 bill, so I liked all of them.
Today is a no-brainer, whom he likes.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of its 100 fans.
- And to Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators.
- To be arrested fans, there had been involved sexually social sphere.
And the cultural ground comes 300 people and 10,000 of them coming, and the result is less management, money, everything is failing.
To supporters, the main thing is that nobody is fooled and violates what is well established.
When I was young, I was painting such images, which in one collector hung on the wall together with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which people often end up.
Today, people often confuse the concepts.
They say: a spiritual culture, the culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of consumer, it is elsewhere.
He was a man of the culture of the day before, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing to accept the money because of drawing pictures.
And I am in favour of such a culture.
- Clive, what is in Petersburg shortage?
- Good experts on culture.
There is such a concept: deputy through culture.
Not all of them, but we can deal with the culture.
At the time of the tsars that wasn't true in all the tsars, perhaps too understand culture, but they understand that there is a need to promote real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are kept somewhere in a corner, because they need big experts, who rightly appreciate these experts and the state is on the right track.
Today's thriving vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but differ in that they honestly say that not all the modern art, we accept there are artists who should look for other museums.
What do you think is the Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk-it is the Capital of Culture, in Moscow's culture much more, there is the right soil.
And on our waste is the art of doing poorly.
We need a cultural scene, but for us it is today writers more than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe, there are a great many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
There's a layer just weak.
We need to make art has become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented by means of a grant of St. Petersburg
Born in space
The country is under threat.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravan of space ships with them on board, are on the way, looking for a replacement of the planet.
To save humanity, raises a key question: how to keep his family in the fall or in the spare planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two of the planet, which is possible to learn, even if only hypothetically.
“It's Venus and Mars,” says a senior researcher at the Institute of Astronomy P.K. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while they are on Mars, better conditions for life on the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
Live there is possible only at high altitude or orbiting Venus … in the universe.
Addressing the issue of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.
Already half a century ago were carried out experiments on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from the Earth's relatives.
It was then carried out the insects into orbit — a very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979 it was sent into space a quail's eggs, to determine how the developing embryo in weightlessness.
The output is absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem arises with it, that it must find support, they need to stand on their own two feet and start to move,” said the head of the lab Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) Ran Vladimir Syčev.
If they can't find the support, the birds are falling out of the chaotic and somersault.
After 10 hours in the newly hatched birds to a complete cessation of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was that, in four days just died.
“Twice we hatched birds, but then we had refused, because it is simply impossible there working with them,” says the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last “miniarcha” with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments continue.
In “biosatelitu Bion” but are only being one sex.
There has been an experiment with rats, which were broadcast into space already pregnant.
In essence, they found nothing.
“It was just for biosatelitech, but, again, this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be carried out,” says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on Earth's cosmic rats born offspring.
Closer to the problem of reproduction in space, but have so far failed to do.
It is a tough task.
Animals at the loss of normal environmental simply cannot realise their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is abstract thinking and is able to set up a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women are flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatening Tereshkova's.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chalka away and no one on the ground was unable to say whether the last flight into space.
Whether it will be able to deliver a baby after a flight.
“But this question has no answer,” says veteran skyrocketing-space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's daughter.
The baby's father was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, was born the son of a second woman-kosmonautce Svetlana Savické, which visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open space.
The risk, however, remains.
We have only a few astronauts for long years born and grow the health of children.
“In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital flights,” says astronaut-pilot, a hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia's Valeri Polyakov.
Humanity must inevitably find new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is compulsory stage of preparations for the flight.
Here in terms of zero gravity, astronauts acquire skills needed to work in an open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
Even for adults, the water even comfortable, but it's kind of a strange environment for young children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between that and the child is averaging 9 months in his mother's journey and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it's logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, after only two weeks.
“It's a very little for the child's forgotten,” says instructor swimming newborns Marina Aksenovová.
In short, if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness natural state, then for women is more natural, inevitable gravitational attraction.
In microgravity is very quickly to the decline of abdominal muscles, muscle pans, declining ability to flesh out the foetus.
We can leave aside, if they work promoters work muscles in childbirth.
At the end of the day, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the body's mother would oust the foetus.
“What can I say?” asks Valeri Polyakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.
If not for the organism gravity, it right to form a skeleton or a set of muscles.
The newborn in orbit, it is not possible to dress like an adult in a suit with a burden, in which they could practice.
Just don't be deprived of what to its development of vitally needed.
“If you go to the experiment, which says, “the birth of a child in a foreign environment, bringing the country's disabled person, that would be totally inappropriate to our environment,” says the Commission on Bioethics IBMP wounds Igor Pestov.
So births in the universe today is not just a theoretical question.
Once again, however, the time will come when it will become a reality, and when the issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.
Chief W: check švarcsystému failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has in connection with the procurement of good quality supervisors and legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with the News. com says that the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav ape.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his administration-that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing,” says the current situation now.
Similar findings also suggest the joint control of the czech and german controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice provides access to a so-called “Peter Nečas švarcsystému”.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will entrepreneurs bother his check-is banned or permitted?
“The law must not be somehow set, and if something prevents, so even the Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the walk,” she notes.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, under which compared the legislation on public contracts in both countries.
What was specifically?
The parallel control, which we started about two years ago.
Put simply, it is a matter of european legislation that governs how public contracts to address, is followed by the national legislation, and then also the experience.
We're all of this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, showed us a very interesting differences — generally speaking, legislation is for us, maybe even “stronger and better”, but the practice is in certain parameters better in Germany.
It is, then, that it is not enough to create still further and further detailed rules, but a need to devote itself to the application of the law.
Why do you, in fact, this project can help, what will become of it for you?
One such joint control could contribute to stop efforts to refine and improve laws, reducing limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Cost-effective means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (but does not always mean the lowest price), in order to avoid any enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But, by reducing the limit of contracts, it does not need to be achieved.
Perhaps that is the system would take such an amount of “paper” that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they will benefit a lot easier than if the limit was increased.
We're talking about domestic problems in passing legislation on public procurement into practice.
How the system works checks in Germany?
There is similar to our own office which, or is it set differently?
What the authorities concerned, such as W .'s works Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in much the same way as we do, also has a division, only to form a slightly differently, but in principle, both agencies doing likewise.
Also the powers are to some extent similar, however, that Germany's federal structure, so has the following the courts and at the level of the federal state-that the system is a little different from our own.
BRH can control only the federal money for us posed by public funds.
Public funds, which are managed by us and the municipalities, they control the level of federal auditors.
What is there in terms of legislation, so that it is easier than ours?
In general, without any specific data like comparisons, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but you can certainly say that it is all better.
It's not even that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but, again, I don't have such comparisons.
But it should be said that the country, which we consider to be a model, is faced with a wide range of problems.
Otherwise, it would not be beneficial to cooperate with our office, isn't it?
In terms of domestic legislation, what your office was an amendment to the law on public procurement, and there are already some of its consequences?
In view of the fact that the duration of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control actions reflected.
Because we're doing checks, needs to be reckoned with some delays.
We are seeing that, so far, only in the process of preparing the future checks-we started our new tool for “risk detection inefficiencies”, through which we at nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed the is-there are those changes, of course, will show, because it's going to change the limits, the conditions of certain types of competition will be adjusted, and so on and so forth.
The approval of this law, so do more for benefits, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will.
The problem here may be that she “will tighten the rules” and will not be able to be respected.
Now for the functioning of the previous rules are controlled by a person committed provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs Regional Council) that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.
So has the price law tightening in this way?
“I don't think this way.
The system must not exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a technicality, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how does that leave out?
The show, which is not the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother the trader's controls of the so-called “švarcsystému” - and what does it mean?
Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?
The law must not be somehow set, and if something prevents, so even the Prime Minister cannot prevent in the activities of the office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce the walk.
You could say: “we will change the law and allow it”, but I can say that we will do, anything like that.
In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented-which is right, in order to protect the public.
But on the other hand it is tragic, as the candidate with the best offer is excluded for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his administration-that's what for us, in my opinion, is missing.
The roads are icy points, but for the most part the passable
In several places, the Czech Republic's roads are icy and snowy.
Most of them are open, but the road somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the county of Karlovy Vary were this morning roads passable in places, but ice and snow.
The temperature fell to between five to ten degrees below zero during the day, but with a slightly warm.
Snowfall in the region and stopped in the lowlands are scanty.
On top of our mountains, however, is around 30 centimetres of snow.
There was even less visibility due to fog, stems from the data to dispatch the county road crew.
R6 expressway and communication are the first class in the region now passable without restrictions.
Caution is, of course, on the spot, for example, certain přemostěních, where it may be the frosty and slippery.
The passable are also all the way in the second and third class, including mountain roads.
But in some areas is still remains frozen and skewed the snow.
Especially in higher positions should be paid to drive increased attention.
The region and Hradec
On some roads in the eastern part of the Czech Republic is in danger of frost in higher elevations and in the mountains can be on roads covered with snow, reports on its website following roads and motorways.
The road builders warn the driver before frost, may be especially above the region.
The ice may be in the vicinity of the Lanškrouna, confluence of Orlici, shelves, or Svitav HIGH Mýta, especially on the roads of second and third class.
They are chemically treated road I / 43 and I / 34 for Svitav.
The snow is particularly on the roads in Giant and Orlicke Mountains.
Driving snow is in top positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Princess and Trutnov.
In the eastern part of the Czech Republic is now mostly clear to partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three, plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Concerts
The road at the edge of this morning are passable in places, but with caution and travel needs to be adapted to the weather.
It is in the morning chill, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling may be some communication freeze.
Sometimes drivers must also take into account the fog, visibility, but will gradually improve.
It is clear from the information desk county road crew.
The D5 is almost impassable without restrictions, increased caution, however, recommend that the communication between 80 and 131 km.
Most roads first class is dry and vymrzlý.
On the southern Plzeňsku and Tachov region but may be patches of ice.
Communication of second-and third-class are damp and also in this case there is a warning on patches of ice.
Drivers should be especially careful to less-traveled roads in the Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc
With snow, slush on the road must now count drivers heading into the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical topping remained at červenohorském saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlský cross.
World into the field drove in the middle of the night, the snow on the roads as administrators Šumpersku nasněžily about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region are the most-traveled without restrictions.
“The Šumpersku lies in the highest positions of snow.
With snow, slush on červenohorském saddle drivers must count in the direction of Prague,” he said today, Stein signalman šumperské road management.
On the ground in the middle of the night and left their colleagues at Jesenicku, path and AE top positions are now under them after the chemical treatment of naked and wet.
In the Olomouc region roads are passable without restrictions on Šternbersku would, however, drivers had to watch in forest areas, where the road was wet.
Usti region, the Liberec
Several difficult passable sites reported this morning the road builders in north Bohemia.
Except a few places with fallen snow or with ledovkou is closed and the mountain road from Telnice on of Knínice on Ústecku, stems from a police database.
The temperature is held in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow on the roads seemed to linger. in lowland areas, particularly in the southeast of the Central Highlands, conversely, no problem, and the road is usually dry.
Operational complications reported so far are not.
The incidence of toothfish says the road builders in nearby Steti.
According to the meteorologists were last night in ideal conditions-day rain and melting snow in the middle of the night, clear and cold.
Of the major routes are reported adverse conditions on the road I / 13 on the borders of Usti and Liberec region.
Uzavírku from Telnice on of Knínice necessitated bent the branches of the trees that beneath the snow bent to the ground.
Shimon Ornest: at concerts to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about that, in less than a month that has come to the end of the world?
It's just one of the more alarmist, we humans like to catch.
Together with the band the TAP TAP from making more fun and what we are saying is that we are the only group in the world, which is able to collect enough positive energy to the end of the world delayed or prevented.
In December, in addition to organize your unique project three concerts at the end of the world.
You can imagine him closer to readers?
The national musicale, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11: 10 a. m. this morning.
The day before December 20 from 21 hours with co-3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end up at roughly the same time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is within the timeframe for 12 hours before us, the mayan calendar ends.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was about my idea, then we all thought, together with our artists John Augusta.
In addition, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to be together with the public to think about what kind of state once the world pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at http://www.e-TAP.com us humans can also support.
The TAP TAP, together with other performers also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world” repealed.
Today is very popular on YouTube, is also on the charity concerts?
Of course, in the very end, so if everything goes and the end of the world will occur.
Sing it all artists in all three concerts at the same time.
The anthem was a link in a unique live on czech television.
The words to the song he wrote and the role of Jesus in the video plays Tomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl x …
How did you come to get them to cooperate?
We are also working with other figures in the czech cultural scene, in view of the fact that we have a lot of charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to be heavily involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.
What can the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
The equipment accessible training centre Studeo already six-year exercise in civic associations in TAP Jedlička's Institute for the Handicapped.
For students in schools Jedličkova Institute regularly instructors and engaged in activities that they love and care.
The students themselves do not have the resources to take on the teachers went on their own, trying to get them not to allow this way.
In the framework of the constitution in the future, there will be a separate Jedličkova building into which they have with this project.
Each concert will speak several bands and performers.
According to what you choose?
We have tried to build a program that appeals to all age groups, including children.
For example, in Prague out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the TAP TAP, Blitz Bango and Jiri dry.
All the details at www. kpks. com.
You are planning a similar “bombastic action” in the future?
In May, for the first time, we will act on the Prague Spring, so there are certainly make an interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the czech national house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I'd like to tie in with the speech in Washington, D.C., and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimalist, yet he spoke up, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The TAP TAP is, however, a group of disabled people.
How these journeys are mastering logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members in an electric cart, its trucks have to travel in the baggage compartment, also, of course, carrying large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.
However, so far it's always handled without problems, CSA and British Airways to us were well prepared, that I wonder how many times.
Even in Moscow, of which we have returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to výjezdům abroad can compare how individual differ in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.
What you have met?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other places where everything works better than us, we in Russia have seen that in the East, everything is still in full at the beginning.
From Prague to Moscow's very barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric cart moving in the centre of the city.
There are no such commonplaces like wheelchair users should get priority in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civic associations, which tries to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things in which we are still lagging behind.
But it is important to note that the upgrading and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of people who are affected.
In London and Madrid, is completely normal, that is, people with severe completely independently moving on to the public can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
But it's not very common, there was a large number of people with disabilities participated actively in social life, in that we have, in fact, with the TAP TAP bit ahead!
Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only at a time when we are prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things are going to change.
Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong faith.
The band the TAP TAP is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years back what you in 1998 led to build it?
I took over as trainer to Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who have an interest in something to pay attention to.
And having been a musician, playing, among other things, on it, so I, together with my colleague founded zájmový musical circle.
Now, with the passage of time, as our host Láďa Angelovič, a little bit out of hand (laughter).
But popularity came up in recent years, isn't it?
It is true that helped us when we have begun to merge with well-known singers and also to work actively to promote the band.
There was us, that the work, which can be seen, in fact, as if they did not exist.
Thanks to the contributions of the European Union, they can afford high-quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Is your goal to go with the TAP TAP so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can do something different.
Showbusiness is stuffed with things, where one is the other.
In a way it is logical, everything new is being received with caution and it takes a long time.
Things that are isolated, there is very little, but I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, it is, of course, regret, it is natural.
But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people are not suffering from a completely abandoned all beings, which we regret.
These are the people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary resources.
I say that when things get people with completely, so it's not a shift for them, but for the whole of society.
This success has helped, too, that you have a strict boss, how many people you call?
If we want to do good work, we need to be in many ways an uncompromising and require some discipline.
But I think it is perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their heads in the clouds, and if he finds that he must go on trial twice a week, there is a product and spend a lot of time on the road at concerts, so is the enthusiasm quickly leave.
But that's the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band the TAP TAP 20 members.
How many of them were in its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people are leaving, and they can't be helped.
Who has the will and desire, has always kept its doors open for us
The day before the end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p. m.
In Prague, Brno Incheba areně Flédě and Ostrava old overman, with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities are in the evening linking telemostem in singing songs the band the TAP TAP “end-of-the-world canceled”
The concert is to collect funds to equip the multifunctional accessible training centre at STUDEO Jedlička's Institute for the Handicapped in Prague in the $25 million USD
Tickets to the concert are $400, children up to the age of 12 are free entry tickets in already Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency accepted Poland for the 20th member of the European Space Agency, like the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (for the Czech Republic, which is a full-fledged member of the ESA has 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched an enhanced co-operation with the ESA in 1994, and in the last few years have been involved in a number of projects for the agency.
However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Flights into space is devoted to the polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.
Recall, for example, the class A. Šternfelda in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which 6 December 1933 imagined thoughts of his pioneering work entry into space.
Thoughts of a young engineer (born in 1905) left audiences cold and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski said about his work.
Šternfeld in 1934, gained entry into space in France of the Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and Andre Louis Hirscha.
The Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a big advocate of Astronomy and Space.
In the polish magazines published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world's most famous advocate of aerospace and his contribution was valued by the fact that one of the crater on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
Already in 1925 was in Poland built rolling trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and there is even the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the start-up of the trolley or to its application.
Information about this handcar are known only from the period of the press.
Since 1933, the rocket shells began to deal with polish artillery.
Research by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of german troops research was interrupted.
In 1937, in academic journals, discovered a photoelectric the interceptors, which suggested an engineer Rohoziński and in the following year went work Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of rocket technology gave temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), that all the work is being coordinated.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years the activities of its activities to start a war.
Further work on the space after the war in the polish press thanks to the work of the polish company astronautical (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time there is mention of the company in the November edition of the year 1954 Problemy magazine, in which there are four more comprehensive sections devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company, which will take up space.
At that time, it was already out of the projects and artificial satellites, it was clear that the space research is a promising field.
Since the beginning of the year, 1956, Poland's Astronautics Society (PTA) snažia on entry into the international astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and now in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, the first chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became a vice-president of the International Federation of astronaut.
This feature until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of a highly successful meteorological rockets Rome (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish missile, which has conducted scientific research.
The first type of Rome-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a ceiling of 1,800 metres long, 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
This was later built an improved version of the Rome-1A, and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the desert Bledovské flight tests of two-stage rockets Rome-2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
Further development of the type you should be able to actual scientific work-rocket Rome-34 should have a ceiling to 14.5 km, and its task of monitoring the height of the wind.
However, in 1962, was suspended for further development.
The successor to the first rocket-type Rome became the rocket meteor-1 emerging from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Developed three types (indicated by a meteor-1A and 1B-of-1C), different sizes of space for scientific instruments.
In a rocket meteor-1A was available space on the volume of 0.4 per litre, meteor-1B on volume of 0.34-litre and meteor-1C on volume of non-litre.
The maximum ceiling for all three types of was 37 km.
The years between 1965 and 1968 was in the institute's development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket meteor-2 should be starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry payloads weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Were subsequently built version of a meteor-H and Meteor-3.
Still, it is worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of a National Committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also under the Intercosmos engaged in research into space aboard a soviet-made satellites and in 1978, polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after Vladimir Remek second interkosmonautem.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution prompted a lively public debate.
Certainly, it would be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world, based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic departments, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict between them.
This is the principle of free trade and free movement of unrestrained private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
The influence of the strong prices work (wages) is due to the tension.
As such, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition, that “upset” the price of a competitor to tear down a larger share of the market and thereby increase their profits.
On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or to buy cheap, or terminated. the result is high unemployment in countries where the cost of labour in comparison with other large economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, and responsibility for it produced unemployment, are not necessarily social state spending.
The situation adds to an absolute unwillingness to Messrs entrepreneurs pay taxes and this is no substitute for economic and social corporate losses in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to give specific figures.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the form of individual economies, a situation where governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of its people, with the aim of attracting foreign capital.
In other words, governments are private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.
It was especially affected by the changes in existing laws.
To make its own population is economically by the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
It's going on, on the other hand, the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, partly by limiting the rights of workers in the field of employment law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already a number of years public offices of food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.
The number of these people are already in the millions.
In order to enhance the competitiveness of the german economy is currently in a case that has been properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay the state into the breadline.
But the scandal has been published, and, in the case of auxiliary staff of the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same state where people are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of the social level either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or languish on starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might one day come private investment capital.
There must be, but ask but where does?
If it's going to be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or don't come at all, because the chinese, indian, brazilian or Turk Marokánec, or egyptian or african still work for a fraction of the wages.
It concerns the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theories and media ad nauseam, argues that the state cannot participate in the capital in its own economy, that control of the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly to insist that the state cannot control interventions to intervene in the economy.
Then there is reason to question whether private equity does not affect, now in control of policy and this nation in its own egoistickém sense.
There is a definite answer yes.
Evidence of the existence of virtually all-powerful and in all the states of the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation occurs in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the legislation, which is practically everything reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for lack of funds to draw up bills to private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All this does not come from the people of how the Constitution's doctrine of western-style, but from the financially powerful groups preferujících's own interests.
It is clear that the liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly coming into the situation, as he describes in his book Appiános crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: “the state had long been in complete meltdown, and authorities are taking possession of violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition of patronage and for using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people went to vote with pre-sold voice” … “decent people on board at all apply, so once was as a result of the failure of the state eight months without consuls”.... “it started to really talk about it, that the only remedy in a bad situation is samovláda and the need for a more energetic man.” while thinking about Appiános Pompey, but he became the Caesar, which changed to take democracy for self-rule.
The conclusion, as well as in Antiche is contemporary society based on reckless preference for their own benefit, regardless of a society-wide interest.
Private capital is not inherently unable to understand and apply the benefit of society.
The result is now, as then, the unparalleled decadence elites without any attempts at reform of the profound.
The causality onset of fascist and communist regimes must therefore seek in indiscriminate liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In its current state, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy type considered as a break with the expectations of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elite completely ignored in the possibility of a future Environmental loss of life, humanitarian and social disaster, which we have already seen together with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not an option, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition, both on the international and european level, the Ministry of the Interior, the Government of the Czech Republic to continue to find ways to further reduce the welfare of the population.
This trend is therefore the system.
The solution is a political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of the citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the country.
Israel: the chaos.
“The violence will come from nothing and neither can never” Sting in song, “Fragile whose main line in the chorus is “let's not forget how we're fragile.”
“If my sons did not want war, there would have been no” dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild Amschela in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, started a lot of reactions.
One is for Israel, arguing his right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue racism in the State of Israel, the genocide perpetrated against the palestinian arabs and fit into the role of the State of Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about it, who is periodically repeated waves of killing the culprits and victims, who, after all, today's residents of Israel, including self-governing territory was born in the current political situation and the start of the violence.
My point is to offer readers to peek behind the curtain, look at it, who will primarily serve already 95 years of tension (dating from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts are some of them based on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is, first and foremost, a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find some of the Alexander the great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is if it were always those figures, which are completely autonomously manage their steps, or whether their throne was someone who guided their actions to advance vytýčenému objectives.
We have to admit that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could take place during the lifetime of a generation.
Among those astronomically rich families singled out one, which could be regarded as the head of octopus (if there was one of them, I don't know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.
Many of them say.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought back in the 1990s. the 19th century to stop linking his name with highly criminal acts, in the background, and it has always been the consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth, or both.
The shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank should not be conducting or preparing for war (against attacks by Afghanistan's seven countries, after the attack on Iraq that was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi's left with only four, but in the meantime, Russia's central bank subordinated to the russian government).
Anyone with this family tried to resist, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Central Bank Rothschieldově Bank of America, began during the civil war to issue their own (read the government's) money, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was in 1936, poisoned after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power has resulted in years of 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars Mason High, 33-degree-Albert Pike.
The first war to remove large royal government units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial mansion in Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population at 0.5-1 billion people (a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a fertile ground for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group's richest families headed by Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and subsequent offering solutions (order Ab chaos and order from chaos).
These solutions are false and always leads to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, to avoid a repetition of the crisis like the one created in 1907).
So, after they had an assassination of the heir to the throne in r-Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed the Czarist Russia running of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for the war to destroy the Tsarist Russia) and leading to the unraveling of the central powers of Austria, Hungary.
In order to facilitate the launching of the Second World War left bankers policies create a latent conflict situation in Germany have imposed huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they just slip the Germans sufficiently strong, identifying the culprits and simple solution to the applicant's leader and further by creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, which should play, and also played a role, the fifth column, sparking a fire.
At the end of the 19th century to inspire Rothschieldové establishing the Zionist movement, whose one branch has sought to create a jewish state, not preferentially in the historic Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Already mentioned Balfourova Declaration has created the mass immigration of jews to Palestine, have started to occur first clashes with local arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, if Hitler had come off the chain, which it initially held international bankers, or everything that was made in the plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camp, created a prerequisite for acceptance of the jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and in much the same way as it was war reparations Germany launched the second world war was the State of Israel created a third outbreak of war.
If international bankers can unleash, will be the jewish nation, in much the same way as in the other victims in the first line of the fighting, now jointly with the Arab or Muslim populations in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also in the international arena (consider just how sharply divided between supporters and opponents of the people of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the palestinian-israeli conflict, where violence begets injustice in an endless chain of violence, though at the beginning of all was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, decided to give them international bankers people a choice in the elections solely its own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example fašizujícího, to international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), has threatened to escalate into a global conflict and given to the control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all the world's oil shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what now seems words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: “what we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their vision is a world masters and slaves.
The rest of the world, where the human population we need the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The world, where everyone is a newly-born individuals implanted in the birth of the chip, which will make it totally controlled entity.
“And forcing all small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have his right hand or on his forehead brand, so that it could buy or sell, who is under the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
It is important to understand: who has the sense to count the number of the beast.
This indicates the number of humans and the number is the balance sixty-six.”
The film Argo: when is the worst call in Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
We should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who after the revolution, fled to the United States, which had been a patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration situation offered a positive outcome of the Shah-throw overboard couldn't afford, because it would significantly harm confidence among allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.
Detention of diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations brokered an algerian government.
Their plight at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck's Argo describes one episode in the history of America, which has resulted in a small victory.
Just prior to the occupation of the embassy of her escaped six employees.
After a complex business ended up in the residence of the canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the canadian authorities had managed to get them from Iran, helped the extravagant cover story-went to the canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country at the location for filming the sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by an expert on “exfiltraci” Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
That myth was credible, we wrote about the film project in the specialist magazine, held a press conference, fictional production company should have a real office.
Details of the operation were long classified, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.
The film is a combination of more specific Affleckův genres.
On the one hand, realistically broad political thriller, at the same time, the so-called “right” movie, the story of vydařeného piece, foul play — can be seen as an example of a series of Danny's teammates.
In the film, so changing mood-on the one hand documentation or evidence-ranging sequence of Tehran (titulkové sequence are shown ikonické photographs of events and the manner in which they were the same situation presented in the film-the large differences in it).
On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there was the scene from CIA headquarters and other institutions-the men in suits are discussing the situation at the table, in the corridors, on the phone.
Ben Affleckovi remarkably managed to restart his career.
Become an object of mockery of the actor became a respected director, as well as his acting has ceased to be a target of a cynical comment.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark Krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller city (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleckův slide, which take place in režisérově Boston home.
A sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of the director's earlier films place above the Hollywood standard.
Affleck and it also reflected in argos, where Tehran “plays” Canada.
The best scene in the movie is unfolding in the streets, while rekonstruování actual events-the opening sequence the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotion and confusion nepřevídatelnosti that ensue when they move out of history.
A similar effect and his colleagues are in scenes of fabricated (false staff in Tehran bazaar).
Too many things in too many places
The director has had to deal with the fact that the story told by offering doesn't really in the film the sensational scenes.
Quite successfully with it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - there's everything so elegantly rises (the scene in which the looming crisis at Tehran airport refused to call in America and chase down the runway looks rather far-fetched).
But the weakness of the Argo's ramblings arising from the need to show too many things in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are roles in Hollywood's colleagues are very charming, their figures but he deserved more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.
Affleckův movie sort of losing a dramatic move, it's image, which can be monitored with mild interest, to pay tribute to the implementation and retro-style reminiscent of the thrillers of the 1970s.
But push hard.
As a reminder of the one still has a way of living history, proof of how far-fetched are images of suffering and all-knowing the secret service, but it will suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The site www. bankovnipoplatky. com, which publishes annual survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU”.
“This led us to the last event when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the management of large european companies,” said Law organizer Patrick Nacher survey.
Among the nominated the absurd is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights on the unification of premium rates for men and women.
Yet while women were in the price of life insurance beneficiary, because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Another incredible ideas from the EU may nominate people by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 13,” said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulation is needed, as well as mandatory blending of biofuels into the fuel, which as a result of harmful to nature, to ban the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the size of cages for hens, which this year significantly more expensive eggs.
Previously faced criticism as well as a de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or disposal of light bulbs from the sale.
The quality of bananas have 14 inches
The camera often decides under pressure or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (and the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto promotes the requirements of its banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind it, for example, that the highest quality of bananas in the Union consists of at least 14 cm and may not have “abnormal curvature”.
The European Commission has said that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which were complicated by trading.
Rules on fruit and vegetables for the EU despite the opposition of some states with softened by pointing out that the directive will lead to food waste.
The candidate to victory in the poll may be the last year the EU regulation, which must be sold in toy balloons without notice, that is, children younger than 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU's appeal to the U.S. research, in which balloons are among the leading cause of death in children's toys to suffocation.
Similar restrictions are now paying for children up to 14 years for blowing the carny frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home
Rather it is absurd and then rule on european officials to anyone who has a formal role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the issue for Greece's use of the name Macedonia and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky. com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire wrote in the polls, some of the above mentioned absurdities even EU regulations on the volume of food supplies to the territory.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which may be present in the territory of the Czech Republic in the day of our entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic then crossed, e. g., laid down in the volumes of canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a fine.
The organisers of the poll took the idea to pay some countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies at the request of the receiving subsidies.
Those ideas, however, have emerged in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We're handicapováni that we don't have the sea.
We ask the European Union for reimbursement,” he said in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, has indicated that he is with us bred a lot of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to be exported.
For that, the Czech Republic has continued to ports, we want the EU to Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission turned out to the Czech Republic to meet that organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to obtain subsidies offered to municipalities, the Ministry for Regional Development Minister Paul managed by the German (US-DEU), in particular, should go to the drawing up of a request for funding from Brussels.
The EU's bizarre regulation are the exception:
Regulation is in the Member States could easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the whole of the European Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.
More serious is the problem, according to experts, for example, drawing on EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of european integration, but that was in the budget negotiations led to the Member States.
Emotions between Czechs raises that, as well as other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to specific indications of their traditional products, which do not always succeed in this fight.
The czechs are in the six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians uphold the latter name, but domestic rum, whose tradition for us dates back to the 19th century, our producers to rename tuzemák.
The naming of rum can carry only products from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU is in the company of the world-renowned feta cheese and Gorgonzola, marzipan from german Lübeck Parma ham, for example, or have left the biscuit, Pohořelický and třeboňský carp and žatecký hops.
The trade mark of the EU are also proud of the product and the wafers.
People want to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, one wonders, that he wants to run for president?
It's not meant to be a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't look at the last 20 years, as the country's rozkrádá thieves run, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like that, so I'm trying to come up with a solution to change that.
And since I was 40 and I'm independent nestraník, I don't have any choice, how things affect, than to run for senator or president.
In the Senate, you get, but then you started at the castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
The whole time I was told that in the battle for the castle will go according to the outcome of the congressional elections.
Later, I explained that if I am elected senator, I'm running for president.
My goal but not a function, function is a tool, how can carry out his vision.
That's why we need a maximum influence and what the strongest mandate.
The problem is not just that we, as a nation, things in the pub and in front of the tv, but by trampling on everybody who wants to try to change.
To this is added to the media that the man dehonestují and confuse the freedom of speech, the freedom to lie.
For me, to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was adviser Jiri Paroubek.
Let's go to your vision.
In the battle for the castle you started with the idea of material and the criminal responsibility of politicians and the financial returns over twenty million.
The need to change the law.
As president, but you don't have that kind of authority, and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How are you going to solve?
When I was a citizen lobbied for it to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it.
The problem is politics, when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, is rejected, and citizens' lives.
As an independent nestraník have far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without a partisan categorization of dogmas and you can take something that is for our country, the best from each side and apply it.
You think you're more of a man of right-wing or left-wing?
From the point of view, it seems to me that people are more to the left.
For me it's not important whether a little to the left or a bit to the right.
For me, it is important for us to go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to bring people together.
Always support any public good solutions, even if it suggests that the Communist Party or the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), and so I will be against a bad idea.
Angry when someone says about you, that you are a populist.
But it's doing what you said?
If you build byznysplán so you also have in the company, an ideal objective and vision.
And it is trying to close.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about, in the world of work, or talking about important specialists.
But without the support of Parliament, you would have just slogans.
And it's going to be in politics in the long term nevystačíte.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to push through, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists and members of the public and to try to get them on your side to pull it.
If he was elected president, there is no problem hold televised live, where I will ask the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to say, why do not want it.
When is a strong personality who will be giving abuses can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was because of public pressure.
On the plane, I say that I am an amateur, that I am not a genius, or an intellectual.
For his views and vision are trying to seek allies.
I have been in politics has only just begun, and for his program is trying to win the support of the majority.
Things I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't work, for six years to finish, and return to the private sector.
It sounds as if Okamura had to save the country.
I'm no savior.
I know that, in the case of one person won't do anything, so I walked around a number of well-known people, whether it would also run for the Senate.
I went to Radimem Jančurou, because of the amount of work has declined.
So I at least support investigative journalist Jan Lorencovou which rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now it's a coin toss.
Sixty percent of the people who work for the elections and those who went to elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we just two independent.
People navolili Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Still, I'm going to fight for your vision, such as for the direct election of mayors or generals.
Are you considering establishing his own party?
I still think about it, because I don't have time to check the net past any potential Party guy, and I don't have the money.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
Talking about financial returns, what's yours?
Private property is about 60 million.
In Prague's land roughly $25 million, an apartment for ten million, another home for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, Aston Martin for $3.5 million and Skoda superb per million, and then I've got a few million in the account.
Incidentally, Aston Martin, because it was my boy's dream-I've always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, he was courteous to women and, at the same time, he fought against the wickedness and excesses.
Aston Martin, you have the assets for 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change, but their own money into it too much to give you don't want to.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
It will get into debt?
In the campaign, I rushed for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors, testifies to the fact that on my program might not be such an interest.
And I don't have an obligation to pay part of their campaign.
The cost of the campaign I basically cover what I receive senátorský salary.
But it would, for example, couldn't pay nevyžil son english school, which costs 30 thousand per month.
I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So, you will continue to do business, to live?
Didn't you say that these activities utlumíte?
But it has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As promised, their activity was partly allayed.
For example, the travel agent in the spring will become my representative.
People would like us to be Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I also need to live.
How many of you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I were the president, I would put an end to their business.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of the law.
The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure will occur only in his mind — for example, Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books-2 pictures
“The building seems to me to be cheerful, looks like a futuristic. finally, it is once again to see something interesting,” says Lisette Verhaig, which goes over the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, it techniques in the Middle large business, says: “of course, the house is nice.”
However, I wonder, why do we still need a library.
They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
None of those libraries in the old-style already voluntarily and nobody goes, or is it?
Spijkenisse, neighborhood in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth a visit, is holding a special record.
This community of 80,000 people, the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To this silly situation resolved, died a few years ago, the decision to contribute to a general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced thumbnail fictional bridges, which are shown on euro notes.
The success of educational offensive but not staggering.
And so town officials recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we have to have a library.
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely courageous Column graphs and the issuer of humorous, often even cynical buildings, the thing with the usual calm and negotiations on competition in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission still stunned, looking around and shrugs, piling up bold Maas their gifts, according to the size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words “Dear urban community!”
This, then, is my proposal to the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million against.
It is part of revitalizačního project, which also entails an underground parking lot, a supermarket, post office and several adjoining residential and rank-and-file home with a total of 50 homes.
In early November, was a mountain of books honored second place “best Library of NL 2012”.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.
Small-town, which still could offer more than post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly town hall, whose white facade would rather expect dairies, is due to the richer on a bit of contemporary architecture.
But, above all, it is now the first public Spijkenisse cultural construction in the history of their existence.
A long way to book
First impression: reading the Eldorado under glass on the cheese.
By means of the mountains while riding the elevator, but the actual space and reading passions up until the close control of topography.
From all sides of the glass-walled interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And all the books, books, books.
“Normally stands the bookshelves along the front and center is a dark area, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have the classic spatial configuration built upside down and space for the reader, extending from the inside out.
The interior of the mountains of books is cleverly exploited: Wednesday's offices, online library, chess club, eco-centre and the front-of-the-art.
Special comfort are black shelves for books that were once lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the stairs.
The appearance of the structure, and the smell is alien to him.
The new building material to shake their heads and even the bitterest architects and engineers.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the municipality of Spijkenisse, to question the magazine standard.
And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands is used as a base by the roots of a millimetre of synthetic material.
It is cheap and effective.
The thin fabric lasts one or two seasons, and then be ready to blow up in a bulky waste.
The library was fleece-for the first time in such a quantity-pressed down on the boards of four inches.
The heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic shut) turns in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps to get to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres of the long journey will be in a literary cafe rewarded not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the dutch croquettes and ficus trees in pots.
Those responsible for the atmosphere, but mainly on the right humidity in the literature.
Donations for the new soul
“I don't believe that, but this house is, in spite of the many glass desktops a project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling the Earth's heat.
Although the mountain of books is under glass, the sun shines in a short time, and even on sunny days.
The broad glued wooden-beams, which stands across the glass facade, serves as a shield and picks up a large portion of solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest of the fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of it industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde who Boekenberg even referred to as “long-awaited soul” Spijkenisse.
The reason: each of the city's population was a few weeks ago, was not invited to the opening to devote one book from his personal funds.
So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully equipped with a library, which currently stands at 70,000 units.
The concept has been proven.
The shelves are completely filled.
“There is nothing worse than a half-full library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that, thanks to our invitation, now has a new home every inhabitant of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it was just for show.
It is MVRDV worked in the discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated.
That, after all, is the starting point for an identity.
Szabo: “the Germans must play a greater role.”
Germany abstained in the decision-making process for the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa that Berlin teeters on the edge of a narrow diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany earlier this week first signaled that it would vote against the proposal to the palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel is prudent.
But at the same time I think that he will not support the american position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence — without, of course, would be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
That ultimately put NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take on major international issues is a clear position?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction of policy, which was, in a manner of speaking, orchestrated by the US, in the direction of the german foreign policy.
The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the Europeans have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are, therefore, between the two lines.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think of himself in his role until settling in, but they are on the way to a more “normal” foreign policy.
In foreign policy, as in France or Britain.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy from the german point of view?
Shows readiness to take in the event of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the U.S. or european partners.
I think that Germany's foreign policy is not motivated by economic policy, so the export and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other nations, and because Germany has to protect its interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict, and a vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a big market in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf.
It must, therefore, be careful not to discourage the public, but not the elite in the arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
I wouldn't want it but not to ascribe too much importance, it is completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays a significant role in the deliberations.
Damaged relations with the US, Germany, when Germany was in the case of two important decisions abstentions, for example, at the time of the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the US, has a lot of sympathy for Germany's stance.
Therefore, I don't think it was as dramatic as a breakthrough on the issue of Libya.
Let's hope it's Germany even gain some respect.
It signals that must be regarded as an international player and its interests have to be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for the veto.
There are between the US and many european nations' differences?
These differences exist in the wake of America's internal policies.
I think that the Obama administration has probably had a great deal of sympathy for the european position.
But as a result of the political situation in this position, of course, carry out publicly.
I think that differences in opinions really aren't so great, as they always seem to.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama isn't much impressed with Netanyahu's policy.
It is difficult for Germany to align its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and to the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For the Germans, of course, would be a little bit easier, if there was a coherent and united european policy, which is currently not the case.
Therefore cannot be part of a wider line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.
That is just what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany would take a leading role in the future and will push Europe toward the european position.
It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play an independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player? he ever wants to take the lead?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still used, it's still painful, and for this country is, for obvious reasons, is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role, created the post of mood.
It does not facilitate the Germans.
It is, in fact, an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and views, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in european politics now has steadily declined, but the EU this vacuum currently do not otherwise. who's left?
The Germans would just have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't, they feel uncomfortable and it makes them even more neoblíbenějšími-c'est la vie!

“The protection of brands” in China: when are the Puma and Armani suddenly chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is the designation, which is completely officially registered in China, but the company has nothing to do with the original.
However, enjoys protection as long as it is the real owners get an indictment marks.
And even then, it is unclear whether they have rights.
“For foreigners, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect its brand in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of copyright in the Far East.
Each week, lands on my desk in the new case.
Counterfeiters have had a few letters, so that they can apply for their brands.
From Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada, instead they register the Prada-Kny.
In this way, they are legally copied and german companies, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens the cabinet's trademark office in Beijing.
14 September 2010 was left one chinese firm to protect brand Zegna DF Puma. artificial name parazituje even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in copying and violations of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities are multistory department stores, which are almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
Pattlochovy cases are but another. on behalf of their clients is opposed to chinese firms have received from the trademark office is officially a right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.
The chinese call it “Bang Mingpai” tag attached.
This is in line with the word “Bang Dakuan”.
That meant women who hunt rich men.
The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“That is to the detriment of business, we have to combat it,” invites Pattloch.
“The mark is diluted, monopoly disappears, the damage to the image of it is enormous.”
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries running into the millions, particularly in expensive sample products.
According to data from the company's market research for CLSA China is a $15 billion per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing rapidly.
The deletion of dubious records in the record labels, however, may be difficult to achieve, and it costs money.
Management can stretch for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells the story of cases in which the court rejected the claim, because the contested name has become after a long period of “market reality”.
When the plaintiff misfortune plagiátorovi still must pay for damage to its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
The cases are also affecting the graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company, which recently took over the german manufacturer of pumps on the cement mixture Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still may use the emblem, which is similar to the star of the Mercedes.
Geely, the company that bought Volvo, originally used the blue-and-white logo, which resembled a BMW. the dispute was settled, geely had to change the logo.
The fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers of Hong Kong and Singapore, who had known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
A 2.3 grade point Office CTMO recognizes that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of staff and premises.
But in the last year, the supposedly “the working process returned from an emergency situation to normal”.
For example, the number of unprocessed an opposition fell 22 percent.
Celebrated, 57,000 of these cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for office still 81 500 complaints pending.
To do something about it is expensive
As is the case in China, often it's an impressive number.
Last year it was CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly one-third more than the year 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China for the tenth time, leads the list of new applications throughout the world.
This also applies to a number of all existing trade marks, there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
Basically, this means that each on the average cost of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Start against this dispute is worth several times, as shown in the case of german family business acquisition.
This group has more than seven years of fighting against chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans had achieved that was cancelled by the illegal manufacture of imitovaných automobile parts.
But a counterfeiter secured China's rights to the brand will continue to compete.
That alone would have failed, because in Germany cannot be protected by name, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management company's acquisition of Chemical specialities in Munich.
A 2.3 grade point Office CTMO then also questioned the Munich firm rejected.
In two other instances, while the acquisition of rights, but the claim in the dispute is fighting continues to this day.
It must be awful to watch
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: “the procedure is extremely expensive and it takes a lot of time, money and the nerves.”
The internal costs cannot be quantified. in the archives of the company had to even see a hundred years old, to produce the evidence.
Five years ago the company's acquisition of the opposing party in vain offered “high six figures in the euro” in order to settle the dispute.
“You can see what it means to us,” says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will hit Europe, too.
And in any case, when there imitators will ensure unprotected brands.
One chinese manufacturer in Germany, for example, wanted to sign the acquisition for footwear and leather.
This area of business, the group gave up a long time ago, it was able to avert the registration.
“We need to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
He and his lawyer Pattloch advises german companies that were in the trade with China is very cautious.
Not enough to rely on international law známková. foreigners would rather have “everything that in any way is worth protecting, submitted in China”, says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if the company compete in the last act of the drama of the mark, then I will have to pay the license fees for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or will we be in contentious segment pushed out of the market.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, aid
In Heidelberg tested chorus Imbongi-and in Swaziland are happy orphans from his parents, who had died of AIDS.
The story of concentration, which exceeds more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there is a thumping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's loafers to scour the floor time and quickly find themselves.
One-two-three-four.
Then they run the voices of singers-Alt, Bas, tenor and soprano-pushing, cajoling and each encounter.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, combining the voices of their liquid wild gestures.
It's Monday night. at the music hall of the Institute of medical psychology at Heidelberg College Imbongi tested the new song.
It came to 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69 years, since the researchers of human genetics at the concierge.
“Om'Obani” is not easy to track every chorus of voices has a different story, and he's in a foreign language-Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid to self-help
Unaids, the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, estimates that worldwide there are an estimated 34 million people are infected with the HIV virus.
The 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 orphans from his parents, who had died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans from his parents, who had died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found a bunch of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can take over patronage.
Guaranteeing a child's tuition, school uniforms and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language “a storyteller,” or “one who praises.”
Fluent bantuštinou couldn't in this area don't speak, just sing.
Nearly ten years practicing choir songs in this strange soft speech and sometimes it also brings back there, where they originally come from: South Africa.
In the air, a distance of 8 733 miles from Heidelberg is, in fact, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the strength of the votes of the german judiciary.
Forty percent of the infected
There are roughly 2,000 people, some of them in a simple mud and straw huts. a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, as well the Swaziland: the highest rate infikovanosti HIV, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carries the virus weakened immunity. there is no rarity that die in less than 30 years.
This village discovered a body in the joint trip across Africa in the spring of 2005. but most members Imbongi saw many children on the streets of the city, which was not only parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a complete school education are in a poor country, had no chance at all.
Initially, it was still the deployment of private individuals, which for a couple of euros a year to send a child to school and give them one hot meal a day.
But a year later it was based choir group “Voices for Africa”, which has since been taking care of orphans of parents who died from AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial sleep to syphilis, chlamydia and blue balls (GONORRHOEA).
Frequent sleep are the HIV virus, human papillomaviruses, cold glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and parasitic mite belong to sleep.
Who belongs to a group of the most affected?
Syphilis and blue balls can be found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between the men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often, Chlamydia infection trichomonády, thrush (mold), blue balls and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is between heterosexual adults in our extended relatively few, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV is accounted for by this group.
Among adolescents, Chlamydia infections occur far more frequently than other population groups.
According to the survey, three-fourths of all infections involving young people from 15 to 25 years.
In addition, between juveniles often human papillomaviruses.
As the number of infections has evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of people infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute, from 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled, to $3698 disease in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV every year since 2007.
The year 2011, around 700 cases.
That is roughly one-tenth of less than a year earlier.
What signs point to venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, the difficulty in urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain and tenderness or warts.
Often, however, does not cause any pain or other symptoms, and will therefore nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
The danger of the disease can reduce the use of condoms, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.
Because the perpetrator of the sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted infections and partly from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, particularly in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis can cure most sleep and prevent long-term consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, honorářům, which earns choir singing throughout Germany, to collect some of the money.
“We are already in the Esitjeni sent around 200 000 euros,” says the group's Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany manages in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, self-confident woman who can impose.
It is also about to orphaned children find shelter, for example, some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, in the language of the Zulu says old women are the backbone of a village.
Some of them were even 14 orphans, giving them a roof over his head and taking care of children to appear every day on time in uniform to school.
Children who don't have to go to the shelter Khanyisile, a lone woman paid by society as well as two cooks on a daily basis by cooking for more than 200 hungry children.
“Voices for Africa,” the US-based school sewing, put two henhouses and together with american health organisations dogs do that many people in the village had to test for HIV.
It is not granted. even if there is a disease throughout the country so obvious, all of it is silent.
The king's 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has nothing to do with sexuality.”
Actually, oddly enough in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch, King Mswati III of black Africa, is known for his lifestyle too.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus in recent decades and spread rapidly.
But even many migrant workers who were carrying the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are not on every street corner for free, “but no one is being used.
Culture is different-unprotected intercourse.”
To at least some support cultural exchange, traveling chorus Imbongi once every two or three years, after South Africa and singing songs full of grief, combativeness, confidence in the future and the self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the continent are known from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the speech of blacks — such a measure not only brings humor and joy, but also has already elicited tears from many wild border troops.
Road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers will visit children, over whom they have patronage.
Even if this village barely can be found on maps in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than familiar.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” say the people there.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8733 kilometer dupajícím singers in rehearsal at Bergheimer 93, you see that light shines here as well.
NASA's Mercury Messenger: appeared on ice
Messenger probe found evidence that the planet Mercury is on ice.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though he is closest to the sun, there is also the frozen water, as is clear from the three studies, which on Thursday published a scholarly journal “science”.
Messenger probe found evidence that in this area of the planet, which is in permanent shadow, there is ice cap.
It is alleged to have been at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 feet thick.
The water seems to come from comets or perhaps from the asteroid, which crashed into the Mercury.
But let us find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we could help clarify how the water and other basic elements of life in other regions of the solar system.
The probe, telescopes and little robots like Phoenix, nepozorovaní terrestrials, is involved in the exploration of the universe.

Pictures of spiral galaxies, according to their colouring becoming true works of art.
Picture, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light-years away in the constellation of the shooter.

Our eyes in space: the most important telescopes
The telescope allegedly invented the year 1620 Hans Lipperhey. before Galileo Galilei it a year later, he used to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes still larger — and the broker, are deepening.
The largest telescope in the world was over a period of 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror image of this had a diameter of five meters.
In the US state of Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope.
You can consult the universe using two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 metres.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands-La Palma is enormous. only a mirror is measured by an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, saving costs.
Still, the average is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of low-priced fashion design: a telescope is secured hákovadlem communication angle, which limited his mobility.

The feature is the high gain flux.

The space telescope, Kepler searches since March 2009 after extrasolárních planets — especially for those that are habitable.
2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the start of the mission was established 1235 candidate planets.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will soon be in 2018 fired into space aboard rockets Ariane5.
The primary mirror of space-based infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 feet.
One of the tasks of the telescope is looking for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the south pole of the Mercury.
For that, however, there are no reliable data, since Messenger circling the planet's far closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurements showed for several decades that Mercury is on ice.
Thanks to the probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first that revolves around Mercury, scientists have now assured.

Searching for clues in the country where they are 97letí people are still relatively young.
Driving range Talyš can call wildly romantic.
The bus rumbling down the road with many curves along the densely wooded hills, wild rivers and simple rustic cottages.
Everything is green and lush, it almost seems that we're at Schwarzwaldu.
But that is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. the border with Iran is just a few miles away.
Here are caucasian ethnic group Talyšů, about which he is not very well known, in addition, that's perfectly Persian and ázerbájdžánsky and living with a very old age.
The final stop is Lerik.
The town boasts too monumental architecture of soviet times, which is in the picturesque mountain landscape somehow inappropriate.
Tourists from Europe. the arrival of tourists are staying away from Baku in Azerbaijan is too difficult.
The 323 miles is needed for eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth, for which the country owes a lot to oil in the Caspian Sea, coming into the country had not yet arrived.
Pilatus Fatullayev (48), however, is convinced that the Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku in May is famous for the Eurovision Song Contest-and we're next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatullayev.
The director of the museum's longevity, probably one in the world.
There is a documented life nearly eight dozen Talyšů from the area who are older than 100 years. Fatullayev shows black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years.
In an age of 136 years to have a child.
The star of this museum is, however, a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, which allegedly was 168 years.
The birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And whereas the oldest man in the documents was 122 years, it seems extremely dubious Müslümovův age.
“He was born in this area in 1805 and 1973 died,” says Fatullayev.
The man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children. in the age of 136 even fathered her daughter.
He therefore Şirali Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
For many years people in Central Asia, however, heard the Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
“Obviously many people aged lives and in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “also in Sardinia is extremely many very old men.”
Because of the lack of supporting evidence, however, cannot be made, no scientific proof of age, especially when they are missing from the registry office.
Each day of the melted butter
But the fact is that the people in the area around Leriku living biblical age very often.
Currently, there are 20 people, which are more than 100 years old.
So why are so many people here in the south of the aged?
The Azerbaijani Farid Mugimzadeh explains that specific genes Talyšů.
Museum director Fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in nutrition.
But that was just the calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of whom daily drinking a glass of the melted butter, is so healthy, from bromatologického terms it is credible.
Or is it the old way of life that keeps young people? in the tiny village of Cengemiranu, near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In 97 years is at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, who says she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí by relentlessly rolling.
Under one roof, there are eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzajevy. both are long overdue.
Around prance and two small children.
In the kitchen, for guests make a cup of tea, which is administered in the sagging jars of “typical”, he said.
White teeth Mirzajevy consists of a series of hidden beneath a scarf and long dark blond braided, ahead of us proudly revealing her son.
I was washing my hair milk, so I didn't look and keep the color.
“I also never used shampoo,” says Mirzajeva.
The monthly pension to sustain life
Eating only what came from its own auditors, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life I never buy food in the supermarket.
He tells of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was in the Second World War.
But things improved when the oar took “beloved father Heydar Aliyev.”
Propaganda is from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which makes around figures father of nations, which ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
Since coming to power in 2003, then took the oar his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan, at least, do not suffer from poverty.
Mirzajeva receives each month pension 230 manats (roughly the same amount in euros). this is the situation, one of whom is a good way to make a living.
And maybe it has also long grizzled son Mirzajevy: “old people enjoy in our culture in high esteem.”
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible

Justice is to be stripped of power?
234 sections which stohlavé Constituent Assembly, dominated by islamists hastily approved patnáctihodinovém in last night's marathon, partly triggered by concern.
As in previous constitutions, he says, even in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on “the principles of islamic law.”
But what does “principles”?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the islamists this vague wording and the associated legal free space to be used for stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least it illuminates the newly added section: in all matters relating to the sharia, it is necessary to deal with the University of al-Azhar University, which is the most important islamic institutions in the country with a great deal of influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
Not necessarily, but it may mean that klérus will supervise the legislation, which would bring justice any withdrawal of clear-headedness.
In the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation of many
The problem is also that continue to be safeguarded civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship has been in military custody to 11,000 civilians.
Standing in the draft, the State should also protect “the true nature of the egyptian family and promote its morals and values.”
It is legally imprecisely worded so that through this section of the state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language that doesn't mean anything other than censorship.
Indeed, no point in writing to define an explicit equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits slander or defame the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
But it remains unclear what is insulting and how would be prosecuted.
Equally questionable is the wording that is prohibited from “insulting people”.
Only in this case the caricature of a president or a joke at the expense of the experts' rights?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Mursí present for the signing and said they would be “very soon” to present to the Egyptians to popular vote.
“The revolution is back”
Over the past few weeks is forming opposition outnumbered by islamists.
Tens of thousands of people have gathered in the unusual unity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the Constitutional Charter, before it starts to pay.
“The revolution is back and we are going to win,” said Hamdín Sabbáhí, who was in the presidential election set for third place.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said that the draft constitution belongs “to the dustbin of history”.
Through the services of short messages on Twitter followers accused Mursího, that they want a “coup against democracy”.
“If a referendum, we'll go to his palace and overthrow him,” said Yasser Said, a member of the opposition.
“We're tired of the blood of our brothers are not punished,” media quoted egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Several judges announced that they don't want to keep an eye on the referendum, which would become invalid.
“The Koran is our constitution.”
Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood proclaimed vzdorodemonstraci, out of an abundance of caution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer across the Nile from Cairo University.
There were many veiled women and supporters of Salafis, who called: “people are demanding implementation of God's law.”
Called Mursího: “clean country!” and assured: “the Koran is our constitution.”
The fight for supremacy in the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably caused a state of civil war.
This Mursího supporters apparently did not want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now it is time to let the people at the ballot box to decide which direction to go out of the country.
It is regarded as a majority in favour of the proposal by islamists.
“The word “human rights” are not even once.”
The forced constitutional dispute, which should continue until February and integrate all social forces, ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa'da.
Forty-eight human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood in front of the court.
Not because they shared their ideology, but because for him, that human rights are indivisible.
For that he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And in the new constitution now are the words “human rights” even once,” she says in an interview on the “Welt am Sonntag”.
Mursího extension to all three components of the power in the country has forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
“Instead, the president to strengthen civil society, effectively canceled it,” complains Sa'da.
But without civil society organisations democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feel abandoned, and the international community, to be followed by a game of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could easily backfire.
The protestor in Tahrir Square warns: “you created a monster, which you can't control.”
The Norwegian rakfisk: most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
It could be the secret of success of the country associated with the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheese.
Put it in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let this week.
So you can smell the stench of paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest norwegian delicacies.
I was in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is a beautiful view of snow-and the pervasive stench hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is salty fermented trout in the water for up to a year, depending on how much you want to fish stank.
As night falls, and it gets cold, starting with the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet in a festival devoted to this, as they say, preferably nejpodmanivějšímu eat.
“You eat it raw and then it shall zapijete drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called “Rakfisk General”, which is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us, people eat little cubes of fish with a large quantities of alcohol.
“Some people are better than rakfisk aquavit,” says Havard.
The beverage can block out the stench.
A few bits and pieces I'll try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad-it's like a piece of sushi, which has been on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time in Norway, poverty, and because no refrigerator, fish in the autumn dipped into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, pulled and eat-senses are undoubtedly blunt alcohol.
Only a generation ago, there were thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country and looking for work, and they emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly — more than 13% of immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive system of care.
The swedish people, old rival, which was not very long ago, much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, albeit fairly reek of the past.
Among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even when everything is expensive — a small glass of beer or a sandwich you comes to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is the world's reports often does-and it seems that most people like it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, racist, right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, there are people still cite with reluctance.
Instead, it is called a “shooting incident on 22 July.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that, in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the beginning of the 1970s.
“But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,” says at the plate with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and startling blue eyes is a prototype of the Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as most of the english people here, it is absolutely clear.
Nepředvádíme is, we don't like grandstanding.
Norway disposes of its oil wealth very carefully — except for a small percentage of the most money from this sector are invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw money they did not have, the Norwegians were on their purse strings tight.
“While we're skiing in winter and summer hiking, we're happy,” says Anna.
“And eat rakfisk,” she adds with a carefree laugh.
Standing in the snow in front of something to eat-rakfisku already had enough.
The elk burger is something else, and it's nice juicy.
But the evening's smelly fish again here.
The hotel, where I live, is one of the many places where he made rakfisk for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather to smell the most demanding fish.
They have a live television coverage, in which a moderator and a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It's like a singing contest Eurovision.
“What you've got to score the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?”
“This is our scoring Håvard.”
There was applause and laughter.
The man fell from the chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Nieto Pen from Mexico's difficult start
As the incoming mexican president Enrique Nieto Pen prepares for taking office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges we face, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently in a particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, have been erected steel barriers closing several key routes into the capital city, causing chaos on the roads.
But the objective was to prevent dojíždějícím in it, to get to work, but to prevent the protesters' access to the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico's Enrique Nieto Pen will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Faced with a tough task.
Mexico was at the time of the outgoing presidency, Felipe Calderon prospered economically, the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already taken a victim of an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a strong commitment to the mexican people in the reduction in violence,” the president said Pen Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
Proposing a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shook hands with the american president, to Pen Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views on a new leader are different in his old home, populous and vast state surrounding the capital city.
Direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo back on it in a good way.
Citizens were attributed to the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
The city can now travel on one of the new motorways, which left Pen Nieto build. these highways are a huge improvement from a leaky and rough roads, which had been previously.
The board with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the issue of climate change.
“We expect that it will lead to a real and lasting change,” says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of a party president Pen Nieta, the institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
Particularly interesting and we hope for real change in the area of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 of uninterrupted years in power was a party, the PRI, ousted Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the presidential palace, Los Pinos, intra-party from for Enrique Pen Nieta many expected.
And the opposition is refusing to comment about the new president as a man of no substantive content.
It's a very straightforward man, very preoccupied with excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is the impression, former governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad hold, cannot be a contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo clearer.
Tucked away under a motorway overpasses in much like the suburbs of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year had been called in the army to help in managing drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, the wild places beside the huge waste dumps littered with dozens of bodies of murdered women.
At a time when he was governor, Nieto Pen in the State of Mexico killed more than 1,000 women, which is much more than the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez — a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, critics of the Pen Nieta say that during his term in office has failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.
And, in the worst case, his leadership accused of closing one's eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a run-down neighborhood, me Irinea Buendia shows photographs of their dead daughter's Mariana Islands Luna and crying.
According to the official version of Marian committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believed that she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at the house, so it looked as if her body had been washed away,” recalls Mrs Buendia.
There were signs of the strikes and has already begun a posthumous stiffness.
It tells the story of how her mother, Marian looking down from a picture on the wall, next to the cross, which is a single word: “Justice”.
However, this is, as they say in the family, exactly what they have been denied.
State authorities to treat me as if I was the old gossip, a troublemaker and kňouralka.
They want to simply accept what they say, and that's that.
“But it can't be right, when there were so many errors and omissions,” he says.
Sherpa, president of Pen Nieto on Saturday will receive is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised that during its term in office will be his priority.
“I hope that it will be the same as the president, he was a governor,” says in the Valle del Bravo MP PRI Olvera.
However, this is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad hold fears most.
Bradley Manning complained of ill-treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to rebut claims by Bradley Manning on the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on manning's residence in military custody in the town of Quantico in Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of rough treatment with Manningem in prison.
A soldier is charged with the theft of thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein during cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, argued that the records weekly visits that Manning had with officers of the units in the nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not indicate any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of which occurred during a hearing on a defense rejected the case against Manning because of rough treatment in detention period, which in itself is sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that in custody contemplating suicide.
Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during their service in Iraq.
The material was then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never claimed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, through the military prosecutor Fein together with Manningem forms that officers fill after meeting with Manningem in detention facility at Quantico, where he had been since July 2010 to April 2011, to be held in the high security.
Officers Manning asked questions and keeping track of his answers.
When asked by Fein Friday on these forms asked Manning admitted that the treatment by their guards would be evaluated as “excellent” and the overall treatment at the facility would be evaluated as “very professional”.
The forms did not indicate any complaints of ill-treatment, even though the officers manning directly asked about it, how it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said that the concerns relating to the various problems expressed verbally and that officers who visited with him on these concerns have spoken and have indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, failed.
“He wrote “no problems” (after discussed concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't even mention them,” said Manning.
Judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why the treatment with his person complained in January 2011, at a meeting with the Commission examining thoughts of suicide, which a few months ago expressed in the form.
Manning said that in the course of this meeting was his intention to reduce the “prevention of injury”.
The army said that for him the restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance because of suicide) used for the protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted to have guards in custody they knew I was right and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention … to enjoy the high quality of life, as I saw it,” said Manning.
Manning on Thursday testified about his arrest in Iraq and moved to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transported to the detention center at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait considered suicide and once there because of the heat.
It said that he was not able to know what will happen to him and what's going on in the rest of the world, it was very depressing.
“My world has shrunk to only Arifdžán, at the base of the cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die inside the cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, nazouváky, clothes and a pair of glasses.
He said that he was trying to walk, because sleeping or just the camp was in the course of a day against the rules.
Manning said that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
It stated that if the guards could not see his face, when in the middle of the night, he turned to the other side, woke him and he had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Private Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011, has been transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the allegations raised in Thursday's testimony, that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at the time.
Manning said that at the time he was not allowed to hide his blanket.
At Friday's hearing by Judge Manning said that on the orders of his guards decided that a blanket that could cover up to defer, but admitted that his orders for its postponement, no one has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning said last night that he was forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that it is not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the strip of his underwear or his nazouváky to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that the night was removed from his cell in his underwear, his nazouváky and glasses.
His lawyer, hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his detention and that in the event of a conviction in a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense argued that the planned that Manning admits to blame in lesser crimes and that it will fight against the other accusations, because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will argue the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon statement said that Manning was held in accordance with the law on all of those arrested held in custody under maximum security.
Among the charges against Manning is aiding and abetting the enemy, unlawful infliction of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, could be sentenced to life in prison.
My mexican-american identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities that are out there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them through difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says that mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On the last trip to Mexico City, I barely made his way through the crowd and I came into the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
Arrow pointing to one of the two lines: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”) and the other for “Extranjeros” (“foreigners”).
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and all my life I have been called “Mexican.”
It's ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called “irish” and “my friends in New York call themselves as “Italy”.
So later I ended up in the mexican American.”
But this was Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use the symbol.
I was an American.
I speak spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of native speakers and I can't get rid of an american accent.
So I pulled out my american passport and stood in line for “Extranjeros”.
I've been thinking about the moment when this week's newly elected Mexican President Enrique Nieto Pen visited in the White House of President Obama.
On the agenda were the issues that are discussed, as the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pen Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the likelihood that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada, and to create a north american trading bloc similar to the European Union.
And Pen Nieto has promised that he will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States is a complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons over half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who thinks in the range of centuries, no minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after Representative of the United States says something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear in the press and among the elite of the complaints about how Americans would encroach on the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And children Montezumy walks on the warpath.
And yet there is a real challenge for Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are many.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people of the country offers possibilities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And more often than it would appear, this person fit the profile-dark-skinned, poor education, come from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living the american dream, we go to good schools, and we've got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the american dream, not Mexico's.
Our identity can sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently mexican.
Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only to fail.
If our families in Mexico have failed, so it never left.
And we have now found no imprisoned for silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but despite the lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that among Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is tension, because Mexicans more means of who they are, and mexican-Americans resent it.
Even though he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.
And, at the same time, many mexican Americans, you know, feel like part of one.
We love listening to the mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
To obtain the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, we are seen as the Americans.
And in the United States we are considered the Mexicans.
And that relations even more complicated, they want to get some mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reuniting with the Diaspora.
They want to mexican-Americans worked for Mexico as a makeshift “ambassadors” and represented Mexico's interests in the United States.
We should tell our american colleagues, how great is visiting the country and push for political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.
Well.
Therefore, this does not happen again.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
It's only fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how acted with Mexico before a century and a half ago, we must accept the fact that some mexican-Americans still feel indignation for the way in which he has been treated with their families in substantially closer to the past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more “Mexicans” than I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, it was amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza, near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when it seems that Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in its ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, they are caught up in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it will make their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that currently there is much reason for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire reached 21. last November, the fight for this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules in Gaza since 2007, will argue that forcing the Israelis to retreat, while Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million residents of Gaza, in one of the most pitiful and corners of the planet's most populous, with Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its ardent rivals from Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the arab world have gained more influence, so that Hamas has a powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, revived regional power, which was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined on the side of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas, they say that the islamic crescent moon circles around Israel, to the north of Lebanon, which is ruled by a party / militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas' s allies threaten the king.
And, above all, on the southern flank Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous arab country, and the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, secular despot who ruled Egypt in 30 years, until his fall in 2011, he didn't have time to Hamas.
Conversely, the Brotherhood's cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy with Hamas may occur as a player who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.
Instead, israeli hardliners reached opposite conclusions.
In military terms were imposed on Hamas back into the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven their worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better — for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as hard as always. many european countries also to accuse Hamas of starting the latest round of violence.
And, most importantly, Israel had flourished, particularly under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, that the peace process largely ignored.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, it was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall, which extends into the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a palestinian state, and protects the jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality in front of international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party is at the beginning of the campaign for local elections to be held on January 22, teamed up with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they were really ruled on the West Bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, like their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we hold them to the wall and hit them when they poke their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners would win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Even though the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending, higher than spending all his four arab neighbors together.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps new arab governments to recover its economy.
The fact that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, it is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelis also have a situation should look in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination is a barrel of gunpowder, which must one day in areas occupied by Israel explode-as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Currently in the jewish state repression weaken democracy and demographics of this situation even worse, as the arab population continues to grow.
The bloody attacks against Gaza are held every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what makes reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states, where Israel referred to the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside, at least for a little more influence on this matter.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar must commit to stopping the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever before to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state, based on the 1967 borders, with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer virtual statehood at the United Nations.
President Obama also has its share of how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, has failed to show its own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, appears to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.
This is short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the entry into force of the law on cigarette packs ugly
The shabby green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are illustrated warning for smokers and diseased parts of the body.
Entry into force of the australian laws on bad packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors brands have replaced ordinary olive green boxes with a gruesome pictures of diseased parts of the body and the views of children and infants sick as a result of their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and images are compulsory from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes brand names, which are printed in the small print.
This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The australian federal government maintains that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.
He relies on studies that show that when people start smoking at the age of 26 years, is 99% chance that never start smoking.
“Even in very young children, you can see that it understands the message that the tobacco companies try to jointly with their product to sell,” says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting a study which, for example, have shown that children joining the crown in the logo with the idea of it being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies argued that the law will increase trading on the black market, which in turn will lead to cheaper and more abundant cigarettes.
“As a result of this legislation is to have serious unintended consequences,” says Scott of the company's british American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets.
Others argue that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra ha of company Zico import (Ltd, small family businesses, said that the demand for cigarette packaging of silicon used to mask the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the company's british American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost his appeal on the laws of Australia's Supreme Court, has increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that company Zico has sold nearly 6,000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.
This is, for us, a good deal.
As a possible hitch experts argue the popularity of social media in that demographic group, which focuses on the plan.
After a number of australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that the majority of dealers hiding cigarettes from direct gaze, the Tobacco Marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this small space for the promotion of your products, is for you online space a place where you want to be,” says Kim Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman has recorded an increase in the brands on social networking sites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by John “average”.
We must ask ourselves, it's just a private citizen, who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and had this job and created this video, or is involved in the marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the sector has focused on how to deal with the new rules, than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new rules-country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly.
The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek said the government had held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country in 2001 introduced a mandatory warning pictures.
Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia is resisting.
Pictures of me they have no effect.
Simply ignore them.
“You just pull out a cigarette and put back in the box,” says Victor El Hage to buy boxes of photographs of the tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the place King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that, thanks to a single packs for him is harder to settle on the shelves.
“Unloading it took me one hour, now it takes me four hours,” said Yu.
“The government is simply had to totally ban, then we say, “ok, that's it, we close up shop”,” he said, and threw up his hands.
In a world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly had spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems, and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iphone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development is increasingly coming to praise nudění.
They say that for us (and our children) is good, sometimes bored.
It has forced the brain go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And whereas most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have the chance to enjoy the boredom.
Therefore, we should support the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to this.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of greek and roman history at Canada's University of Calgary, who is the author of “Boredom: a lively history (the history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, has a long history of boredom,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found the latin inscription on boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define the boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in a variety of ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After watching the research literature and demonstration of the thoughts of the target group of about 100 people, a professor of Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as experience “I wanted to do something that would have satisfied me, but I wasn't capable of it.”
Boredom from apathy distinguishes it, that person is involved, but she would like to be.
He says that, in the case of apathy, there is no compulsion to do something.
He says that the core of boredom is a “distortion of the process, the attention in a bad mood and feeling slowly running out of time.”
Boredom can remind a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, sees the problem within ourselves.
Sometimes I think we are bored, when we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in terms of attention”, which was published in September in the journal perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article in a magazine.
Some groups have heard loud and related television programme in the next room, others heard it so low that it barely noticed, while a third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard a television programme, reported more boredom than the other two groups — had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed to the problem of boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult task or a lively, can lead to boredom of distraction, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, “as it is finding things wrong on the factory line, distracting music can help with that, to be bored.”
In fact, he said, “we know now that the twisting and drawing, which is often regarded as a sign of boredom, may actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
“Research shows that children who are allowed to stir, with more to learn and keep more information than those who are forced to sit on it,” said Professor Fenske.
All we have ever experienced boredom-delay my flight, the loud speaker, particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s, developed the “scale of susceptibility to nudění” (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale covers issues such as: “a lot of the things that I have to do is repeating itself and is monotonous,” and “I've got so many interests, that I don't have time to do it all.”
Using these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers are, however, generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times daily contact with almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents who reported that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that “adolescence is the heyday of boredom”, which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not being given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So, back to my original question: “is good for you boring?”.
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo an absurd physical risks, playing games or take advantage of addictive substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed merger between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NY.
But the brain is always the best thing you should do.
If you were getting bored and use the energy to play the instrument and cooking, you'll be happy to do it.
If, however, you are watching tv, do you feel good just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, you won't get bored, but learn how to attach itself or self-drive, said Professor Fenske.
And “this separate proceedings are transmitted from one situation to another,” he said.
Your child will learn not only how to attach itself, but gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But nor would it shouldn't be too critical.
Our goal should rather be feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant chatter of the business and technology.
Professor Eastwood said.
“We are accusing it of needs is more boring, but boring is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful,” he said.
What people really are looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy leisure time.
“In an environment in which we constantly přestimulovaní,” he said, “it's hard to find ways to amuse ourselves, as the noise shuts down.”
In Colorado, there is no handbook on the new law on marijuana
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and football player from the southeast Colorado, are facing criminal charges for something that will soon be in the state's legal-for the possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which was used to her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said, that a September day with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the plains, near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After police found marijuana in the car, it was Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use, petty crimes, for which there is a penalty for every $100-and he has been set for the court.
“They treated us like criminals,” said Mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after, Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends answer hundreds of smaller drug cases on the spot rather than on the right.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana is already here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures, repealed.
The Police Department to stop blaming the adult at the age of 21 years of age and older for possession of a small amount of which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.
But prosecutors in conservative districts of Colorado declared that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.
At the same time, a number of cities from the Denver suburbs toward the western mountains voted to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.
“This business is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in the town of it, east of Denver.
The heads of the gossip and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up the licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of-all by the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether for good or bad, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use, and now a recreation.
“Colorado has a regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol in Washington State.
But as Mr Smith said, no place or system cannot do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent for us to follow,” he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, effective from December 6, which also leaves the vacuum, in which there will be a national licensing system, but legal possession of it.
And there are complex mechanical issues during this period must be resolved, such as how to balance the State's “responsible approach” to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
“There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, and particularly in the metropolitan areas of Seattle,” said Ben Livingstone, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently-based research group.
21 November sent police chief Oates of the city it his officers e-mail, in which he announced that the city would no longer prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each person aged 21 years and that the police “with immediate effect” to stop blaming people for these crimes.
The chief Oates said that the police will promote the city's laws regulating growers of medical marijuana, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck stricter.
After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way of pushing for users to seek treatment.
It is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses, crimes at the time they occurred,” said Mr. Buck, in its statement.
The reaction has been complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a joint initiative.
Police in Grand junction, the largest city in the district were adults have been charged for possession of small amounts.
The district attorney, Peter Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all pending cases of possession.
“I don't think that I'm going to lose my time continuing to enforce the law until it is changed,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
For the local prosecutors' s “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organisation for the reform of laws relating to marijuana.
“We spent so much of his life chasing people that still cannot actually accept that it's legal,” he said.
As the first states that a small quantity of marijuana as opposed to alcohol, are Colorado and Washington on a path to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.
Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for regularised sales and at the same time also anxiously waiting for guidance from the federal government, which is still in the plan regarding the sale and cultivation of cannabis for federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana, hope that the Ministry of Justice to cave in.
Despite the arrest of several sellers of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use it to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and the other 16 states in operation.
While drug-enforcement agents are not likely to break down the door to catch a small bag, is likely to oppose allowing the state-controlled business with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on drugs policy administration of President Obama.
Several Colorado cities does not wait for the federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even if it is going to continue for about a year before we will be able to open any trade.
Last week the city of Montrose in the western part of the state has proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.
“We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone will license and then we have a federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against the amendment.
We look at it, what they voted for a municipality, compared to what has happened.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to step down from Oxford, because I'm a conservative.”
His views are accused only of today's college students.
I don't remember ever dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford.
As my father, and my older brother, studied at the university, that I think is the world's largest seat of learning, modern ovíněné greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And yet, at the end of the 1980s, within two weeks of starting at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases and stormed into the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I had opposed the love of students in the next room.
The writer A.N. Wilson playfully said that I left, because I was forced to drink from chipped mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran out.
Yes, I ran away, because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.
I have been persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of alleged enlightenment that was as bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why bring this up until now.
Because, quite simply, that the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students right-of-center suffers from this kind of persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of such students sought the protection of equal rights to gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the association's younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, argues that because of their political views are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and they made clear that they were not welcome”.
Called for a position in the university's Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views are free to communicate.
Their situation didn't help either recently referred to two BBC television documentary entitled “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (wonderland: young, smart and right-wing) about student politics, which conservatives describe as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The program was introduced to graduate Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University-OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and should stick with a silver head.
At other universities conservative students say that's because of the introduction of higher tuition fees is treated as a “scapegoat”.
A 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association nottinghamské University), said Sunday's newspaper, that “left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without having us all together.”
20-year old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is “embarrassing”, while the 19-year-old elected President OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that the approach of JCR vis-a - vis the people the right-of-center worsened.
“It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members,” he says.
During its first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I came in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
A year before the university voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree to the former student, Margaret Thatcher, due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the stalinists shaking with fear.
During the first few days in the opening week, when new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, which should have come.
I discovered that not only professors tacitly approving the needling of conservative students, but with gusto, are also participating.
In the wood-lined classroom led the policy of mining strikes, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture on the french translation of the text from the 18th century to the english language and for what happened, I wasn't ready.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
It's hard enough.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a Slice dough, was a lot of bilious.
“Thatcherovci refuse to learn to speak french, or simply stupid?” he asked.
Other students were sniggering.
Tears in my eyes.
“I suggest in their spare time took some basic lessons in French, so if you're not too busy to social issues,” said Professor Pitt.
Shocked, I returned to my room.
At a dinner in school, I was sitting alone, when I felt a tap on his shoulder.
It was the second year student named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said.
Unfortunately, it's true.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you, it will be even worse.
Most of the conservative first years pretending to be Labour.
Later in a local pub I cravenly tried to pretend otherwise.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proved a failure.
First-year student of philosophy, politics and economics (ironic) went to Eton, he said: “you are the daughter of fascist pig.”
You are infected.
Other students with him notovali.
It was a vicious, dirty.
“How conservatives love?” asked one.
Hitting each other, isn't it?
I felt so as to feel homosexuals in front of liberal legislation of the 1960s.
I could ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
I would have had to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I would have to be converted into labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years before me have developed a purgatory ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor, Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was in my school.
Not only was hated for it, that is a conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy and one of those who write her speeches.
Almost wasn't there.
Instead of the hated for his parochialism and pettiness and for his shift to marxist-deterministickému's view of history.
In 1997, took place at Bilkentské University in Ankara in Turkey.
“You won't be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute from Oxford in her parents' house in London, seeking refuge in their partisan metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that Oxford hate and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford University in the 1940s were accepted by all political opinions.
“But it's the best place in the world,” said pathetically.
It wouldn't do that, not in the city's mood.
Even my communist friends should always perfect ways.
His eyes are clouded.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if she left.
Exhausted by the frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience.
My friend, also a loyal supporter of the Conservative Party, has succumbed to the pressure and abandoned his belief.
The following week in the course of learning, where another professor of history in utter seriousness, he said that was “an enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
Even though I was inside blush with shame, I admitted to me that parents “brainwashed” and I called them “old fogies”.
The relief was only short-term.
Hřebík into the coffin of my career at Oxford beat my father.
At the time he wrote every week into two columns of Murdoch's newspapers.
My door was locked.
I tucked inside, and after five minutes or so of them gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I've never returned.
You can call me a wimp usmrkaným.
But no 18letá girl or boy should not be in an educational institution subject to such intimidation and virulence.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only had 14 conservative prime ministers, but who also has, to date, hiding behind the undeserved reputation as the place with the equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino has elegance rather than fame.”
On the occasion of the exhibition “Valentino: the fashion-making”, which was launched this week in London, spoke with ABC Naty Abascalovou, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszovou and other famous customers italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence Isabella I of England, is the only place in the british capital city worthy of hosting the exhibition Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed it at the start of the celebratory retrospective “Valentino: the fashion-making”, which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by the studio for the last 50 years.
“I love this castle,” he says with his unmistakable italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story, in which the “Il Signor” Garavani single protagonist, but without his honourable clients could be written.
Valentino has always felt enamored of rare and distant world aristocracy.
The first room of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, full of private correspondence and photos with the signatures of the most noble, from Princess Salimy Aga Khan over greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdona.
Valentino exposes those personal memories as trophies of their social rise: from simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy, a paragon of international “bohemian society”.
Like the royal family is not a bad thing.
“They're at least netípnou stub cigarettes to a fine carpets, as do some beautiful celebrities pop-music,” says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino's impressive host and guests enjoy freely and with grace.
“We're all very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in italian,” says ex-wife “Heiniho Thyssena” and is a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelliová or Da Vinci Niarchosová.
“Valentino has always preferred elegance than glory.
And so it is a star.”
Valerio Mazzová demonstrates a Valentine's Day
On his designer forgets or Argentina's model Valerio Mazzová.
“It's been many years since we had a parade in the presence in Rome came to him at a dinner party.
It was twenty of us and among us were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decorations, food, music, in all of this, and I feel his spirit.
Everyone was thanks to him they feel important and loved ones,” says the top model, which began to work with him during the Paris fashion week Summit in 1995.
“I never go out of style, because the proposals are works of art,” he concludes.
A parade of birth
Gravaniho life story is not an obsession, but really opětovaných ones.
He loves the people with good grace and better titles and they love it.
One of the galleries Somerset House had been converted into a 70-meter-long passage, which offers an exchange of roles: the visitor turns out to be a model and marching passages, to watch the “audience” dreams, which is wearing Valentin's masterpieces like the clothes, which she chose Jackie Kennedy at his wedding to Aristotle Onassisem, costume, who wore Monica Vittiová in “night”, or a coat of wool and fur, which belonged to Empress Farah Dibaové.
In the audience, mannequins September names like Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and taxisu, Maren-Marit of Norway, by the bulgarian or Sophie von Habsburg.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients are saying, that the first Valentine's first love, “you cannot forget it.”
“I remember it well.
They were trousers, shirt, vest “gillette” and a jacket from the autumn-winter years from 1971-1972.
It was a gift, which he did for me,” says Naty Abascalová, one of návrhářových muses.
“I give him before the other priority for his femininity and a great love for women, because it highlights our beauty,” added the former Duchess of Ferii.
“I don't like colors, which used a lot, and give the “spark” face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the Princess and fashion icon Patricia Della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how he first put on Valentine's Day.
As a teenager, and lived in Italy, she longed to be underage and have the opportunity to get some of his evening dresses.
At the end of the day, she had received in the late 1990s.
“My first dress from Valentine's Day I bought for the occasion of the celebration of the castle of his cousin, Prince him de Ligne.
They were red gown skirt with ruffles, drape bodice and the top of the off-the-shoulder.
It was a dream that became reality,” says the widow Rodriguovi d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless,” says italian aristocrat, whose life is unfolding between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has saved návrhářovy ceremonial dress “very carefully … because clothes are not just clothes, it is also a set of memories, which are in themselves”.
“The king” of fashion
The centerpiece of the exhibition at Somerset House, a wedding dress, Marie-Chantal Miller from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
To create these ivory-colored silk dress with panels of pearls, 12 different types of lace and trailing a four-and-a - half feet were needed four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the designer called his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkesové, most of the authority of the specialist press, represent these clothes milestone in the fashion of the late 20th century, “the return of clients from high society”.
Valentino dazzled during the years of the elitist “savoir - être” is now the best example.
As Garavani Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honors in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'ordre des arts et des Lettres and decorated of the Legion of Honor, accumulate so many accolades as any of his clients.
“My attention always attracted its quality, quiet, neat and perfect appearance,” acknowledges the Princess d'Arenberg.
“The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
A perfect time to leave any trace.”
When it says the princess.
The hardest job in the world: medium sulphur in the area of the volcano Kawah Ijen
In four of the euro in the indonesian volcano gamble of his life and health, while putting 70 kilos of sulphur down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom it is their job, and there are those who are working in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners, who earn their living from the conquest of the sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day fárat until the bottom of the crater, where escape the sulfur gases from the interior of the country and on contact with air passes into a solid state.
After tough large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, takes them on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets of steep stone paths.
At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it's just 250 metres, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes to rise tortoise pace up, because maintaining balance and thoroughly reflected its steps to neuklouzli and fall into the abyss.
They know that any misstep might cost him his life, how it happened one french turistce, years before they collapsed from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur, which earns
When they are on top, making their way around the tourists who took photographs of them, as if they were in a circus, and wearily carrying heavy baskets to scale mining company ranked slightly below, at an altitude of 50 metres.
This is a firm PT friend Ngrimbi, which in this volcano has benefited from 1960 and never pay their workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (five cents) for a kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in the day-to-day life and is used for the production of matches, amusing, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.
“Because they are commonly worn by 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million) in any way,” says us anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One way it takes three hours, and at the end of it is destroyed, but he can then earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 million) per day.
Even when it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what he earned in the field.
“The daily wage of miners here is very high. for example, the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees ($1.2 million) per day and salary in a fortnight's time is two million rupees (167 million),” explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 million) a day, and the work was so severe, but anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for good reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as sulphur: “I'm married with a young girl from Bali, which is Hindu, and I took her to Java, to convert to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, it's hard to breathe, still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
In its 27 years of anto three times a day he's risking his life in a volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur, it began to take its toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, it's hard to breathe, still coughing and sore eyes, toxic gases to escape from a volcano.
That is the price he must pay for it, to achieve his dream.
“I am going to work for two more years, because I want to open a store or studied spanish or french,” promises more than passable English.
This charming and intelligent young man in a fate could be a tourist guide, the waiter or manager in the hotel, and instead of doing the work of carriers.
Shares of dirty wooden hut with other carriers and every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur night keeps coming out and its distinctive yellow color varies in blue and glow in the dark.

About 400 of the rules on the shoulders of the basket with sulphur from the bottom of the crater

He did not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 million) from a surcharge on photography, which, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees ($1.2 million) relating to the natural park from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for cattle, and not for the people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year old carrier, who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left school.
 Can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that he would work “as long as possible”, because he needs money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turn, trapping the miners in thick fumes from volcanoes are based, the miners are so tough, none of them complaining that suffers from serious illnesses … but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems into arthritis, pain in his knees and wounds caused by the weight of baskets on their shoulders.

Time passes, but the continuing misery, one of the biggest trades in the world remains from generation to generation-craft engaged in human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore's babies, to save the economy
Singapurci waged that do not have children, career, stress and the cost of living and education.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow up.”
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you're a patriot. carry out our civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan for lifesavers, but despite-or perhaps because of-the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints of “put a cake in the oven” as a mockery of the birthrate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BUT, who created the video, hopes that this advertising will be able to draw attention to the problem of humorous manner.
The artistic director of the Agency's Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to fulfill their “civic duty”.
“This is entirely a matter for the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the world's worst in our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which we have to touch.
We knew that the Government has decided to try a lot of things like extend perfumes with pheromones or organize a cognitive functions.
Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing, such as the composition of the rap, in order to resolve this problem.”
1.2 children
The who's taken too lightly, it is the government of Singapore.
A year spent 1 USD 300 to encourage people to have more children.
The government's package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars for a child, extending maternity leave and the allocation of the financial benefits.
All these measures, but had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technologies in south-east Asia, also known as conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate has exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a restoration of peace, in 1976.
Why, in fact, Singapurci have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the marriage and the family of the National Authority for the population, says that it is because of “better education” and “a wide range of career opportunities.”
“The people that are available to a wider range of options in terms of the objectives and priorities, it's not only the marriage and the family,” he says.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. the result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While in the context of immigration policy, there have been efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the population decline, among the local population that has caused resentment.
Some of Singapore's Web site, is to see the overt xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who have been criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integrate.
Immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year recorded a governing party Singapore its worst election result since the start of independence.
After the election, appeared to deal with the problem by using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unintended consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health, and the politics of immigration, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to get as many small brick home.
For example, began to affect the real estate business.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as the “shoe box”, which could be built in certain urban areas.
These flats are area 46 square meters and have great success in marketability.
However, there is concern that they may support a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers, to build a large single-family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the developers El Developers, arguing that their “shoe box” sold far more quickly than larger houses.
“They are popular, and so that will be sold on the days and weeks faster than houses with greater size.
Therefore, for our cash flow is much better.”
But to admit that the new standards set clearer rules for developers, who were previously limited, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much on edge
Singapore is a city-state.
Although the new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate, the nation's conversation with Singapurci workers in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will have a big effect.
“People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, that many people put off,” says the young officer.
“The rest of them are children.
But it's important for me to rely on their own time and money,” said another, a 20-year-old boy.
Men and women cite career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So let the government seeks to citizens in any way forced to have children, they are all ultimately Singapurci, regarding the creation of a family who have the last word.
What's private is private online and offline
Privacy.
According to the dictionary, published by the Royal Spanish Academy is about something that is personal in nature, or the “area of private life, which has every right to protect against any disruption”.
What's privacy for people under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Means danger, which is produced when published on the Internet, which would certainly not in the day-to-day communications say?
Journalists from elPeriódico spoke to five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four of the cases considered the concept of privacy for “something entirely his own” on a personal level and as a “user name and password” when they were on the social network.
“My biggest secrets would publish,” says a 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger's accounts for the past two years.
“It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world,” he says.
“I'm pretty pictures on FB or photos, how we play.
He also says there are known.
I share the picture, which would not be my picture, or that anyone would ridicule,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, photographs of naked people or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all the 35 friends on FB and its nine fans on Twitter.
Most of the relatives.
Among them: a mother who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
“I opened an account on Twitter, to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if somebody tells me there is only so I give,” he added.
“Social networks are amusing, I can speak with relatives who are far more quickly or to communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
No one would have cared if he had been recommended by a stranger.
The 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager's own accounts on the network of Hotmail, Facebook, we Space and Ask and at last the network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from their lists of friends.
“I don't have fear, because we have something in common, such as music,” he says.
According to the boy, he was not one of them didn't instruct, nor did they want to address or telephone number.
“If me or that I wanted simply to be removed from your account,” she says.
José volunteered to Ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boys are not foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
“Famous friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was,” confirms.
The victim, according to Jose check out of your account.
“I'm just going to activate the private system.”
Then a series of steps, explains how the bill safely set.
Unlike Jorge this boy published photos of known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
“Of course I would have done it if somebody didn't like or don't like it.
Even though I know that it's direct,” he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, english teacher and graduate business education and teaching, considers that to children and adolescents in social networks correctly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
States that: “the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but as the social network, has changed the rules of the game.”
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article, digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people, who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, who need to learn, and they themselves are learning to do,” he says.
He explains that it is a difficult subject, “because we are asking them to recognize what is appropriate to publish and distribute, say, and what did not, in an age when we are not yet ripe.”
Also to be-to-slow, at a time when what they most want is a popular, have thousands of friends and think about the consequences,” he says.
According to the engineers is the most efficient way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions, which is forcing us to think.
“Tell them to do something, it doesn't work,” he adds.
Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that would tell a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or: would you like it if someone has published a picture of you as you published his?
You know, what about you other published?
When you call the person in the photos of the celebrations, did you ask these people to leave?
And one more: they need to keep all know, what are you doing now?
Another point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
“People outside of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and the same should be on social networks,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant explains, it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If you understand the intricacies of every single, have a good basis to talk with children about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet can be.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish it,” he says.
 Guardia is of the view that it is essential to remind children of the traditional rule of “Don't talk to strangers.”
The summit of the South American ends and the Lima Declaration was published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without issued a statement from Lima, which was given advanced notice, which was signed in the presence of seven presidents.
The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed by the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and presidential office, who at the beginning of the set, that document published at the end of the summit, said that was later published on the website of the peruvian government.
Furthermore, they argued that the contents were published by peruvian President Ollantou Humala in a few short press statements.
Journalists have throughout the summit's limited access to information.
During the negotiations, in the press room transmitted video from the presidential meeting without sound, the report “confidential meetings, designed to prevent the transmission of sound”.
A small amount of information that should be available to journalists, was given a press spokesmen of some governments, who have been meeting here, but not the peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the negotiations, a list of participating presidents, which provoked the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who have asked for more information.
Later sent to the peruvian presidential office media e-mail was “a final declaration” from the summit, but it is just an expression of President Humaly, and not an official document, which the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru's third summit of south american and arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and not on this occasion was originally promised the Lima Declaration published, even though it was the press eagerly required.
On the official website of ASPA may find that the document was published last Tuesday.
The two international meetings to the peruvian authorities to ensure broadcasts for all journalists, but completely stop the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to the judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which deals with the border dispute between the two countries.
President Ollanta Humala of Peru and Chile's President Sebastián Piñera meeting during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing defence speech to deal with both sides of the conflict, which was initiated by Lima against Santiago.
“Are we going to be and do a ruling to settle the dispute, which today in this international court dealing with,” the president said Humala, together with his chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law and the peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” said Piñera and greeted President Humala handshake with flags of both countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents, to be subject to a decision by the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week by bogotský pact, which has expressed its commitment to the judgments of the international court, which ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, Colombia, and this decision was deemed to be completely wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay has been excluded from the organisation of Unasur in 2011 following an appeal by the then President Fernando Lugo and did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for starting the morning speeches and the outcome of the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document in which informed that it had taken 16 agreements and was scheduled to work on 31 projects between the south american countries, with investments amounting to 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the adopted agreements mentioned that member countries of Unasur will take “important steps towards the goal, in the form of a south american citizenship, which is circulated in the residence”.
Informed that are backed up by action to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to better access to drugs and low-cost Internet in all corners of South America and the common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters”.
When Europe is in crisis, “does not have the economic consolidation (Latin America) winning the substance, but is intended to extend our productivity and to show our people a better future,” said Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects which will improve transport links to various places in South America, especially in rural and border areas … so that our countries were better integrated and creating new economic ties,” he said in a speech čteném peruvian president.
Mention that five of these projects to Peru and the area its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two are related to better link with Ekvádorem, did not, however, give more details.
The final document will also touch on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to her return to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues to the summit, was to highlight the need for Latin America remain prosperous and peaceful areas, which is solid and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, said colombian President Juan Manuel Santos before its participation in the regional meeting that he hopes that on Saturday in Mexico will meet with the nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, with respect to discuss the ruling by the International Court of Justice on the dispute on the maritime border, which is disputed by Bogotou.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) will meet with President Daniel Ortega,” said Santos.
“We will look at all the solutions are not excluded, no contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country,” he said.
“I hope that I will be able to say to the President Ortega, who led the negotiations more civilized and kindest possible form,” said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they were to attend the inauguration of the country's president Enriqueho Peñi Niety.
At the summit, the EU defence ministers provisionally met to approve a plan of action for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defense of the area.
Members of the organisation of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam, Paraguay, though that the country is currently excluded.
Peru's temporary chairman of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the objective, in which “South America, in this case we really must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who was part of the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state tv that the Europeans “Perú, was killed in World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now they are virtually one country”.
In this sense, defended the project for the creation of a south american citizenship, which member countries of Unasur support.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any south american country, which is already underway between the members of the Andean Community, however, there are still backward areas that they want us to go back to the past,” he said.
Ecuador's president, among other things, that agrees with the reformation of the Organization of American States (OAS), on the condition that it will reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
“Those who are in the lead, never to be binding, and the South Americans, on the other hand, we all signed up.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission in Washington, D.C., financed by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted to Ecuador, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa has confirmed that this decision regrets because he had betrayed his principles and respect for its “deep democratic values and human rights”.
Added to that, at the time, “there is reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country, irrespective of the ongoing process”.
In addition, criticised the swedish justice, who asked him to take on swedish territory underwent questioning about alleged sexual offence, while “own swedish legislation allows you to carry out the questioning of videoconferencing call, which could take place from the ecuadorian embassy in London”.
Correa has said that there is a risk that, in the case of Assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and psychological health.
“I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but Ambassador informed me that my small lung problems, but nothing serious,” said ecuadorean head of state.
“However, the possibility that his physical and psychological state worse because it is locked up in a small space with no possibility of movement in the open air.
It would have affected the health of each,” he said.
President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in Quito, the embassy in London, on the basis of authorization, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, and pointed out that the London talks were held in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
“We are not negotiating with regard to human rights, such a word in this case we use, but still continued talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, because Assangeův lawyer Balthazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various european instances,” he said.
Saying that “if the United Kingdom will pass tomorrow, it's all over.”
And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears in Quito, the embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the problem without the legislation, as has been done in other cases, tomorrow there will be this problem by the end.”
Correa has taken advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and to make it clear that certainly does not tolerate “podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, which undermines freedom of expression”.
The biggest enemy of a free press is not us, the mean-spirited and evil politicians, but a bad press in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, expressed joy at the fact that no such journalists, “neither bankers nor a hegemonic country and not the bourgeoisie with Ecuador”, and said that, if re-elected, “will continue in the changes by the right way and in the right direction”.
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto by Paraguay on membership of the Unasur, at least until its next election, arguing that the whole “must be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and pučismus wrapped in legality”, because in fact “destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
In addition, the ecuadorean president said that is “totally appropriate” the wishes of his colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the aftermath of the judgment of the International Court in the Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
“It's a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.
It is to be assessed carefully, in order to overcome and was able to go forward.”
Also expressed hope for a settlement of the dispute over maritime borders, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that “it is for Latin America the right to seek international appeal, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, whatever it may be, no matter how hard.”
In connection with the possibility that he may run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to make a serious bid for a third term of office, said that he sees the possibility of “with a great deal of optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult.”
Correa said that if in February 2013 loses the elections, retire from public life.
“I personally never cared much, but so unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, may be correct only political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who ensures that likely victory, then we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
“If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term, and then I walked away from politics.
If we lose, I'm going to do the same thing.
I've already decided,” he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez to Cuba.
“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chavez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the health of the president,” he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended by calling for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality, and security.
AIDS victims are today due to late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results of his test: HIV-positive.
“It was as if to me was struck by lightning,” says the memory of the moment of truth, the doctor tried to “softening”, but apparently without success.
The boy's family before holding.
He decided to take his illness itself onto their shoulders and began to communicate it. and with such dedication that he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the earliest patients units of HIV in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara (my H), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.
It's not the director of the clinic the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) farewell, “because it was cut.”
When AIDS have been synonymous with death.
Now it is possible with this syndrome survive and fully live.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about his illness and they come when the virus caused the destruction of the body's immune system and the conflict in himself, and then they become victims of accidental infection.
31 years since the world has AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, “it is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who in a timely and appropriate manner, starting with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the unit of HIV in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara, that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability, the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, the better it is for those who use drugs: people with 200 cells 400 can live up to 30 years and people with 400 to 500 cells for 50 years.
Simply put, this means that those who have been diagnosed with HIV in 25 years, according to these findings “in compliance with treatment live without problems up to 75 years,” he said in an interview with the doctor.
To highlight this progress, it should be noted that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearbook the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS, UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of the patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year, 187. however, since 2005 to ensure universal access to antiretroviral therapy.
 - Why people continue to die on the consequences of the disease?
 “It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
As I see it, this is happening to us in the hospital.
For at least the past 12 years we have not run out of medical supplies. the problem is that patients are coming at a very late stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease.”
Adds a compelling figure: “nine out of ten patients coming in, if we're going to show some associated infections. all that needs to be done in order to have more influence on the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier and, therefore, it should be on a large scale to offer testing for the disease to all persons who requests it.”
In its proposal coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who had come to do tests to private laboratories, just because he did it to his friend, and despite his young age with him for outbreaks of disease AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, also suffered from cancer, which is one of the most common complications.
“Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some might think that they were going to die, and they don't want to know more.
“If I have to die, I'd rather be vyřádím three times a week,” they say, but that is not the case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, medication.”
Today, his parents knew only that he was suffering from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to themselves and to the other person,” lists Fabrizio, who has taken up the challenge to share its experience with the diary MILENIO Jalisco to today in the World AIDS Day was motivated by his testimony to those who are worried.
“Whatever they do tests. if risk, so let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, it's better. and if you have been diagnosed, they realize that they can live like anyone else, when they will be held accountable.”
This sums up the message of his battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar guadalajarský journalist who reveal information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps in prevention.
In places, which is dedicated to this task “is actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us the packages, as well as hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms,” he said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.
“What do you want to do it?” is the question of full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and medical staff, the teenagers want to avoid, the reporter says.
He suggested this inefficient distribution change. whether condoms are not only behind counters, but the hundred or so is located in dávkovačích public toilet, in places frequented by young people.
“It's not promoting promiscuity.
It's not that they “pay and the beer,” said Governor Emilio González, when asked if he agrees with the distribution of condoms in his district.
Takovásexualita. it is best to make condoms to those who had sexual habits,” he said.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of HIV / AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This state of affairs is in fourth place in New Mexico and cases of AIDS and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease progresses through sexual contact, 6% of blood through y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that with the HIV virus can live for about 50,000 people, since on the one established case is four to five people who don't know about the disease.
The judgment by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company's bankruptcy in vitro by Mexico, causing disastrous precedent for any national enterprise with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
So, it seems that the practices of corporate restructurings, which allow mexican laws in the country lanes and stars in defiance of international agreements.
Approval of the decision by 15 June last year the judge Harlinem Hal in bankruptcy court for North Texas' practice of mexican firms with no defense against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the mexican producers of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.
To begin with, it must be said that, while the judge this case contends that the creditors have to obey the law of the United States, the Court of Appeal the fifth district, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides the insolvency proceedings in Mexico.
For one thing, it would suggest a lack of international legal cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational companies.
In fact, for this purpose, the law created a model of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which specifies the arbiter of the organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that vote without branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company in vitro to branches, had not reached the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility of mexican laws allow.
The fact of the matter is that the case was the first in vitro company, which was adopted this scheme.
There are a half-dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose transfer debts guaranteed federal bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of branches, creditors-who vitro stood against the company in a court of law in the United States, i. e. the funds “vultures”, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited-achieved a majority.
In the vote would have reached about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take into account the decision of the Court of Appeal.
From another perspective, accuses the company of in vitro from the difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 — against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm Gonzalez set to appeal to the new assessment directly to the Court of Appeal that the examination was carried out with the full participation, with the participation of the five judges, because originally voted in only three.
If this does not succeed here, will require a revision of the appeal process more instances of, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent by the mexican government as the amicus curiae, which is described in detail in vitro procedure of the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company was eased by the beginning of the agreements signed by both countries, to confronted the act with chapter 15 Insolvenčního Act of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country is complying with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantees equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: punishment for a company in vitro and the state.
The overall assessment

Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “basketball was my life.”
The basketball world traveler Héctor “Hetin” Reyes was with this Salo's sport linked more than 60 years and has traveled to the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories on the history of the local basketball, as has the Héctor “Hetin Reyes.”
Reyes has been before him in 2008, attracted by a stroke in a wheelchair, dedicated to the sport after more than 60 years, whether as a player under the age categories, a player in the National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the National Basketball League, or president portorické Basketball Federation.
“I was in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time as I was when I was in the 1990s, the president of the National League, general manager of BSN national team and the chairman of the federation,” said Reyes when visiting reporters newspaper Primera mountain at their home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes in his statement wasn't exaggerating.
The wall of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenir of his long career, show it.
At the heart of the Bayamón
With the greatest affection from all those guards, reminiscent of his tenure in Los Vaqueros since the mid-1950's, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time celebrated 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.
“It was my best years that I had enjoyed, because I had the opportunity to be with the team, los Vaqueros since 1967, participate in eight championships, either as the owner, the co-owner, or the coach.
This was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I had one playoff game farewell — in 1981, when he made his debut in BSN Jerome Mincy.
Then the team took “Cuco” him, which was an excellent leader,” said Reyes.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach and then worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me: “I want you to make a 6-foot player.
Do you want it?”
And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.
Bartow me then recommended the ball Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember that said that if Mincy Bayamonu will bring victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to the further.”
The championship, where the team played for Los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance, as in 1988 has pursued as President of Basketball Federation.
In that time, he wanted to fully devote their functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
“I remember when we first defeated the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we are, but we have a bronze if it weren't for the canadian referee, who let us repeat final face-off,” said Reyes.
A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you ever saw?
It is among the best, as well as the one that defeated the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we're the guys trounced the United States, which was very similar to that which we blew a bronze at the World Cup.
The team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona RIVAS, Fico Lopez and “Piculína” (him), but there were also teenagers (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, who couldn't be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.
The team, which might not be perfect, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, the men were from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in argentine Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, as were “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced player ruled out because of a clash in panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions we won gold.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín him.
The number of international tournaments, are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level of such results as Piculín.
Not to mention his involvement in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best coach of the Puerto Rican?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The young, I very much like the work Leo Arilla.
His success in the Federation consider the greatest?
That was part of the era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s was the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What you didn't get a chance to prove it?
There are things I wanted to put in place, such as the division of youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island in a national playoff.
Now a lot of travelling and playing too many games, which is not necessary.
I can also see a benefit in mandatory certification and training courses for coaches, referees and assistant referees.
I am pleased about that.
What is now considering?
Most of all I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I'm enjoying my grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

But it was only in the form of a masterly performance Hangmanův incredibly repellent J.R., which led him to the top.

The promotional slogan “who shot J.R.?”, which was intended to raise expectations about work full of emotion, when Hangmanova figure almost murdered, caused not only an enormous number of speculation viewers around the world, but also the risk-taking millions of dollars in sazkových offices.

Starts on the course, which examines the “end of the world”
Each week, students studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When a religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester's course about the end of the world, knowing that it's irresistible temptation: the end of “a number of” the mayan calendar, which has come December 21, caught many people as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call the “Armageddon” debt, and the growing conflict, in which Israel is involved, the place where, according to Christian teoretizujících about the end of the world will begin the apocalypse.
“I didn't realize this would be nejapokalyptičtější semester there ever has been,” said Charmé this week students Rutgersovy University in Camden, New Jersey.
When the man finally, what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, it's a really good time.
And remember, that is bad for the apocalyptic-minded good.
And that's not the only professor, which offers courses on the “end of the world” in this semester, which is, in theory, the latest in history.
At Temple University hosting Assistant Barry Vacker course “resources, culture and the end of the world”.
Each week, students studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We have been discussing these ideas with the time expanding,” he says, and both offer a hypothetical scenario, which is governed by a human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material can get into the hands of terrorists, the war could erupt.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how it differs from the examples from real life.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, possible and impossible,” says Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, was put together by a professor of latin american history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, to hold a course with a simple name for the end of the world.
“Nepřipojujeme “2012”, because we always expect, with the possibility of a course again in the event that the world will not end,” said Restall.
Despite the “impending doom” to students to study, develop projects and do the final exams.
On Penn State's final test is to take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which makes students with no option but to work “until just before nightfall predicted the end of the world,” said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
“Expanding into two hours,” said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which has claimed 35.
For weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mail questions whether it is still place.
The students themselves to assure themselves that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort ourselves,” she said at Rutgers University in Camden 23letá Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And so the apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs, it is only a matter of comfort, or the lack of it.
Will Wekesa, 25 year-old student of psychology and nursing, he said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I'd never heard of the hour at which it could teach,” he said.
“I am enjoying it.”
But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a professor, said that he believes in the end date of December 21.
“Our first project was about the mayan prediction, and in some ways we are disproving it,” said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
“The Mayans never foreseen for the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar,” said Restall.
But he added that in western culture is an apocalyptic anxiety, which goes back centuries in which people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.
The flowering of this speculation caused by the Internet.
“The rest of the people,” he said.
It is overwhelmingly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, which puts this year in the Philippines, on the question of whether there knows about a course on the “end of the world”, he answered quickly.
“The Philippines is not the end of the world,” he wrote, and suggested an exemption for the highest office.
We have a reprieve from the Pope.
Restall said that over the years has been talked about for many days at the end of the court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, “people will begin immediately to think about the next day” or philosophical, that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, at the end of which the world is extinguished.
The date of the take lightly the students and professors.
Several of them said that they intended to go to the “end of the world”.
“I think I'll call a few friends to laugh together,” said the 20-year-old student communication Samir Ford.
