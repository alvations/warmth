Food debt at European inflation
Principal reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone are the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was higher in November than expected - after the 2,6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate was registered by 3.1 per cent, how the statistic office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports.
Official prognoses proceeded from only 3 per cent, announced Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) did not lower the Leitzsins. After their discretion the rising rohstoffpreise and the easy decrease of unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral would favour the reduction of the rate of interest.
The EZB is anxious, the inflation rate under two per cent to keep at least scarce or at the two-per cent mark.
According to an analyst be the EZB in the dilemma: One must "agree upon" the inflation, in order to exclude later action need.
With 3,3 per cent the inflation rate reached a twelve-yearly record high in November in Germany; in Spain climbed the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 per cent.
For the rise of the inflation in the euro zone the risen food and energy price are responsible.
The MATIF Weizennotierungen rose by 88 per cent, and the course for soy beans reached likewise a record high since 1973.
Also with food oil and milk products there was a substantial price increase in 2007.
The world price for crude oil rose in this year by 52 per cent - in the past month the cost per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 US dollar.
According to the EZB the inflation will rise in the year 2008 of 2,1 to 2,5 per cent, however one counts 2009 on a decrease on 1,9 per cent.
For the coming 3-4 months analysts proceed from a 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate, number the annual average rate however with 2,1 per cent.
For 2008 experts count on the fact that the EZB will twice lower the interest.
Gallup locates cabinet crisis
After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz sympathizers to at the beginning of of Decembers grew substantially. Erstmal since 2002 has the party the largest basis camp, while the agreement for the socialists achieved a tiefpunkt of 13 per cent, dagewesenen ever, according to Gallup.
With the party-faithful voters the difference precipitates clearly owing to the high determination of the opposition proponents: More than two thirds (71 per cent) face fifth (20 per cent) agreement for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: They come in the total population on two per cent.
The number of party voters grew in both bearings by a per cent.
In the comparison to the last tiefpunkt the general economic tendency continued to worsen - the portion of those, which judge the economic situation of the country as "expressed badly", was so high never before (41 per cent), while they regard further 46 per cent "rather bad" as.
After hope-fuller prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year the majority of the population counts on a further degradation of the situation; only one tenth proceeds from an improvement.
In December an accomplished Gallup inquiry resulted in the fact that 71% of the asked ones - a historical high - which as "rather badly as quite" judged work of the prime minister.
Thirteen per cent of the asked ones have large confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the portion of the proponents for Viktor Orbán constitutes 38 per cent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the party chief of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political tendency is the number of those, means, one could get the discontent with the Prime Minister also without changes of government into the grasp.
After unrests in past October still if 35% for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government had expressed themselves, this portion amounts today to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees the solution only in new elections.
For their interest in the popular vote it answered asked 60 per cent that they participate "with security" would deliver, and further 20% their vote "probably".
To the comparison: if the parliamentary elections would take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent "with security" to the urns would go, further 15% regard its participation as "probably". In view of these tendencies the result of the popular vote would be foreseeable.
74% would be correct against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day money.
Put down on the group at the popular vote "with security" participation became the portions of the opponents of the studies -, practice and hospital fees even of the 81, 84, and/or. 89 per cent amount to.
Auchan most expensively, Tesco increases by nearly a fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaoerser commercial area maintained also this yearly the average price increase of 16% from the last year, with the difference that there was this yearly no increase of the value added tax.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaoerser commercial triangle increased the price of the usual Weihnachtskorbes of the "Napi" also this yearly by 16 per cent, however in all hypermarkets price increases were registered of over 1.000 HOOF.
After the prices are "away-galloped" in the food markets in past December, the price increase failed prozentuell not drastically, compared with the anyway high, earlier output level.
However it affects the consumers certainly deterring that that, for which they had paid in the last year still well under 9.000 HOOF is available this yearly not even for 10.000 HOOF.
The price of the "Napi" of warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze by at least 91 HOOF in the examined markets.
The highest price amounted to 10,573 HOOF.
(in 6800 the price was with 6.800 HOOF.)
The prices for Unicum and alive fish remained almost to previous year level, strongly rose however the prices for Putenbrustfilets, nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary, with Auchan gave it however to 1kg bread waking for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-conditioned collapse of prices on under 200 Forint with the product.
The price two litres of a Coca Cola pledge bottle of under 200 Forint was likewise surprising, thus cost here the beverage inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF.
This yearly in the "Napi" nevertheless cut most expensively, and Cora to goods basket comparison off Auchan most favorably.
Our computations resulted in that Cora the prices in the "Napi" warenkorb opposite the Weihnachtspreisen in the past year around 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased in each case by 18 per cent.
The difference between the cheapest warenkorb of the previous year and the most expensive heurigen yearly amounted to 12%, while the increase between cheapest warenkorb of the past most yearly one and most expensive of the current yearly constituted 21%.
The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF.
The average price increase still was in the previous year about 1.206,00 Forint, however the value added tax increase became apparent with the prices to last Christmas.
Exactly this procedure met the trade badly: Apparent the department stores could not decide so quite, which price margin them with the individual articles to use to be supposed, since the effects of the price increase were unpredictable on the consumer behaviour.
(if the dealer the peripheral speed of a product badly plans, can he around substantial profits fall in the price margin, according to the traffic intensity arranges themselves.)
Mehwertsteuer caused the price increase of the "Napi" of warenkorbes failed in the past year in such a manner radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the difference in prices amounted to with the cheapest basket only 844 Forint.
This yearly such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost more around 1.630,00 Forint, as in the previous year, and even with the cheapest there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint.
In the comparison of the two last Weihnachtssaisons a catastrophic price increase, the price of the daily consumer items showed up in the hypermarkets in as 20 months around more than 30 per cent less rose.
(this again does not confirm necessarily the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary: With some basic food the statistic office in the period of 12 months determined one more than 30-prozentige price increase.
So in for instance beside flour also with eggs.)
If one throws however a view into the "Napi" to warenkorb, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already in the previous year expensive product rose even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position, than the Eilieferanten - nevertheless they could shift the drastic price increase upon the multis.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not deplore themselves; It is reported constantly by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look no more on the prices.
From all large quantities are bought, durable food go into pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning gave it in all three department stores endless queues with the cash, when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported, so that many multis deplore themselves with the public opinion analysts, it could not even the planned conversion achieve, not only with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.
In many places at disinfectants one saves
This year more than thousand infections in hospitals were registered, which were to due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.
The hygenic conditions in the hospitals, the overflow of the beds, the overload of the personnel - all factors, which are not detrimental to damming the infections straight, so the leading lady doctor of the national epidemiology center.
In many places also with the disinfectants one saves.
In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital recently an MRSA infection was diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, who was in-supplied after a heavy accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the yearly there was here already a similar infection.
The hurt one of a heavy car accident became from the hospital to dismiss, a little later had the man however with an MRSA infection to return. An important operation could not be accomplished since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the body of the patient, yet.
Until 10 December of this yearly from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant exciters released infections were announced to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading lady doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Boeroecz.
So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security, the dark number might be however higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were released by the MRSA, that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries for instance a third of humans in its nose, without it would cause an illness.
SA-CONDITIONED infections (as for instance neck inflammation, almond inflammation, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react usually well to antibiotics, it are well welfarable.
If the means are however too highly proportioned or used inappropriately, antibiotic-resistant from that well respondierenden bacteria, which spread under appropriate conditions in the hospitals fast, develop.
In particular with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune system, in addition, in older, or patients with small body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, as for instance for Wundinfektion or blood poisoning, thus Sepsis.
The medical director/conductor of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belongs to the patient house everyday life.
One may not confound the infection with the epidemic disease, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA gives it only not, where she is not looked for.
Resistant to antibiotics
"such patients are isolated, the maintenance personnel carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply, and we have Tibor Nyulasi the antibiotics" necessary for the treatment - in such a way.
Examined during their admission in the hospital will the patients on MRSA, an infection can not be nevertheless always avoided.
Samplings too rarely
The majority of the infections in hospitals, released by MRSA, would be avoidable, however the at present dominant conditions and circumstances were unfavorable for the containment of the emergence or the propagation of the multi-resistant exciter, say Karolina Boeroecz.
After this infection predominantly occurs in hospitals and old people's homes, the hospitals should examine the in-supplied patients and MRSA infected to isolate immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals the micro-biological sampling however so frequently one does not practice.
Not least because there are of sides of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation.
Most cases would come therefore only then to the daylight, if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical chief of the epidemiology center.
In addition, Vonseiten of the European union gives it strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humanmedizin, it gives in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease pictures.
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful, i.e., micro-biological investigations are necessary, so that no resistance can form against the means, however this directive by hospitals are also not always kept.
Under the ambulatory, or itself in the basic supply patient present is micro-biological samplings even still more rarely, like that Karolina Boeroecz.
One saves with the disinfectants
Scientific proofs prove that MRSA will transfer from a patient to the other one most frequently from the maintenance personnel.
Straight one therefore comes to the hand washing, or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however there are substantial lack in the hospitals also in this area.
MRSA will transfer the infected patient by droplet infection or contact, in the domestic hospitals does not exist however always the possibility, to isolate.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, those beds scarcely together gereiht, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view.
How Karolina Boeroecz continues to mark, it seems unfortunately in financially less the hospitals well placed even that with disinfectants is saved, it gives few male nurses, many patients - all to factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are there as can be prove far less frequent, and/or can be stopped the further spreading of the exciter, where these preventive measures are kept, so Karolina Boeroecz.
Government program against MRSA
MRSA infections into the grasp to gotten causes for the health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are everywhere fought.
In England for example the vorbeugung by MRSA, and/or its containment was held in the government program.
After first signs the program is successful - like published data occupy, is declining the tendency of the MRSA infections in England.
The European center for disease prevention (ECDC) the vorbeugung of the emergence of multi-resistant exciters (under it also MRSA), as well as the vorbeugung of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities explained.
Death steering wheel police head was not drunk
In the case of the police head XXII. District of caused car accident with fatal outcome now the official appraisal is present.
Meanwhile withdrawn the police head XXII. District, which killed a pedestrian on Tuesday with a car accident, was neither alkoholisiert, nor under drug influence, Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapester senior public prosecutor shank said on Friday, after the official appraisal was submitted to the case.
The appraisal confirmed the results of the Erstuntersuchung, according to which the police head had not consumed alcohol, before he sat down to tax.
The former police head bent with his own passenger car in XXII. District into the Kossuth Lajos road and has thereby 55 a year old man over-drives, who crossed the road in a not marked place.
(sound StVO is this however no mitigating circumstance - which has steering wheels, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra crossing, Nachrang.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after his admission in the hospital.
According to police reports the steering wheel suffered a shock, put thereafter its functions back and asked for retirement.
The Budapester public prosecutor's office introduced its determinations to the incident.
Besides Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police head had cooperated from the outset with the Ermittlern.
Further 400 millions EUR for infrastructure
Ministers of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the European Investment bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements in the total value of 400 millions EUR on Friday in Budapest. The money is to flow into education, traffic and environmental protection infrastructure and energy industry.
The European Investment bank (EIB) granted 300 millions in the year 2006 a EUR framework for the financing of traffic and environmental protection projects, which are realized with subsidies by the coherence fund. The credit agreement over 100 millions was signed already in former times, in the current agreement goes it around the use of the verliebenen 200 millions EUR.
The sum of 150 millions EUR, agreed upon in the loan agreement, is to be likewise spent on the budgetaere financing by education projects.
The EIB granted altogether 300 millions EUR for this purpose for Hungary; on the use of the remaining 150 millions EUR in the context of the expansion of the credit agreement one decides later.
Within the range the contracting parties an agreement over 50 millions EUR signed innovation, which will predominantly flow into research and development programs at the University of Debrecen.
When meeting also the underground line 4 came to the language.
It was agreed upon that as soon as Hungary clarified the details of the underground financing with the European Union, which original contract and possible modifications are again discussed.
According to János Veres would be possible this in the first quarter 2008.
Since 1990 financed the EIB altogether 113 projects in the total value of 8,4 billion EUR in Hungary.
The credit interests are EURIBOR bound, the loan of the EIB with a delay of 8 years, commission-free are made available.
Bulgaria, the real estate immobilien-Paradies of the European Union
The development of the Bulgarian property market is marvelous - completely Europe looks attentively on the in former times rarely mentioned Balkans state.
What, where, and who buys at the still cheapest market of the European Union, which becomes rapidly more expensive however?
An analysis of the Bulgarian RH/MAX of division.
Bulgaria is at present without a doubt most in demand plaster for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with favorable ski apartments and houses at the sea.
Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa count the "gold coast" to the most popular, at the sea are Albena, the "sun coast", and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however real estates are approximately in demand for Kavarna and Balcik also ever more.
According to estimates of RH/MAX analysts in Bulgaria wid also the interior sooner or later investors attract, thus for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also expressed the favorable area of Russian registers more buyer.
The capital Sofia offers likewise enticing offers - handels and office surfaces offer highest net yields.
Bulgaria is to be become on the best way one the most attractive European Golferparadiese to thus attract and apart from the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons tourists.
Foresighted investors buy therefore already now on a large scale, for example approximately around Bansko.
According to analysts humans, who acquire real estates, strive also a change of their life change in Bulgaria on.
In addition, most buyers are Englishman, it come prospective customers from France, Belgium, Spain, and ever more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are likewise present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers with the black sea and in the skiing areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, say Georgij Jankov, director of regional von Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those, which want to establish themselves, buy either revitalisierte real estates around 50-100.000 euro, or heruntergekommene houses around 5-15.000 euro, which recondition them then.
Good binding and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are largely written, in addition, the proximity to a large city, business and physicians are crucial for the buyers.
To the second category belong those, which are on the search to a holidays domicile (Bulgaria was listed in December under the Top Ten vacation goals of the Germans).
Businessmen constitute the third group, who invest with the goal of a central to long-term increase in value.
Real estates in the capital meanwhile constantly more expensively, due to the always growing demand.
Within the European Union the real estate prices are in Bulgaria at the lowest, in the past five years gave it however a price increase around annually 21 per cent.
The price increase with the real estate prices exceeds by far the rise of the salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent
How secretary of the environment communicated Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings go on Tuesday to end, and the debate over the international air conditioning after 2012 is continued by the Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise over the timetable of Bali, in which the emission-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012, thus at expiration of Kyoto minutes.
At present a violent debate between industrie and developing countries is under way.
The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however would be ready it to reduce to 2020 the greenhouse gas missions compared with 1990 by 25-40 per cent.
The other large question of the conference is to be supported, whether the industrial nations are ready, apart from the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financially, and technologically.
Also an agreement was obtained over the support by developing countries.
That Kyoto minutes subordinated adjustment funds is to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, presumably at the global Umweltfazilitaet (GEF) the UN, as in the "Piac és profit" is to be reread.
Of Hungary six per cent
Secretary of the environment Gábor Fodor supports the effort of the European Union in the name of Hungary to maintain their role of the pioneer with global climatic preventive measures to obtain and until 2009 a new international agreement.
The Minister explained, who European Union to 2020 by 20% will reduce the greenhouse gas missions (based on the values of 1990), independently of it whether the "agreement is successfully obtained after 2012", or not. The union would be even ready to use itself for a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other large industrial nations of the world, and/or developing countries are likewise ready to follow their obligations after forces and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states, which had joined 1997 Kyoto minutes was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, whereas the European Union with their had already committed itself at that time 15 member states to a minus of 8%.
The default for Hungary reads reduction of the greenhouse gas missions around 6% compared with the years 1985-87 - a default, which will quite fulfill the country, as is to be reread in the press release of the Department of the Environment.
The employment is high on Bali - nevertheless the long-term international climaticpolitical agreement must be finished within two years, otherwise it would only enter into force with security after 2012. In this case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects specified in Kyoto minutes, whose meaning also the IPCC, which emphasized international scientific climatic change committee of the UN in its recent report, distinguished with the Nobel peace prize.
Thus the emission reduction would retard, and the increase of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to Wissenschaftern.
British army recruits on YouTube
Units of the British army published photographs over operations in the Iraq and in Afghanistan for popularity increase on the video portal.
First the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Into Afghanistan stationed special-purpose forces load led operations since March 2006 videos over against the Taliban in the net, report the BBC.
Also on helmets miniature cameras fastened turned photographs afterwards at the Air Force base in Kandahar are controlled and to London sent, where they are placed in the InterNet.
Political message unavoidably
Soldiers of the Air Force contributed 139 such photographs, were already regarded it "channel" more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring 2007, in order to publish videos over Iraqi and Afghan operations, in addition, the British State Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI), stationed in the Iraq, have own YouTube channels.
Employment in Afghanistan
Originally the Air Force has the videos with the goal of recruiting soldiers published, and how the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions serve also the purpose to inform the population about the actual goals of the international missions.
Such kind published propaganda is almost free of charge compared with conventional television commercials, like that defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however these videos always carry a certain measure of political message in itself, since they confirm the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government in own way.
Americans recruit with play
The army must fight in addition, against amateur photographs, which it beside the carefully worked on, to zensurierten photographs likewise in the net creates - as for instance such, which show the death of the soldiers: Spoken in the something heuchlerischen, "official" propaganda films about the losses at the most, the bloody sides of the war will not become however shown.
From the theaters in the Iraq and in Afghanistan already numerous videos turned in the employment were by the way loaded on the platform, this "kind" to have the British however only recently for itself were discovered.
The Americans recruit meanwhile in the something other kind, i.e. with the free of charge downloadable shooting play "America's Army", in which the player can slip in the context of a more or less life-faithful simulation into the skin of the soldier.
Weihnachtsfeier with tombola and Pogat in the Ministries
Work minister Mónika Lamperth is not by any means zimperlich: Instead of a Weihnachtsfeier she organizes a conference of work, at which her coworkers can let the year 2007 with coffee and Pogat end.
Some Ministries celebrate other charms Weihnachtsstimmung with tombola or knocking against with live-musik, into the official hearts.
Party, Weihnachtsstimmung, concerts and Buffet - in such a way power celebrates.
The Weihnachtsfieber seized already also the offices.
The largest Weihnachtsfeier of a Ministry is held this year in the defense department, however in addition the coworkers of the Ministry are not expected.
Presented with the "Weihnachtsfeier of the orphans" children of pleased soldiers, with which "mission celebration" family members become regaled from at present soldiers stationed abroad, in addition, it gives a receipt for the press.
The department makes approximately 25 millions available for the ceremonies.
Compared with other departments the national agency for development (NFUe) and the Ministry for economics and traffic strike over the strands.
Expensive Weihnachtsfeier of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the house of the future held, it will become about 350 of the 600 coworkers expected the 4,32 millions Forint.
The emphasis of the ceremonies is on Christmas, it in addition, to live-acts and a tombola drawing will give.
The national agency for development (NFUe) held its 4.7 millions Forint expensive Weihnachtsfeier on Wednesday in the house of the national senior counsel (OIT), with concerts and a festessen.
The hall rent amounted to 1 million Forint, the remainder on the more than 400 loaded guests was spent.
After our information a department of the NFUe is invited also with another Weihnachtsfeier, which is organized by the Hungarian economic development center (Zrt LIKES) from European Union funds.
For the celebration the building of the lustspieltheaters ("Vígszínház") was rented.
Those LIKES Zrt these information did not confirm, since we did not reach the responsible persons.
For what the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFUe, but also the Ministry for law and police nature, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Weihnachtsfeier on 7 December.
They did not have to pay a rent for the use of the premises to the OIT.
Approximately 500 visitors came to the ball.
The ceremonies with a speech of the Minister were opened, after whom Dinner gave it to live-musik to dances.
On request of [ origo ] one divided with: It did not prevail at the ball ball dress or a suit obligation.
The Ministries for health, work, and autonomy prepare in each case for puritanische celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the coworkers in the own four walls for approximately 400,000 Forint.
Work minister Mónika Lamperth does not load her coworkers officially to a Weihnachtsfeier, but yearlyended to the conference to.
One expects approximately 180 guests, who - so the press department - are regaled only with coffee and Pogat, then goes out itself the celebration with 350.000 Forint.
Autonomy Minister Gordon Bajnai will knock against with his colleagues simply only in the aula of the Ministry.
The Treasury (PM) organizes a Weihnachtsfeier in the own festival room, to which 436 coworkers are expected.
The expenditures were measured with 2.500 Forint per head - around this money there is a Buffet receipt with following knocking against.
Since beginning of the term of office of János Veres the coworkers of the PM celebrate each year in this way.
However no correct party tendency will arise - not only because of the official speech of the Minister but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry Of Agriculture loads to 20. Jaenner to a New Year receipt, the Weihnachtsfeier of the Ministry precipitates this time.
One asks the one hundred guests in the lock Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information of the department the expenditures with 1.000 Forint per guest are limited.
As the press department announces, it becomes a very simple standing receipt, to which only into Hungary accredited foreign diplomats are loaded.
The receipts, which are organized each year, begin traditionally with a short speech of the Minister and end with reserved Schmausen.
How the enstprechenden pressestellen announce on [ origo ] request, it will give neither with the outside nor with the education Ministry a Weihnachtsfeier.
Asked for the costs of the Weihnachtsfeier one could not give information at the press department of the Department of the Environment.
Anyhow more than 400 guests were loaded to the celebration, which is organized in the museum of arts and crafts.
Ever mobilizes more forces for giant strike
The league trade unions and the Hungarian trade union federation form on Friday their coordinating committee for on Monday the strike beginning indefinite duration.
On Saturday a protest large meeting is held, on Monday - on the day of the popular vote to the health insurance law - begins the strike.
It is counted substantial verkehrsbehinderungen on strike-conditioned, since the eisenbahnverkehr is almost completely stopped, and also the Budapester of public transporting enterprises (BKV) strikes to 13 o'clock.
Detail given to the strike on Monday on Friday afternoon of the league trade unions and the trade union federation together admits.
It is created also LEAGUE - MOSZ strike committee, which is responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest large meeting is held, and starting from Monday all organizations, which followed the strike, lay down the work for indefinite time, if with the government no agreement is obtained.
In other words the end on the day of the parlamentary vote of the strike beginning over the health insurance law was not defined.
If the national council should not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions take the call back to the strike immediately.
If the law is however passed, the strike committees meet, in order to advise over the further procedure.
Due to the agenda of the national council on Monday it is even conceivable that it comes only in the later evening hours, or only around midnight to the tuning over the health insurance law.
By on Monday the strikes beginning one will have to count on substantial verkehrsbehinderungen: The railroadmen lay down their work for indefinite time, in the morning stand still the majority of the public means of transport and more than half of the Volán societies.
At the same time it will give in many places motorway barriers of a direction.
Numerous trade unions and civilian organizations followed the call to the strike - which list of the participants updated on the league Website constantly.
Some organizations announced strikes on indefinite time, other flat limited strike.
Until Thursday knew afternoon between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free trade union of the railroadmen VDSZSZ still no agreement over sufficient achievements is obtained, although straight are around the Weihnachtsfeiertage ever more humans with the course on the way.
After past reports with the BKV von Betriebsstart to at 13 o'clock, with Budapest air haven between 7 and 9 o'clock early, the LEAGUE trade unions for current and heat energy lays down the work is struck for four hours, and the teacher trade union bwz. the democratic teacher trade union to have to 2 and/or. 2-8 hour strikes called.
The Hungarian association of physicians strikes country-wide alternating at different times, the EDDSZ, the democratic trade union in the health and social welfare matters of the persons employed, a subsidiary organization of the SZEF, the forum for co-operation of the trade unions, holds an two-hour token strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government takes the draft back for the reform of the health insurance and a new conception for social discourse submitted.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension computation model, which becomes due starting from the next year.
Demand number three reads that the entrance to the early retirement system is already made possible for the rightful occupational groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the league trade unions submitted from the traffic Ministry offer concerning the Nebenlinien did not accept and now a new concept demands.
Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
In opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities in this August of the Hungarian guard created with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard.
In the "risk warning report" of the institute it means among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the "aggravation of the ethnical tensions already existing between the gypsies and population of non--gypsy in Hungary, who could lead even at short notice to violent ethnical arguments".
Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably aims at the provocation of such an argument, so Forschungsinstitut.
How reports, this is regarded as omission on the part of that politically responsible persons: "persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groupings, which developed now their political strategy on the Rome outer yarn contrast".
One assumes the fact that this intensify the problem, whom makes reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments.
In addition the Forschungsinsitut means, which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, not least damaged owing to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, in particular which concerns the confidence in stability and democratic ripe ones".
We remember: Since autumn is 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several were based, "national self-defense association" organizations calling.
"these groupings it is common that they in each case define themselves as civilian organization, while they prahlen openly with the fact their members up - every now and then armed - tasks of defense to prepare (disaster control, national defense, order guarding), with reference to the unfitness of the police, the army, and/or the state" it was said.
And further: All this happens in accordance with that method, which tries, different, to camouflage on the policies and Parteiverdrossenheit of the population based, political efforts as civil initiative.
The stress of the civilian character and the association form serve thus not only the evasion of legal hurdles, which could emerge in the course of the entry with court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
How is to be inferred from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relations with the neighbour states.
"in the last months the Hungarian guard in several neighbour states was quoted as potenzielle source of danger, so some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary politics.
All this has effects on the political stability of the region "- it meant.
From the view of the research institute the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not a single phenomenon in central Eastern Europe, thus the political risk for the entire region grew.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable to the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment was communicated in August 2007 by the right-wing extremist Bulgarian national union (BNU) with those.
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were located the Rome to eating excesses, which took place in a borough of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the goal of the organization is the "national protection".
According to their opinion a proper "gypsy terror" was in Bulgaria noticeable, the state remained however doless and indifferently - in such a way Political Capital in the past 17 years.
And further: The initiative would have kicked loose a violent debate in the Bulgarian public.
How said, also proven the increased risk for ethnical arguments by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to create for resistance purposes their own guard.
Since activities Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those Bulgarian national guard shows, not to exclude is it that the Hungarian Roma likewise, with which to the threats reacts, is called to organizing its own protection it in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research with Political Capital said on request of the press agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis report published, and should is informed annually risk-changing tendencies be recognizable, the public opinion, as in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exact, so that the practice of making new arrangements the working days was meanwhile established approximately around the holidays, however give to us the coming year less such days.
Also in the European Union and in America one understands something else by "holiday".
The Hungarian juridical system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or stand with important historical events in connection.
We celebrate New Year for example also: Both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new yearly are work-free days - thereby the latter alone the Silvester celebrating to rest itself can do.
In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are 15 March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and which 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work, is celebrated on 1 and 2 November thinks of we our dead ones.
Beyond that there are ever two holidays to Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas.
Since our state -, national or religious holidays on one weekend fall rarely, the practice of the "working day shift" worked satisfactorily in the cases, in which we would work before or after the holiday only one day.
The price of the extended weekends is however the fact that we very probably work on Saturdays before it or into the school to go must.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be processed finally is specified, since long years by the employment minister in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and takers, to public employees and officials of the public service equally.
Excluded are only companies and mechanisms, in which the enterprise without interruption, thus also at the holidays, is continued.
This year working rules is only brought somewhat in disorder by the holidays at the year end: Starting from 24 December the life in this country stops formally, since most for the days between Christmas and Silvester time reconciliation, or which particularly for it waived vacation take.
In the next year fall more holidays into the week center, and/or on the end of the week, so that it will give fewer changes of plans at the working days, than this year.
The calendar is placed first approximately around the day of the work "on the head", so that humans can remain equal four days at the piece at home.
Saturday, which will be 26 April one working day, thereby Friday, 2 May one quiescent day can.
The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, which 18 October one will process Friday, 24 October first must.
The end of the yearly will be located however completely in the indication of the holidays, after starting from 24 December everything remains lying and standing, even if Silvester on one Wednesday falls.
Six deterring little things, in order to annoy teammates
Enamel, which we forget to send, to language messages, which we never receive - harmless lies, which are not noticeable to us any longer: They bring "color" into the everyday life on the job.
The question is bare, whether one gets accustomed to these small incommodities, or places themselves one better to the challenge and tries these misleading to vermweiden for other annoying situations consciously.
Tipps.
"Sorry, I has forgets you to align that someone from the marketing department called" - a colleague says.
That one missed thereby a meeting?
One regrets it at best and tries it again to good-close perhaps, by calling at the marketing department and confessing reumuetig, one would have forgotten to align the message (that is the less usual method).
The thing with an apology is dismissed mostly.
Before one involves oneself into embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one can to prepare and try its colleague indeed unpleasant moments to avoid these situations consciously.
Something lent, which does not belong to one?
There are hardly something Nervigeres, as if one after a document, office supply, or the telephone seizes, not there but it is.
Yesterday did the booklet equipment still lie on the desk - this morning is it away?
Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague discovered?
Without to ask one should not itself anything of the colleagues check-out counters, because they are by right annoyed, if they state that somewhat got away.
Thus, no covers or post office its from the office into the bag put, because it could meet one: keins more there, if man's nevertheless urgently needs.
GET ratchet over the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a gossip, which was already set into the world.
Who with whom, which made?
Where and why?
One should not bind the information (or assumptions) over the private life of the colleagues after possibility for everyone to the nose!
And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless, we should not abuse this confidence!
Best one is silent like a grave, instead of aligning straight the not present one, even if others know about the problems of the colleague also.
Without reason ill announced?
If one calls in the office, in order to announce itself with reference to tormenting headache ill, because one feels straight uneasy, or to simply only rest itself, should one would like to realize oneself over one: Now the colleagues must settle the own work, urgent completions, projects with firm dates instead of one.
The colleague thus badly do not along-play!
If one already knows at the vortag that one will not create it on the next day in the office, or that somewhat interfere could, why one must remain at home, should one it in time announce, so that neither the colleagues, still the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Gesumme, Gekicher, telephoning
One is deepened straight in its work, by the loud Gekicher of the colleagues is however suddenly disturbed?
Inadvertently a telephone call belongs, which one should not have heard better?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud discussions (which one leads across its heads away), Getrampel, continuing grumbling or Noergeln nerves.
All this can be disturbing much, even if they are not deepened straight in a task (write, plan, organize).
Is the other debt always?
If a project is finished not within the prescribed period, one has an important letter or important realigns forgotten to send, should not look for one the debt of the own forgetfulness not with others!
After possibility one should not dissuade oneself from on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one confesses oneself its to error, and apologizes, if others were affected also by it!
The question, how one good-makes the error again, or which missed retrieve can, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training trousers and Schlapfen: Comfortably for at home, however in the office nothing lost!
Not even then one should dress so casual, if it would actually permit the job!
Only not too schlampig will - one should respect oneself both its colleagues, and so far that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also prettily and elegantly!
All by right to make want - or as one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and go-traffic, the car in the middle in the all-morning back-up.
From the radio a strange melody rings out: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume more highly.
The speed changes, to the past sounds comes the bass, and as genuine sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings OF Love" from Zagar, which rings out on mr2.
The domestic music scene does not have us long time straight delicately with qualitative Electropop.
But one sees even the back-up now differently, if one hears thereby the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital Underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall view, and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequit again "in" is, to which domestic Electropop proves: There is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, made music even in the volumes Yonderboi, before he - perhaps, because a pub does not stand two Pfeifer - its own way to walk on began.
It created the break-through with its project (Zagar) and its music, which merge elements from jazz, electronics, and Pop, however only as one with the request to compose the sound TRACK to a film to him had come closer (e.g.
"Szezon" of Ferenc Toeroek).
The formation, which had arisen at first in smaller clubs, became known to the broader public only, than the magazine "wan2" lined its first album up from the year 2002 under the Top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, kuerte to the almost only, also trendsetter marketable in the west.
Without a doubt Zagar were and its volume "trendy", it interested however none whether they carried this mark also gladly.
The volume reacted, as it should: With a new, still better album.
The new album with the title "CAN emergency, appeared now, mill Fly Instead" could to them new ways open, however the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes of to the time, when Balázs Zságer was still with another volume on the way.
The airy, flying allusion would be also correct, however the influences of the Rock'n'Roll are noticeable apart from the ethereal character of the music - the spirit of the time and the trend appropriate - the louder guitar.
With these songs in England living and with that volume "The puzzle" thought of working singers Gyoergy Ligeti with the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song of the album it even to the radio hit created - which has sending mr2 Pet?fi since newest one from early to late Popmusik the listeners with the number "Wings OF Love", which was taken up under co-operation by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), gradually the ear worm set.
Everything in order thus (?).
Hvg.hu with Balázs Zságer inquired.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain layer remain reserving?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" does not mean me straight much.
According to my opinion there is two box in the Popmusik, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and Pop, but commercial and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallowly and insignificant, exactly the same can it in addition, only for the sales be produced, which makes it commercial music.
Also a good Pop number can develop from an honest motive.
The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle, from languages and national borders independently.
hvg.hu: Do you face with a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign public your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, in particular west of us the Popmusik has a larger tradition.
There goes not only dte rodent or Twens on concerts, but also the older public.
They pursue the trends in the Popmusik, which happen around them, many more attentively, because they regard them also as a part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which role comes the public too with your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many hears your music?
B. Zs.: It is natural a good feeling to see that ever more come to our concerts.
We however never composed for the market.
With us the music does not develop, in order to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly noticeable with the concerts, where there is already a mutual reciprocal effect, but it gives again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment.
One were noticeable to me nevertheless: If you want to make it quite for all, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
It is as soloist on the way and its career rather in the west developed.
B. Zs.: We do not go really its way, times of the fact completely apart that one tries again and again to in-interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as Teamplayer, which can trust on the musical operational readiness level of the other one and be unfolded them.
At first were naturally comparisons of our work with from Yonderboi inevitable, since several from us its volumes come and hit another way.
hvg.hu: In the Charts of mr2 Pet?fi stands for "Wings OF Love" in the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar only in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style consciously produced toward a broader public?
B. Zs.: We did not have plans to write a hit which was to then hold as a course horse for the album.
In this song it concerns more.
It was meant as final of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the Klangorgie and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why straight it, which was the guidance principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved choir.
Then the idea came to arrange the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
Thus did the sechskoepfige choir develop - thus for Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik? Hodosi [ Neo ], Juci Németh -, which we baptized then more apaeter "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song exactly the same, or it the girls codesigned?
B. Zs.: The number gave it already longer in the instrument valley version, but than the material for the album was finished, we imagined that this number needs still "something".
The chord succession required formally for a singing voice.
I in-sang the melody still at the same night, learned later her the girls.
It came everything practically at first attempt and frightening spontaneously.
I can remember, I was at that time rather electrified, but already also the "Divas" required.
With my voice alone the song would have become never so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate, and with the concert one had however the impression, the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo one from Judy Jay), it has no own role, sings perfectly together and is not not louder, than the music, therefore its singing of the music only not accompanied.
Also on the stage they stood in the back.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: The fact that they are confessed in the back was because of purely technical problems like that.
However we wanted them consciously to give no solo roles.
In the number it goes also forgetting therefore that one is to forget its Ego a little, who from where come and where on the way is, we permit simply that us these certain wings, which raise wings of the love.
I would like that also different feel this euphoric condition, which we felt, when the song developed.
hvg.hu: Which was the most complex song?
B. Zs.: With the musical work work actually none, it gave more difficult tasks rather when mixing.
For example with "Dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or with "Rock'n'Roll Goes ton of The Girls", where the Groove did not want to function longer, but gradually joined itself everything, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favourite number of the new album?
B. Zs.: Changes with the concerts constantly and still, where I the album "losgelasssen" has.
At present there is "prophet Is A Fool", "escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Soil-loose cheat
Thus Jerome Kerviel the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer?ní designates its former employee banka.
She came because of him around nearly five billion euro.
It seems however rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player, who wanted to do it equal its colleagues beyond that surely not was unable.
To the difference to all large banking houses it recognized in time the crisis by amerikanischenn the mortgage market.
"it is psychologically rather weak," was from the mouth of its superiors to be heard, who indicated it at the police.
Like however from the statements Kerviels, which published the French media, for example the daily paper Le of moons, was it comes out humans, the end of last yearly with its business of profits at a value of 1.6 billion euro had obtained.
Crisis not only in America
"everything that I wanted, was to be earned for my bank money," states it in its statement.
In the summer he had succeeded in earning straight at the American crisis a half billion euro.
The opportunity in addition it had already erspaeht at the yearly beginning.
In February gave it already first messages over that so-called Sub Prime sub-Prime-Hypotheken, how they are given income-weak customers or such, who had already in former times payment by instalments problems, in difficulties were guessed.
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however.
Kerviel believed that not and kept right.
At the year end it had raised its profit up to 1.6 billion euro.
"as I had already earned the first half billion, did not know I not, as I that to be explained should," admit Kerviel and continue to say that he had kept definitely nothing for itself.
During the whole verhoers it admits that it falsified documents, so that one would not come it on the schliche.
It succeeded to it even to lead its bosses behind the light even if gradually the Eurex stock exchange were interested in its business.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Probably hardly.
"I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
From where did it take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gain its position gradually.
The Société Générale it occurred in the year 2000, after it had directly terminated its study at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollar.
After two years he was an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 already became he an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollar.
He knew nevertheless that he will earn never as much as others.
"with my first discussion in the year 2005 I already knew that one observed me.
Because of my training and also because of my vocational and personal development, "Kerviel explained the investigation official.
But already soon after its entrance first large success came.
With the shares of the alliance he earned much, by setting a half billion euro with the Londoner bomb attacks on kursverluste of this title.
And that was the trip - now he wanted more.
Solang you profit makes, leaves we you
"that is like a schneeball," said it the policemen.
But the bosses knew allegedly from everything, and/or suspected it.
"I money earned, closed one the eyes so long."
But then this yearly the large impact came at the beginning.
On only one day it lost a billion euro.
On one weekend in the middle of January wanted it to adjust.
When he came on Monday to the work, already was he no more employees of the bank.
And a few days the bank announced later that it had lost because of him five billion euro.
And how did they come it on the schliche?
It made itself suspicious by one vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A broker, who does not take vacation, is one, which does not want that one looks him into the maps, "said Kerviel finally.
Tschechien has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representative of the European commission signed yesterday altogether nine development programs, by which the Czech republic can come in the next years to 14 billion euro (about 365 billion crowns).
It concerns here approximately half of the sum, which can receive Tschechien in the years 2007 to 2013 at all from Brussels.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies about 100 billion crowns from the program "enterprise and innovation" assigned to get to be able.
At most money, approximately 150 billion, into the traffic development will flow.
The traffic program is covered the largest development program and up to 22 per cent of the means, which can receive Tschechien from the fund.
This money increases according to the household of the national traffic infrastructure fund, which will have next year 90.8 billion.
The program "enterprise and innovation" is to serve entrepreneurs and companies to win funds for innovative enterprises.
The companies are to win thereby finances for the introduction of new technologies, for operational research, in addition, for the introduction of more effective orgwares.
With the past money Aquisition from European Union funds Tschechien under the new entry countries belongs to so far to few successful.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year-old detention for Expraesidenten
An industrial tribunal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year-old detention for the former president Arnold Alemán on Thursday, to which it had been condemned 2003 because of finance fraud at a value of 100 million dollar (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However it was later from the prison dismisses and lived under house arrest on its Hazienda with the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes again behind lattices, is at present unclear according to the press agency AP.
The chairmen of the industrial tribunal, Ileana Pérez, according to it will depend now on the detention officials whether one lets Alemán its punishment serve at home, or whether it must in the prison.
A court proved before four years that Alemán had shifted regularly money of the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to its related and closest trailers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund, which Alemán had furnished for the financing of its election campaign 2001.
Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved of.
What is special at this household?
It is the first household, which this government sketched, and which without support of the opposition by the coalition majority one accepted.
For the current year still with support of the?SSD (Social Democrats) one approved of, because it Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted, and which could not take the liberty?SSD it therefore to reject him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the tuning over the motion of no confidence against the government this time nothing dramatic happened.
The Lower House approved of this traditionally little considered, nevertheless most important law in all peace.
That is to a certain extent paradoxical.
All governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether pleases or not.
The household is a substantial component of the policy, however covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition.
That is for the media a more grateful topic, and therefore they dedicate more attention to him.
A controversy among politicians is many more interesting for the public than sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments under three weak points, which the household can eliminate for the year 2008 not at one time:
First is the high portion of expenditures, which are because of obligating of law, whereby it does not only concern the pensions, but also around social expenditures, which the "tacit" coalition of?SSD and KS?M (communist) decided in the last year before the elections.
Second is the defizitaere budgetary policy as consequence of the first weak point.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budgetary deficits of the municipalities.
The largest risk is not however the national budgetary deficit.
This household is public and eingermassen under control.
A true time bomb is however the budgetary deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors spent, in order to open except incomes from taxes, deliveries and bank credits further sources on investments, often inconsiderately debenture bonds, by which they were to blame for their city halls in the oversize.
In the last years it succeeded to them, these debts by massive sales of shares of the energy and of different supply networks, which had received it in the course of the privatisation from the state to pay off.
Now is this source already triumphs.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we state that:
our economics already for some years, how the remainder of the world goes through, a growth phase, whose the?SSD without omit yourself praises.
That represented a unique possibility for its governments of bringing public finances in order.
Instead these governments were to blame for the state however still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, kept house many more reasonably than our republic.
That is a giant dishonor, which is to be attributed predominantly to the former governments.
We belong to the countries, those, in the global yardstick seen, to few by poverty are threatened.
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary, which redundant-proves unfortunately straight completely in the last years in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if succeeded, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures, which were adopted this year before the elections, to paint, is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entrance age and to a pension reform will remain, then ends practically any politics in this country, and, equal to who in power is whole, for it nothing as pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated, if one says that then from dominant politicians officials become, who divide the largest part of the tax receipts mechanically on pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore the household of this year can no revolution be, but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by expenditures for obligation stop order.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns, planned for 2008, would be quite redundant, if former governments had not spent in the last ten years, which only went.
If we do not want that it comes really to the fact that from dominant politicians pure civil servants become, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, that is aware however of its that the state can spend only so much, as it is at taxes and fees to take able peace during the preparation of further reform laws to wish.
Only these make possible a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget.

Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve, the European central bank and the central banks of Great Britain, which Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
Thus more than 100 billion dollar by means of auctions at the currency markets will arrive.
On these auctions auction the banks of interest rates, to which they are ready mutually money to borrow.
For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollar on auction, further 24 makes it loose for the European one and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the notices 11-Septembers the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on an in such a manner coordinated procedure for the defense and/or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis.
"this step is to eliminate the largest difficulties of the economy, thus the increasing lack of freely available capital, which the banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Berne pool of broadcasting corporations Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of a recession in the USA of 65% to approximately 50%, added" Baumohl in its report.
The banks already lost because of not served credits by 60 billion dollar, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect still further billion-losses.
"" the central banks must have really had fear before it, which still everything can follow, when to this procedure decided, "said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"it looks in such a way that the situation is really bad," continued to say he.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have heavily entrance to loans, for their customers of credits become also more expensive.
That would reduce the consumption and would fall the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world.
The central banks decided to after they had not succeeded, which sucked. To lower LIBOR, the Londoner interbank rate, which is used with the moneylending between banks.
That means it that the banks had constantly fear to borrow itself mutually money and although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn their interest rates had several times lowered.
"that will have the same effect as a further sinking of the interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts are the opinion that this step of the central banks contributes the case of the property market in the USA to the heating of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climatic changes harm allegedly developing countries at most.
President Václav Klaus expressed itself again for the problem of the global heating up.
The criticism referred now to the international conference of the UN going to end to the climatic change to Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "bluer, no greener planet", it implemented that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is inakzeptabel, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such from non-government organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetorik, which accompanies it, and which reality.
"the debate is unstructured there, it is word fireworks, only replacement is for a real solution of present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech president stressed with the conception of his book that its topic for him was very important, and that it for it therefore engage itself in such a way.
It expressed also its satisfaction over the fact that its book in German translation appears, because "I often meet on caricatures of my opinions."
Now prospective customers could reread its attitude thus undistorted.
Klaus reminded of the fact that it was not Klimatologe, but it has according to its opinion sufficient conditions, in order to write such a book.
It is finally of university graduates, capable of, to understand and judge technical papers, has experience with statistics and is also a political economist.
When it designated main statement of the book the thesis that the climate constantly changes and that its changes are thus normal that it does not give an agreeing opinion among the scientists to the ground electrode warming that the consequences of the present changes are not too large and serious and represented thus no threat, and that the efforts are aufwaendig to affect the development of the climate redundantly, ineffectively and inakzeptabel.
Beyond that consider it it as someone, which has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, unacceptable, to other unproven opinions to force upon, it regard as dangerous restriction of the liberty.
On questions of present one explained it repeated, it is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant Oeko Aktivisten, no consideration take on the relationship between expenditure and yield."
About the same topic Klaus in Vienna had already spoken two months ago ago in Hayek Hayek-Institut.
it did not succeed to 600000 people to exchange their driving licence
600000 drivers missed the period, in order to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity end of the yearly runs off.
Today is the last day, where one can request the conversion, so that the authorities create it, to issue up to the end of the yearly a new driving licence.
The Ministry however does not fear that after New Year drivers without valid driving authorization go hundredthousands on the roads.
According to the authorities mainly those did not exchange their driving licence, which do not want to drive no more.
While small places announce a strong dropping of the interest at the Fueherscheinumtausch, the offices of the capital with requests become ueberschuettet, and the interest in the conversion grew this week still.
The city administration dispatches daily approximately 2000 customers.
One must line up approximately a half hour.
In Prague have approx.. 140000 drivers their driving licence not yet exchanged.
The exhibition new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a shortened period from five days to.
In this case the driver must to it-pay however 500 crowns.
A fine threatens drivers, who do not create the prescribed conversion up to the year end and without valid driving licence drive off, starting from January.
The evil author pays maximally 2000 crowns.
The police can do it however during the infringement also with an admonishment bewenden to leave.
In the case of an infringement the punishment can rise to 2500 crowns.
After earlier information can get also that by the municipality a punishment imposed, to which at all does not drive.
It can, then was called it, a punishment of even 30000 crowns to threaten.
The Ministry called the offices already in addition, mildness walten to leave and at the most one punishment of 1000 crowns up-succumb.
The speaker of the traffic Ministry, Karel Hanzelka, according to threaten however nobody thousand-crown punishment.
The driving licence is a document, with which everyone can decide whether it wants to possess it or not.
It does not concern an identity card, which everyone, a valid, must have.
People, which do not want to drive no more, should deliver their driving licence.
It is sufficient to bring it to the responsible municipal office or to send it by writings there.
At the year end driving licences become invalid, which were issued between 1964 and 1993.
The drivers must however gradually also further kinds of driving licences conversions.
People with driving licences from the years 1994 to 2000 have for the conversion still three years time.
The validity of driving licences, which were issued 2001 to 2004, ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it concerns thereby approximately 2.6 million of further driving licences.
Court lowers punishments for detectives, who were allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Ko?a?ík, which are accused of with the gang of David Berdych common thing to have made received 13 and/or 10 years detention.
That decided the Prager higher regional court, which reduced thereby its punishment around and/or by two years in a valid judgement.
Originally 14 and/or 12 years threatened the detectives of the "office for the fight against the organized crime".
Against the today's judgement there is no appointment possibility, only revision with the highest court is possible.
Berdych is accused in this thing also, but is approaching for it first the erstinstanzliche judgement.
With other processes it had however already received punishments from altogether 16 years.
To more he cannot be condemned.
A district court spoke in January 19 persons particularly because of participation in armed robberies guiltily, the higher regional court negotiated today the appointment of 16 of them.
Most accused ones of denied from the outset the accusation with the reason, concern a designed case.
According to the mittelboehmischen district court in arrangement among other things with Berdych criminals information from sources of the police transferred member to the police, covered different armed robberies and helped members of the gang to extract itself from the prosecution.
The gang left for it Opava and Ko?a?ík to 30 per cent of the booty.
With the accusation it goes around criminal offences of the gang out of the years 1999 to 2001.
In particular around armed robberies, whose victims suffered often heavy injuries, in addition, around usurpation and bad possession of arms.
With house searches the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser sight and a submachine gun.
The gang enriched itself the accusation according to by its armed robberies around many million crowns.
Except beihnahe 20 men in this procedure courts and a number of others recognized Berdych because of further armed robberies validly than guilty.
Further men from Berdychs periphery must answer for themselves during another process, further cases not yet before the court arrived.
The main negotiation are so far Tomá? P?ta and Maro? ?ulej, which are in Irish detention and wait for the final decision over their distribution for prosecution in the Czech republic, escaped.
Exchanges children - calculation: 12 million
For the permutation of children in a relieving hospital the lawyer of damaged parents, wants Igor Veleba, from the hospital in T?ebí? 12 million crowns remuneration plus legal charges require.
For everyone of the mothers ever three million, for the fathers ever two million and for the children ever one million.
The hospital offers maximally 200000 for each pair of parents.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond?ej Dostál, agrees not at all therefore with the suggestion Velebas.
"such a suggestion we reject, it lie around a multiple too highly," said Dostál after the today's negotiation.
"around us however an opinion to this counter proposal to form to be able, we need the appraisal, which let the opposite side provide.
We will determine whether it has at all logical value.
We insist however on the opinion that for all together in the hundredthousand inheritance realm should lie, "stressed Dostál.
The amount should move it according to between 100000 and 200000 crowns for everyone of four parents.
At the beginning the family from Jablo?ov wanted one million crowns for each month, which it had not drawn up their biological daughter.
For Veleba an appraisal as basis for remuneration negotiations, which had compiled the university hospital in Prague Motol for it, served.
Parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth in opinion of specialists from the range psychology and psychiatry.
The men stood the stress situation better, even if they saw themselves in relation to reproaches, it the mistake of the newborn children have prevented could.
The women again get along with the aftereffects of experienced trauma more badly, as well as with what runs off now straight, Veleba summarized contents.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged yearly nurses of the relieving hospital in T?ebí, passed, on 9 December?.
Last week returned the children to their biological parents - Nikola to?ermáks to P?ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor the Bro? and Jaroslava Trojanová after Jablo?ov.
The district captain of the Vyso?ina (Boehmisch Boehmisch-Maehri height) transferred at the end of October to each family 100000 crowns as replacement for expenditures, them due to the error of the hospital in T?ebí?, that the district is subordinate, had developed.
All hospitals in Tschechien are of law because of liability-insured.
Into the case of doubt they must reach to a reserve fund, only exeptionally can them with the carrier assistance request.
The courts awarded so far comparatively low compensation sums to concerning, were determined the amounts by tables and moved within the range of hundredthousands, exeptionally from millions.
Polívka came around its Kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the controversy over the mark "Kingdom of Walachei".
The Richterin at the district court in Ostrava according to it used the designation "Walachi king" as the first, but the project had a team in work of many years around Tomá? Harabi? in cooperating with the actor developed.
Polívka did not participate today in the negotiation.
According to its lawyer the thing thereby is probably not terminated however and its mandator appointment will probably insert.
"the controversy goes around the fact that Mr. Harabi? and its team at the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitic sharings want, "said after the negotiation Polívkas lawyer.
All imagined with the words "Walachi kingdom" straight this actor and Komiker.
The same opinion is also Harabi?.
"we have a nearly ten-year work behind us.
, "he said raising of funds and concepts of the activities.
According to it the cause is controversy over money.
"after years it noticed to them that the project is successful and that they could have also somewhat of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work, "continued to say it.
Lucrative business
According to the court used Polívka the designation "Walachi king" for the first time in one of its television broadcasts.
1993 crowned it the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
That was not connected however at that time with the intention of justifying a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later Harabi came? on the thought to spend walachische passports.
Out of an originally spassigen action a business and a business activity crystallized, to the Harabi? then the establishment of the company "Walachi kingdom" attached.
1997 agreed Polívka of the use of its name and its signature in the passports and offered to its owners even reductions with the attendance of its farm and its stage performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The Richterin today also stated that Harabi? only the bare idea used, which had made Polívka in the transmission "manege" public for its business intentions.
"the popularity Polívkas helped the project of the walachischen kingdom reliably," said the Richterin.
It added however that the soul of the project Harabi? and its team are, which would have dedicated themselves to him intensively.
Co-operation that today zerstrittenen parties lasted up to the year 2000, as Harabi? for Polívka in Vsetín the official coronation/culmination organized.
Since then however began themselves between Polívka and Harabi? to accumulate up the disputes, which culminated in the joggle "king Boleslavs I. selected up to the sinking never flax day".
The guide roller took then on suggestion Harabi?s up Jarmila?uláková as a queen nut/mother.
2002 handed then Polívka against Harabi? and its company the complaint, which rejected the court today.
Clarity in the controversy could of Harabi? prepared match around the throne and a half princess brings.
From this a new king should come out.
He did not want to betray details and a date yet.
"we want to over-hurry nothing.
It should be like that something like the king removal in the Walachei.
The king should be selected for a certain time.
Also Mr. Polívka can announce himself at it calmly, "added Harabi? in addition.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1,6 VTi: Voruteile shrink
In order to say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear shift, the steering element and also the processing could one as rather designate below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, is now on the market, and that is better around much.
The combination with the designation SW is still another piece further, and for me remains only to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classical Hatchback 207, I had to deplore myself for example over the too small head liberty on the rear seats.
There are not these complaints now any longer, because the body combination is in such a way arranged that two-meter men will not even suffer.
Fast further
I go through the interior equipment only briefly, in order not to repeat me too much.
Concerns a Design quite succeeded, where I have objections only because of the miserable frame tunnel.
There I would welcome somewhat more designerische organization, where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times, where we possibly weighted about to short seats or head restraints.
Also the side stop improved opposite that 206 substantially.
Which concerns the space offer, one can feel the increased dimensions of the body also here.
In the combination also the lack of head liberty, already mentioned, is eliminated.
Suit-case into the trunk
The main thing at this car is however the loading space.
I (also because of the opening by hinges rueckfensters) must call that very good loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They disturb not, can be pulled apart and held also heavier articles firmly.
But we converse about the load volume.
It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which in the comparison to the competition a rather average value is.
However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class?koda the Fabia combi usually-sold in Tschechien.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we state that the Peugeot stays around clearly noticeable 52 litres.
For one foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.
But around the Positiva to emphasize, I must mention still the loading space completely flat after turning the rear seats down or also the very low ladekante.
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 KW.
And honestly said, then a 1600-Kubik-Motor should look, which propels a family Hatchback.
It is quiet, has a small consumption and moves away well.
If I compare it with its counterpart with?koda, which sometimes works, as if its exhaust with a rag would be clogged, then I can be only inspired by it.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not popular straight.
We must remember however that we tested a well equipped car with a roomy Innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine at a value of 329900 crowns still concerns.
With our engine it costs starting from 410900 crowns, which already quite much is.
The equipment Premium of the test car strikes again with 80000 crowns additionally to beech.
We had however Kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning system, automatic windshield wiper release, electrical window lifters in the back and and...
Thus the car costs altogether smooths 531900 crowns.
That is a quantity, but sums up you once the zusatzausstattung of a Fabia and you with a completely similar sum will arrive.
Thus remains only the decision, which mark one wants to select.
Integration of slowakischer pupils at britschen schools does not succeed
In British schools the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe increases, which causes native fears with around the further development of the local public education.
The integration of the east Europeans encounters so far a row obstacles.
British schools determine even cases, where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in act of violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at britschen schools illustrates appropriate the case of North Kent, where the arguments between the native and slowakischen immigrants increase gradually.
Quarrels, chicaneries and brawls among pupils were passed to the relations between parents.
The situation developed already so far that the police in Chatham arrested a slowakische woman, who had struck a ten-year boy with a steel-pipe.
The accused one of defended itself with the fact that the boy insulted it by racistic insults.
The police had to intervene also after an attack of two girls under age on a slowakischen immigrant.
The girls had made allegedly racistic remarks opposite the man and had thrown him with stones.
"as we home went, climbed a boy on a bus little house and spat on us.
When I said to him, he was to stop, threw he us with apples and pears and exposed then its gesaess, "described a nut/mother of slowakischer pupils of the newspaper The Times a further unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One the native designated the controversy with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as survival fight.
The aforementioned cases testify that the tendency between native ones and immigrants at British schools becomes ever more strained.
In Great Britain 70000 Slowaken are announced, which came on search for employment here.
About 30000 slowakische pupils therefore visit British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Karibik
For visitors it is real an island of the liberty.
Which always you expect from your vacation, which will fulfill itself, if you select only the correct.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which are calm like a pond.
Palms and universe Inclusive with waiters, who offer Pizza, ice and betoerende cocktails at the beach.
Kitesurfing, gulf and roulette.
On the islands of the Karibik you find in redundant measure.
Only on an island you find however still much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the large Antilleses.
At present the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for conquest America.
Kolumbus called it the most beautiful place, which one human eye each saw.
Havanna became once a camp or a transit camp of treasures, which had robbed the Spaniards in America and then to Europe transported.
And then the American epoch came.
The hotel Nacional originated in completely at the end 20. Century.
To build it left to one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that applied in the USA as crime (particularly during the prohibition), became on Cuba gladly seen and supports - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its guests were among other things.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, franc Sinatra.
In Havanna multistoried buildings grew, over the broad boulevards drove cars, which ranked among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets.
Ernest Hemingway bought a messuage in San Francisco de Paula, in whom proximity of Havannas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht to lie.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio star of the show Business and politician out completely their signatures left America.
And today?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna also you can leave your autograph.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails completely for you according to desire.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havanna until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiat in salty and damp air fell apart already long.
Havanna, in particular its oldest part, may not have strongly heruntergekommen, anywhere finds one in the periphery as many marvelous colonial objects of interest here as straight.
Other places are out-deseamed straight, for example Trinidad.
In view to it that the tourism brings urgently needed money, it gave it for this development green light.
In the last fifteen years not only in Havanna new hotels developed, but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on Inselchen such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other one.
Cuba offers still another Marotte, which is singular in the world and tightens above all railway lover.
Steam and the same-trieven narrow-gauge railways brought the zuckerrohr of remote plantagen to the sugar factories.
Their vehicle park was not renewed over decades, and so one sees there putzige and fully functioning locomotives, whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum.
Trip goals
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not omit the bedeutendendsten places.
So one does not have to write over Varadero or Havanna any longer in detail.
It remains mentioning only that in already the mentioned is messuage Hemingways a museum, whose attendance should not to be able to be escaped that, which likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most pictorial angles of Cuba.
The sumptuous vegetation grows on lime soil.
The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply from the valley soil, in its cavities accumulated fruitful soil, by which rock ranges also weathered are covered by close vegetation.
This valley is it, where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In its end form you can meet it, if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna.
Possibly it appears some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV serial "major Zeman" was turned there.
Trinidad
An age-old city, which was created briefly, after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought you the trade with slaves and sugars.
The wealth embodied itself in decorations the beauty of the small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly affected by the later French settlers, hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, between which sea and the Escambray mountains convenient, is a so remote place that there was no road, which would have connected the area with the remaining country there still in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unconsidered.
Nothing was built, but therefore also nothing torn off, for everyone was glad there that he had a roof over the head.
If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worthwhile itself to regard interesting places in the environment as for instance the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories".
In the evening one should go then into the Casa de la Música, which animates itself after the darkness, and where the music is not silent up to the morning.
Baracoa
Some call this small town in the east of Cuba completely the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this opinion is affected also by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape, which is hardly affected by human interferences.
The UNESCO took up this eastern Vorposten Cuba owing to there unaffected nature to its world inheritance listing.
There best chocolate manufactured, in church shows one cross of Kolumbus (in reality it developed about hundred years after the travels of Kolumbus), and of hills, where the former castle, which stands current hotel El Castillo, are several board mountains to see, from those El Yunque the most well-known are.
Over coffee, which rum, which cigars, which Sierra Maestra mountains, which pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos, over whom Tropicana tropicana-Kabarett, which Heiligtum of of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, over whom Santeria, an African religion, to which the descendants of slaves profess themselves, over all that one could many sides write.
But, as one says in such a way: Better with own eyes regard.
Allied in Afghanistan is passive, states American.
Too affects little soldier and the lack of necessary equipment according to the United States the process of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should sketch a concrete plan after the words of Secretary of Defense Robert gate for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not get lost after its conceptions, over it was in Scottish Edinburgh the representatives of the countries united, which stationed units in the south of the country.
Apart from the increasing resistance on the part of the Taliban the eight participating states discuss even further coordination plans under the allied ones.
While the United States called the NATO units by her paste Minister Robert gate to more activity, Great Britain sees the priority in the stabilization of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of development assistance.
"in Afghanistan a forward development is noticeable, but military power can be only one part of the solution.
A further part consists of making possible for the inhabitants beginning even a development of the economy and security "says the British paste Minister of the Browne of the BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity Afghan Aufstaendi achieved the highest conditions according to data of the American army for five years.
The number of act of violence ions rose in the comparison to the previous year by 27 per cent, in the southern province helmet and even by sixty per cent.
The NATO countries stationed about 40000 soldiers, about of it a quarter in the southern territory in Afghanistan.
According to the United States the allied ones are however pushed to an absolute border, which and equipment of the units concern organization.
They concretely demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan units.
"we will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and about the way, like we them to reach being able," said gates.
Similarly today the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop expressed itself.
"I am not pleased over it which we have available in Afghanistan to country and in air.
We have about ninety per cent of the soldiers and equipment, who we braeuchten, and which is too few, "said De Hoop of the agency Reuters to the conclusion of three-day-long discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Under the countries involved also controversy over prevails in the last months whether all allied ones give their best in Afghanistan.
Because of passivitaet for example Germany was criticized.
"the Germans are relatively numerously represented in Afghanistan.
They are however in areas stationed, where there is only one minimum of force and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called this week the German soldiers sluggards.
"Afghan nothing door unmasks: The Germans make plays, while ours fight young, "wrote" the Sun "in a contribution, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers, the table tennis play.
The German picture newspaper turned into to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit with a Rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt becomes in the year 2009 high-fast on one trillion
To each Czech a national debt of 84000 crowns is allotted.
The joint and several debt rose to at the end of of Septembers to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to be to blame for itself this year with 159.2 billion Konen.
At the beginning of of Decembers reduced the Ministry owing to the better development of the national striking stop politics the plan however to 152.8 billion.
The national debt of the Czech republic rose to at the end of of Septembers to 842.7 billion crowns.
Within the first nine months of this yearly they rose therefore by 40.2 billion.
Since June they sank however by 13.4 billion.
The Treasury confirmed thereby its data concerning the national debt of at the beginning of October.
To each Czech a debt of 84000 crowns is allotted.
Over the entire past year the state was to blame for itself around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
"up to now it seems that we will possibly only exceed the border of one trillion crowns owing to the lower deficit for the coming year in the year 2009.
Next year the debts between 900 billion and one trillion crowns should move, "said David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
It sees NEXT Finance similar to Vladimír Pikora, analyst that: "to the excess of one trillion we could come in the course of the yearly 2009.
When exact, depends on the next household, which we not yet.
If it should show up that the situation on the political stage changes, and the politicians should to be ready more save, could last up to the year 2010.
But of such a change I do not go out, "noticed he.
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes particularly from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget.
The national debt financed by treasury bonds, national debenture bonds, direct loans or for example by loans of the European investitionsbank.
The domestic national indebtedness rose this year meanwhile to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debts of the state rose meanwhile by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached at the end of of September 803.3 billion crowns and sank since June by 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
"the joint and several debt rose over the year from first to the third quarter by 13 per cent, which really much is in view of its, as well the economy is.
It is interesting that increasing is to be registered particularly with the debenture bonds, where the increase amounts to 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but on the other hand shows this that one can something undertake, already before the pension reform comes, "commentated Pikora the data.
Better than expects
From the financing strategy and handling the national debt for 2007 it follows that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of of Decembers reduced the Ministry owing to the better development of the national striking stop politics the plan however to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is due particularly to the national budgetary deficit, which will reach this year obviously 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It continues to concern around maximally taken into account means for the consolidation agency at a value of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion-reserve for the payment of the pensions, the financing of treasury bonds for 43 billion and rates for the loans with the European investitionsbank at a value of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a teddybaeren was demonstrated, it today a court in Khartum.
According to indication of her lawyer the British teacher, who had been accused in the Sudan of offense of the Islam, was condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days detention and following classification.
The Britin was accused of six to seven-year-old pupils to have permitted to give to a teddybaeren the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have earned it to be expenditure-whipped.
After parents of pupils had weighted several times at the Sudanese ministry for education and cultural, the 54-jaehrige basic lady teacher, who was active to the Unity High School of Khartum, was at home taken up on Sunday with itself and accused of according to the article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the offense of the Islam.
This affair actually takes its beginning in September, when the teacher requests her six to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the class teddy.
"the children suggest to Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed" eight names, among them, report head master Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class co-ordinates, 20 from 23 children Mohammed select as dearest first names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a first name very frequent in the Sudan.
Subsequently, the children provided a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and to the caption "my name are Mohammed".
The bear did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is completely simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as offense of the Islam.
One of the moslemischen colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, which informs at the same school in the Sudan, explained, he knew her well, and she would have never something would have done, with which she could step too close to a religious faith, "I regrets that she asked the children, for a name to only be correct", its judgement concerns it here only a "innocent error".
An opinion, which numerous pupils of the teacher divide, the this as "very attentively opposite their pupils" and as a "person, who never speaks in the class about religion" describes.
One considers that the first name Mohammed is simultaneous also the secondary name given in Great Britain at the secondly most frequent, for which in English 14 different ways of writing exists.
This of moslemischen families selected first name is often considered as a kind Ehrerbietung at the prophets (it is given frequently to the Erstgeborenen of a family).
But how the rules in the reference to the use of this first name read?
May one give it for example to a toy?
This is naturally a question of the interpretation.
On Wednesday it came during the last negotiation meeting into Vienna to no agreement over the future status of the province.
At the end the miss
The Serbs and Albanian from the Kosovo terminated Wednesday mornings in bathing, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
"it is unfortunate that the parties could come to no agreement over the status", explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger with a press conference into Vienna.
With stress on it that the peace in the region on the play are located, it requested its American counterpart franc Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina to follow its obligations for the receipt of the peace and the discussions also beyond the end of the negotiations to continue.
"no acts of violence in direct future are expected, but we stand at the beginning very difficult time", added it and suggested that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the switchings on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which will meet the European one union, which unites the USA and Russia in itself, on Monday a last mark in Serbia and in the Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited to 90% of Albanian speaking could become clearer, if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane Khartchenko by 10 December its report at the uncertainty advice to submit.
The discussions of bathing, in which proximity of Vienna, formed sixth and last negotiation meeting since the troika August passed from the UN the order to a new switching had received.
Americans and Europeans count on the fact that their order for switching will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the grant of the independence of the Kosovo at the security council, insist on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this final date.
"Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a concerted solution", said Botsane Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After the Kosovo confessed eight years long under administration of the UN, the western countries regard independence under supervision by the European Union as the only solution with future.
Pristina shows up ready to announce these one-sided if the security council should not decide to their favour.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
"regrettably no agreement could be come to", communicated the president of the autonomous authority of the Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in bathing, where for Monday these "negotiations of the last chance" were led.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the kosovarischen rebellion and future prime minister of the province divided its regret.
It added however that the plan suggested of Belgrade belongs one past, which led to murders and Deportationen "to the autonomy to".
"domino effect"

Spectacular repair at the space station
And its comrades of the crew of the international space station (EAT) more than seven hours in space will have used astronaut Scott Parazynski, in order to accomplish the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
_ a dare door, which due to its duration, which distance of habitable module, which speed, with which he organize, and which of the astronaut "tinker" tools, in order the repair accomplish, several record obtain have.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindric part, which was to take up soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind jetty for the module laboratories.
But one must be able to supply it with river.
The second task of the crew was it thus to convert 17.5 tons a heavy module for generation of current over solar collectors, which already on EAT YOURSELF found, in order to bring it into its final position.
After it had shifted it, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span amounts to 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like Akkordeone was damaged by a gotten jammed cable on a length by approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped, in order not to damage the collector still more.
The astronauts, who should repair the space shuttle Discovery originally for a kontrollgang abandoned and then another solar collector, whose rotation system was incorrect, saw themselves forced to dedicate itself to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk at the end of the 30 meters long remote controlled arm of the space shuttle, which at that the station one had attached, around in order the repair to accomplish.
It is one the best "Spacewalker" (Wetraumgaenger) of NASA.
Largely, resistantly, very skillfully, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
The 46-jaehirige learned physician was thus selected, whom "hurt" solar collector "operate".
After it had examined the damage exactly, it split the incorrect cable and fastened a kind rails on the damaged place.
It was supported by a second "Spacewalker", which remained in the proximity of the air-lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin of the crew.
The tool, which it used, a mini hockey stick, with insulator tapes, in order to prevent on the solar collectors, which produce several hundred V, an electrical impact, had the astronauts on board the station devised and "tinkered".
When the action was terminated, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was completely unfolded, before it counted and into the station back turned its tools.
Yesterday the astronauts enjoyed afternoon a half day relaxation, before today seven astronauts turned Discovery on the space shuttle back, in order to presumably begin Wednesday the return flight to the earth.

The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not become exciting during the counting of the urns: The mass of the Russians will decide for president PUT in a party, united Russia.
After a very much blocked election campaign it confirms its striving for stability, even after Autoritarismus.
Russian president Vladimir Putin a message radiated on the public transmitters addresses three days before the parliamentary elections to the voters, who were noted of course, whose contents are however kept secret.
He does this in his characteristic as a leading candidate of united Russia, who a pro Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory announces itself.
Yesterday the president let nothing see through, when he received the foreign Ambassadors, and was satisfied to supply a new point of attack against the Western powers those the interference accused of its favourite topic during the election campaign.
"we know the price of a trueful democracy and expect honest elections, extremely transparent and openly, elections without frauds", added it.
From view of the opposition they have itself there vertan.
It prangert one by suppression stained election campaign.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says, it would have never given, not even "such dirty elections in the time of Eltsin".

"the Russians retained themselves the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus"
After these parliamentary elections without tension two many resuming questions raise themselves:
- who will begin PUT in follow-up as a president?
The office newspaper communicated the date of the first ballot of the presidency elections yesterday, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time until 23 December to make itself well-known.
Since he was selected 2000 and 2004 were red-elect, Vladimir Putin cannot begin for a third mandate in consequence.
And now is no successor.
Which role will play Putin after March?
Prime minister?
Chairman of the majority in parliament and the all-powerful party united Russia, the government and president will select?
Whatever it will be, at the parliament or with the presidency elections, which become past power triumphieren.
That is tradition.
"the Russians retained themselves the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, are not them not master of their fate", mean the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the national university sank Petersburg continues to decrease even still: The civil society developed itself further in this country, which was christianisiert five centuries to Europe, only very slowly; the famous community spirit retarded the development of individuality.
After the liberals Putin tied reforms of the 90's again to the model of a paternalistischen state, which was accepted perfectly by the population, the more, since after this new Paternalismus no terror followed, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie donation means.
Today the Russians "do" "from free pieces without the personal responsibility", which they put after the decay of the USSR briefly to the day.
"consider to which still for a long time?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the commercial world.
And the administrative elite understands it to hold the status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian region chairmen) state the local lists of candidates of united Russia.
The new liberties coming from the west are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 90's.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians will also not be correct for the extremistic parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-jaehrigen Professorin: "consider to which still for a long time?
Those, which are in power, are not so bad, why they replace?"

Still today Arolsen work on more than 300 established ones of ten thousands of personal inquiries in bath.

Is Endjahres aRally approaching for the stock exchange? Disagreement with the experts due to the US US crisiscUs crisis
With scarcely five weeks up to the end-of-year procedure at the stock exchange the investors already rub regarding the coming Endjahres Rally the hands.
Nevertheless the experts can provide in this connection no safe prognoses.
Banif believes that "purely statistically regards, the month Decembers at the stock exchange normally with a positive market tendency accompanies
Nothing the defiance is not advisable it to provide prognoses at short notice and only on the basis from statistics to. Above all not if tensions which can be taken seriously determine the current market happening
Although other experts do not approve such an strong improvement in prices in the last weeks of the yearly, these mark nevertheless that "the market prices of given the liquidity of the market and the market participant is determined. These invest due to the lack of safe share funds mainly in pension fund, which is strongly concerned by the revaluation-running trend to productive net assets.
Therefore according to opinion of these experts the stock exchange rather a rather lateral, from market fluctuations affected course trend to exhibit, "above all because we yet the extents of the possible decrease of the interest rate of the US issuing bank to measure be able, an uncertainty particularly to the risen crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate due is not."
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department with.bpi in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally.
"the chances stand not very well", insure the expert.
The Spanish share index Ibex already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But all experts do not divide the same negative opinion.
In the opinion of Juan Solana, analyst with Intermoney, could lock the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the unit trust fund and the traditional, each year at this time made Bezuschussung of the pension scheme, the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points.
The expert emphasizes nevertheless that this year the things somewhat differently develop could; particularly due to already in the second December week, and therefore directly after the bridge day for the day of the condition, taking place Endjahres Rally.
In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not affect the markttendenzen.
According to estimate of Federico Olucha, analyst with the bank Inversis, find the past evaluations to the market situation on an almost technical level, which could lead to it, "that shortly a deviation from the index values appear could, their extents depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts in the fact that these positively fail.
With the selection of the values, which are to advance the Ibex to new maxima, are itself the analysts united.
Solana of Intermoney protests that "this year the large values at the row are."
Among the value winners the expert would rank the two major banks and some real estate companies, would be to expensive there "the current sector to the given time."
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis insures that the rises in connection will accompany with the bank and industrial sector.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will profit from it.
"the ACS was in the last months on catching up course and we hopes that other real estate companies hit such as Ferrovial and FCC the same way," so the expert.
Regarding the increased consumer behaviour during the Weihnachtstage in the last yearly half the periodic consumption will determine the market happening.
On the other hand the expert that also the technologies will obtain positive sales results, believes even if it on the Spanish market only in small number is represented.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December exhibited sinking course processes only in two cases.
When end of 2003 the technology blister burst, this led the stock exchange from its crisis and initiated at the same time the last material Endjahresrallye.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 caught up around 28,17 per cent points, exhibited December an improvement in prices of 6,68%.

Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutes from on Mondays to on Fridays 12 hours on the day.
Popular decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
Altogether 200 of it is settled in the most economiceconomics regions of Spain.
For Institut, who operates under the label name Popular max, these addresses mean a large milestone.
In addition, for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular represents as a first bankers' syndicate the jump dares to extend and Saturday of 10h to 20.30h set the opening times of its branches of weekday to 20.30h.
The bankers' syndicate BBVA, which is likewise reported the extension of their opening times in the addresses repeated reads, seized so far still no definite resolution.
The to time current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem an agreement to aim at, with which 75% of all branches of Saturday are closed and but at a weekday to open in the afternoon, if also not for customers.
Whether further banks of the new initiative follow will depend, which adapts to the business opening times, on the empirical values of the Popular bank.
And straight that is also the intention, which pursues Popular with its project.
A goal is it to extend the opening times of those branches those due to its layer purchase-merry customers of independent, small and centralconstant enterprises, in addition, those of large department stores to seize can.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, there it around new, but changed opening times does not act.
But the bank will transform the premises of those addresses, which already are in business zones, and them at the same time the individual customer profile of the different zones to adapt.
Thus the extension of the opening times is connected with a new spatial arrangement of the branches, which is characterised by a more current, farbenfroheres Design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera insures the fact that the restructuring does not require larger investments, but with a increased personnel attitude, there a branch would accompany now no longer six, but eight or nine employees needed.
The addresses, which will be equipped even with the additional premises for the KMU, will sell no financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the empirical values failed positively, so Ángel Rivero.
The addresses of the roads Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and the Gran Vía were selected for it which an intelligent resolution seems to have been.
Popular leads momentarily approx.. 2500 addresses.
And further 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and exhibit likewise extended opening times, even at sunning and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used, since most of them instead for the sales will offer a broad selection of non--financial services.
"we would like to represent no competition for our customers", explain Rivero.
With Telefonica they came provisionally to the agreement to sell assistance of external bank personnel of mobile telephones.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles for the first time its stock exchange value and overhauls thus its rival Antena 3.
"we created it."
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, with stock exchange conclusion gave his satisfaction to Paolo Vasile kund. The transmitter led by it had increased its value by double its rival the Antena 3.
An aspect however absorbed its joy: "that is exactly which me is hurt; not that we a higher growth, but that we had smaller losses ", determined it.
It stressed that they did not sink despite the weak market "too deeply."
Telecinco terminated yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54%.
This profit reduces its past losses of this year on 15,66%.
According to data of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euro now, whereby Mediaset controls the principal part of the capital (52 %), and Vocento only with 13% is involved.
The rival Antena 3 lost yesterday 1.52 per cent points and has since January a loss of altogether 40.5% to announce, so that its market value with 2,193.46 million amounts to half.
The market value of other quoted communication enterprises however rises; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million, with Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and with Vocento on 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it concerns "two similar enterprises", so Vasile.
Still the question, in which we can act to extent actually stock exchange-technically, appears uncertain to which price and as we it on customer level to be arranged lucrative can.
Telecinco explained one week ago its project to ascend this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from incomes from advertising. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.
If the project should be converted, the transmitter would increase its advertising income compared with the 965.4 million from the previous year by 3,6%.
In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose around 1,6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while the net income from the television business could exhibit only a rise of 0,7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange process of Telecinco, better in the comparison, with the high Payout Ratio, which the company could exhibit up to the current time: 2006 arranged the enterprise a 100 percent declaration of dividend led by Alejandro Echevarría.
Vasile insures however that the Ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of the portions of end mol, with Mediaset as parent company, nor, even if it is still too early for an official publication.
"we are committed to the official compromise to disburse at least 50% of the portions even if we indicated so far always substantially more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stocks we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the end mol portions.
According to statement of the analysts the market to time exhibits certain loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently its profit calculation with Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of shortening the prospective growth rate, which will decrease/go back 2008 of 10,5% to 8,4% and 2009 of 5,5% to 5,1%.
This lowered also the prospective calculation of profits of Antena 3 for 2008 around 4,5% and for 2009 around 7,5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on his high effective return and his lasting potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) attaches due to the "multiple incentives" and the prosperierenden market a more favourable position than Antena to 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to put expectations back in both cases in view of the "similar threats" (satisfied market and worse restaurant climate)

Its publication corresponds to the principles of euro act and the European central bank (EZB), which aim at a local and a value comparison by the publication of the data to US products.
The prognosis for the indicator can be provided prematurely, by using the same proceeding as with the harmonized consumer price index, but at the same time still various other statistic modelling methods uses, in order to measure at the time of the computation the missing information.

Bono explains itself in agreement, the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, to case of a choice victory to assume in the congress.
The former Secretary of Defense José Bono accepted the offer of the head of the provincial government and Secretary-General of the socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. He will accordingly state the list of the PSOE candidates with the coming general elections to Toledo and, in the case of a choice victory of the socialists, the office of the congress president will transfer.
Thus José Blanco, organization secretary of the PSOE, announced it and Bono in the press conference, after today in the head office of the party a meeting with Zapatero took place.
In opinion of the head of the government the offer is to the former Minister justified, since it is important in the policy ", on the best ones to count to be able" and Bono "under the best ones is."
In addition from the Mancha coming politician in the case of a victory would stand as a candidate for the socialists with the coming elections "to all appearances" as a chairman of the congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as a congress president. This had announced on past 15 November not to begin with the next general elections no more to terminate its career in the public policy and itself to begin instead in the universitaeren range for the climatic protection.
The former Minister had to admit that the head of the provincial government would have pushed since his resignation before two years continuously on his return to the political happening.
Besides referred to it on it that the party, like during the appointment of the vice-president for economics, whom citizen wanted not to withhold, who would transfer the post of the congress president in the case of a choice victory and designated this as a "act of transparency".
If he should actually take over the office, then he hopes the chamber into a "house the respect and not the offense or the shouting" to convert, to let appear ever more similar around her so the "citizens."
"regrettably wins one occasionally impression, as if the only place, in which one cannot talk in Madrid calmly and calmly, is the congress; thus the head of the provincial government in the senate was interrupted once up to 26 times."
At the same time it praised the current president Manuel Martín and "its good work" and suggested, it wants not the appearance to arouse the office to have already taken over since otherwise its political opponent would call this "arrogance".
Climatic propaganda
Since the climatic debate submits of a merciless criticism both the Skeptiker of the climatic change as well as those, which place in this connection a social and political debate into the foreground, the movement as a whole strong co-operation must put to the day.
Above all if it concerns a leader of the movement, that, as in the case of the head of the provincial government Zapatero, the fight against the climatic change considers more important than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests locking a "new contract with the planet".
This suggestion brings it however in explanation emergency concerning acting, and/or non--action of its government, which contributed crucially to the fact that Spain stands within the European Union at the point of the countries, which fulfilled the defaults of Kioto minutes to few.
Who are the responsible persons for the default of the defaults, on which sectors this is to lead back, and why has his government, that had suggested the "contract with the planet", this development not stopped.
In addition it is now forced to state to the Spanish citizens planned by it the measures against the climatic change without.
Which companies will be affected by which is to be changed behavior of the citizens, who individual and collective economy measures must be accomplished and which economic consequences result from it.
More exactly said, who must sacrifice itself and for the rescue of the planet will pay.
However it does not have and it in the future such explanations will give.
Straight because it concerns itself the Aufopfern and paying.
Because the measures, which can be material used against the climatic change, are unpopular.
They are cost-rich, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE appeared Zapatero choice-strategically seen so dangerously that it saw itself forced to take the suggestion back again.
Accordingly it applies now, for the planet with nothing to thus save with pure propaganda and empty sayings without each material consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet must talk otherwise for election campaigns so suitable politicians neither, nor accuse, nor demand, instead however to the fastidious expenditure to follow to decorate and with its sanftmut and quality other one inspire the meetings.
This can happen however only if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and so also it does not give that the bicycle will be allowed itself in the future to the only progressive movement means or we only with a fan erfrischen.

My family doctor presents one of his long, strange research articles with the title to me: "money leads to activation of certain brain ranges, above all, if other more of it get."
Thus the feelings resulting from the monthly salary payment depend on the content of the colleagues.
The study was provided to assistance by a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last expenditure of the science magazine Science.
According to statement Bernd of weber, author of the study and director Bonn brain research centers of the Life&Brain, "the activation was strongest if the participant gave correct answers and its fellow player failed however."
The researchers could recognize the fact that the brain activities failed always very moderately, if both participants with their answer lay correctly and so also the same got content; but if one of them received the double, it came also to a stronger brain activity."
I am not completely safe me whether it requires actually as much scientific expenditure to arrive at such a result.

Which insurance is suitable for me best?
The KFZ insurance, which takes one off of the driver caused possible case of loss, contains a high cost, whose height depends wiederrum on different factors, among other things from age, sex, time of the production of the driving licence, family status, kind of the car which can be insured and its use, etc..
A car to possess is only the beginning.
Because even more with difficulty the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found than the correct vehicle model.
First of all it must be clear one with which we have to do it here.
An autoinsurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurant.
This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract, which specifies the fact that the society receives the agreed upon insurance premium and is in response obligated to submit with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, for which by several factors builds itself up, among other things. Older, sex, time of the production of the driving licence, family status, kind of the vehicle which can be insured or its use.
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that with a higher danger of accident also higher payments of dues become due.
For this reason both over 25-year old and women fewer payments of dues carry out, because statistics must prove that these groups exhibit a smaller accident rate owing to their caution.
The same applies also to married persons, there these according to statement of the statistic values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises, to fewer accidents bends like unmarried ones.
The use, which is attached to the vehicle, impairs the frequency of driving and concomitantly the probability of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more probably the damage.
With the list of the premium the insurance must consider a whole set of points.
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly, in order to select exactly the autoinsurance, which comes to meet its personal needs earliest.
We do not only list the most important points, which one should consider with the selection of an insurance here now, in order one achievement -, to be able to meet but also an price-oriented choice.
Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles, e.g. the small driving experience and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it were best for an ideal insurance protection to lock an insurance against all risks there are nevertheless more inexpensive alternatives.
The careful drivers can select insurance against all risks with self participation, so that the achievements of an insurance against all risks are covered, but offered for a low price.
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted from the damage.
"the amount is specified before conclusion of the contract and on the basis the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly the smaller the sum which can be paid ", explains Luis Noguera, general agent of Spain with roofridge Europe, a switching enterprise for on-line insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damages, not however against the damages developed at the own car.
In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here an advice.
If you are old under 25 years, it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; thus your credit note increases, by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit note is a lowering of the basis tariff with the appropriate insurance company.
In the opposite in addition contain a punishing payment a rise of mentioned tariff.
"the height of credit notes and punishing payments depend their yields on the society and.
If the enterprise has a yield-rich year behind itself, it can take the liberty to increase the bonus payments ", describes Noguera.
As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded, it is to be locked for the drivers more simply a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident rate sinks.
Thus it is most meaningful to decide for an insurance against all risks with self participation.
"normally the young people can draw no use from their past experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving not", describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise, and add that the majority of the accidents in the second practice practice occur, after the "fear of the beginner" was put down.
It is more advisable nevertheless at a married customer, who does not possess children, to lock an insurance against all risks; naturally then only if it also permits the financial situation of the appropriate person.
On the part of the insurers married couples with children apply as the customers with the smallest accident rate, and accordingly low also its payments of dues fail.
In this case an insurance against all risks with self participation (with an amount around the 300 euro) would be the best option. In the case that one received a high credit note, is recommended an extended insurance, which begins only to the third vehicle year.
"you drive altogether more relaxed and possess a larger purchasing power, which permits it to them, a higher payment of dues to set", determine Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it offers itself, an insurance against all risks with self participation (with an amount around the 150 euro), to lock or an extended insurance which begins only with a sufficiently high credit note.
Finally one must note that the autoinsurance is somewhat very important, not only, because she protects the driver from possible accident damages, but also, because she saves high costs, which require it that a thorough selection is met, which corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the point for the round of the last sixteen
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on coming Tuesday in San Siro for the point, which is missing to them, in order to achieve their respective goals still before conclusion of the championsleague before round. The Italians need to arrive the point over at the point of their group, while this decides with the Scots on its participation.
The Italian crew already confirmed already five points and to have their participation in the fifth round with an undecided in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs still another further, in order to go surely that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two plays of the group of D will take place one week before end of the sixth play round, since the FC Milan at the FIFA club world championship in Japan must begin, where it will fight at the 13ten in the semi-final for the first time for the entrance in the final, which takes place on 16th.
Like that this group before all different will be final and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the all-side expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow white, which they in the case of a victory group first will and so that a better starting position in the round of the last sixteen would have.
Of the FC Shakhtar a defeat could be sufficient for the crew of Gordon Strachan around itself qualify even with a Schlappe. Nevertheless he should trust not too much in such circumstances, because at nine points resembling and is entitled to the Ukrainern the participation; those last week in Glasgow had lost (2-1), but with the second play to win could (2-0).
Therefore the May countries will thus try, the Scot the evening to bad. Wiederrum hope to reach for the second time in consequence the round of the last sixteen of the transformed championsleague after they were defeated in the vorrangehenden play season in exactly the same round by a gate by Kaka in the sequel time (1-0) and by zero to zero undecided on the first leg.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the "Rossoneri", the crew will have itself to concentrate on the own play, since both reaching the eighth final and its membership depend with the UEFA on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon would know despite its lower table position and without the prospect to be allowed to participate further in the largest European championship achieve by a victory the third place and along-play thus with the UEFA.

' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) y ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) explained briefly before beginning of their concert in the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that those was "outstanding" the tendency in the reunited volume.
Around 20,000 humans could the concert in the sold off stadium see, with which a video had provided to history that volume, the end of the nineties for sensation, one showed.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album, which contains its largest hits and two further new Songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", and which appear in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls carried golden armlets, which them the married man of "Posh Spice" on the stage, which had given English soccer players David Beckham, before.

New fears over natural gas controversy between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price controversy smolders between the Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports from fuel are impaired to Western Europe.
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European union (European Union) is led by the Ukraine and each controversy between the two nations is observed very exactly.
Kiew has before it warned that if Moscow increases the price, which it must pay for the natural gas, it from Russia higher transit charges in calculation will place.
An earlier conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies into the European Union states.
The recent controversy between Kiew and Moscow happened at a time, to that the Ukrainian government and the Russian, national gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an agreement by means of how much must pay the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in the year 2008.
According to Gazprom the Ukraine must be computed more, there the company agreed up to 50% additionally for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan to pay.
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"it is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states with discussions", said the minister of economics of the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the press agency Reuters.
"the changing natural gas prices should certainly be connected with our arguments concerning the height of the transit charges [ to Western Europe ] by the Ukraine."
In the last large natural gas controversy between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 Gazprom shortened supplies into the Ukraine.
This led in consequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe, which drove the prices drastically up.
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European union.
Russia has the world-wide largest gas occurrences, but remains underdeveloped of it much.
The consequence is that Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other centralasiatic former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The Scottish national health service must improve controls of the police records for employees of outside of Europe, said a member of the control organ outside
The recommendation of the main finance director Robert Black came, after a foreign doctor was brought in Scotland in Zusammmenhang with the notice on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black expressed likewise over the fact doubts that the Scottish national health service has no exact conceptions regarding the number of its auslaendischischen coworkers.
But its report pointed out that other important controls were correctly accomplished with a sample by five health authorities.
The main finance director examined personnel, who was recruited outside of the countries of the European marketing area, in consequence of the notice for the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport, after a jeep was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal.
It was one of three physicians, who appeared in October in the old Bailey in a video transmission, and in connection with the presumed autobomb attack in Great Britain was loaded.
It is expected that the national health service accomplishes controls in the apron of the employment of foreign coworkers, in order to ensure that these the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizing to possess, in order to work in the united kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland for the examination of police records, the agency does not have these information the competence outside of Great Britain to receive.
The report of the main examiner mentioned now, beside other recommendations that the executive committee is to take up guidelines of the extract from police record, employers with controls in different countries helps.
"although we found these in some personnel recordses of referring to these controls, did not become not by routine accomplished." the report determined.
Black said, which Scottish health authorities its investigation guidelines before the employment with high measure would follow, but added: "our report points ranges out, within which the system can be improved, in order to ensure that exact information about the number of foreign health service coworkers is available."
BMA of Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it is "extremely improbable" that investigations in the apron of the employment of potential NHS coworkers would identify humans, who could commit future notices of terror.
"in the report it means that momentary placing in front tests of the NHS Scotland is well to work and it not clearly, which increase in value the recommendations will supply", said it.
The Scottish health authorities say that they have momentarily 1,161 foreign coworkers, the predominant majority of it physicians and nurses.
However the finance director that the number was probably higher, warned also, because the executive committees would have problems to identify those coworkers who are given time off on indefinite time.
The investigation stated further that established inspection procedures kept by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian predominantly its.
In addition passport -, work permit - belongs, and to qualification controls.
the Scottish government examines at present its politics and guidelines for controls before beginning of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said: "it was me a request this work to implement in view of the terrorist attack on the airport Glasgow."
It supplemented the fact that the Scottish government, in connection with the health authorities, which consider recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines would be again-reflected concerning the control investigations in the apron of the employment of all coworkers - under it also those from the foreign country - whose publication next month are planned.

208 arrests in Saudi Arabia because of a Terrorkomplotts
Saudi Arabia uncovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militant ones because of their affiliation to cells, which had planned a forthcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on clergyman and security forceses.
The national television of the world largest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to in-smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of aluminium-Qaida started a campaign against the monarchy, which is since 2003 an allying of the United States, in consequence of the invasion into the Iraq.
A cell by eight militant ones, aforementioned of a foreign citizen, planned a notice on an oil plant in the eastern province, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has to protect 35,000 men a strong fast intervention troop in an educated manner over plant after a failed aluminium Quaida notice on the world largest oil processing installation in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to a innenministerliche explanation, says that 18 of the arresting belonged to a cell, which was led by a "rocket expert", who immigrated illegaly to the country.
It reports that the militant ones would have planned to in-smuggle eight projectiles in the kingdom.
Further 22 of the arrested ones intended according to the report to kill clergyman and security forceses.
The government has to do clergyman warned more to together-add in order to stop Saudis, those after Iraq strives around itself with aluminium Qaida militias who want to fight the allied armed forces and the US-SUPPORTED schiitische Muslim government, that is regarded of hard liner under the sunnitischen Saudis as ketzerisch.
Aluminium Qaida militias regards many clergyman being located in Saudi Arabia as in co-operation with the authorities in the support of the policy of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - are accompanied of calls of Osama shop, the aluminium Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to aim at it the pro-Western Saudi government - foresaw it on foreign populated areas, government buildings and plants of the energy sector.

Under the arresting were also 32 people, which were accused of the militias financial support to have made available.
The climate on the Venus could show a view on the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to the life, said scientists yesterday.
Data of a European spaceship present at an orbit show the fact that the planet resembles a turned away twin of the earth still more than so far was conscious.
The Venus is the naeheste planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds possess approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is somewhat closer.
Before billions of years on the Venus conditions would have prevailed, which would have been very similar to those on earth and even habitably, believed scientist could have been today.
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect without brakes, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun exposure and a slower rotation speed the Venus hit completely different development course.
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature, which is hot enough, lead to melt and by hurricane-strong hoists and lightning towers is devastated.
The realizations of the space probe Venus express of the European space travel agency, which planned for one year examined, offer a ernuechternden view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climatic changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics at the University of Oxford, one the director/conductor of the Venus express mission, said: "it becomes clear, why the climate on the Venus to that earth is so different, while the planets are rather similar otherwise."
"our new data make it possible to design a scenario in which the Venus before billions of years began like the earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"enriched uranium" of the police seizes
A Kilo radioactive material, according to reports enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the slowakischen and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material is examined.
It confirmed not, whether it concerned enriched uranium, but said that for 1 million dollar (480.000 Pound) are sold could.
Everything still openly
Memo Romey said, it did not keep it worthy a presidency candidate by a schneemann to be asked.
Nevertheless the republican explained itself candidate for the presidency in the long run ready to place itself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters questions on video accepts and submits, in order it the candidate to send.
None questions, which were at the Wednesday evening, which 28 November, were raised, as ridiculously as the schneemann, which asked democrats over the global heating up in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this mark exactly the condition of the republican party, which breaks open into the elections in the next year.
It is not well-known, exactly like the producers of CNN, which every now and then-supported the debate, which to YouTube showing tie-clips selected the beginning candidate.
However in the first half hour of the debate, which was dedicated longest to an individual topic, immigration stood in the center.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters a dial to serve, if they heard things, which pleased them: The TV organization noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national outrider, and Romney, which pushed themselves forward in the crucial inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake the call off, it regarding illegal immigration was flexible, when he was a mayor of New York.
It attacked Romney in which it the former governor von Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for work on its house to have adjusted.
The two argued particularly violently as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (would give the illegal ones a regular status and the possibility on the nationality).
Unbedeutendere candidate such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressional representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congressional representative from Colorado, succeeded to after-hook it with this topic.
None of the two men has serious chances with nominating, but both remain in running, perhaps because they gehauen in former times and harder as others on the immigration bass drum have.
At least within the range of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance opposite illegal Migranten.
This topic, together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other concerns over the remainder of the world, helps to forget the republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservative ones or minimize.
But the debate was brought clearly problematic as other topics to the language.
Mr. Giuliani was asked, why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be regarded as torture.
One the interrogator asked whether the candidates believed each word of the Bible.
This led to the fact that Giuliani held the point of view that although the Bible was its preferential book he the history of Jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recently accomplished inquiry in Iowa owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty was necessary painfully, but.
When it was pushed on it whether Jesus would endorse it, he laughed over and said Jesus was too intelligently for itself for a political office to be applied.
Running remains unusually far open.
Huckabees ascent in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and its applause storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are not high-shot from that anything, because the two wings of the party could not agree so far yet on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and convincingly united with a victorious message over the size of America and a Zwinkern to both wings of the party.
This mark is split the party and the result is by far not clear.
Pain of the labour party
Gordon Brown discovered still another further pit for falling; its way from this remains the same one.
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, have been paid no politician Paris hotel bills, gelutscht no except-conjugal toes.
But uncovering that enrich businessman donations for the British governing labour a party over more than 650,000 Pound (1,3 million dollar) over four years under the name of other people masked, and that the party missed to announce this is something without that contested Gordon Brown well expenditure-come would be.
When two months ago ago the Prime Minister had extracted itself from the demand after a choice, in daemliche way the intelligence of the British insulting, by maintaining that public opinion polls would not have affected this decision, gave it hope that he would offer a durable, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, which expressed increasingly astute agency chairmen that liberally democrat, it, the once which was afraid Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean developed.
The awkward rescue a bank fastened by Northern skirt, showed regulatorische weakness and bad faculty of judgement under bombardment.
Badly thought out suggestions on the change of the tax laws enterprise federations against the government applied.
The taxofficial loss of personal data of 25 million humans pointed inconceivable administrative Pfuschereien out.
A Trio of generals in the retirement started a rebellion in the upper house from protest against shortening of military expenditure: Ministers of the armed forces to be, then maintained them, are a partial time job.
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) already withdrew.
Nothing of the fact means that Brown retires irrevocablly direction breaks open.
Governments can reach a turning point, after them it nevertheless not possibly feel to govern.
Neither nor humans may trust politicians, but normally hold back them their skepticism, if a new troop seizes the office.
If it is clear that it is improbable that a prime minister improves the situation, and it does not even need for a long time thereby to be, is this delay past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet Ministers begin too plaudern; the press looks for bad messages; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because it cannot state contrary to other political leaders, to be a new broom.
So gladly he would deny Tony Blair, was he its first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern skirt and the tax competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions, which Brown made as a chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if that were not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - how with the long "money for Adelstitel" investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume it was it.
Nevertheless Browns situation is not completely so bad, as she looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible, as the conservative ones describe them.
As is the case for Mr. Bean, nobody died, or completely one beschwindelt.
And the remedy, like it to be painful likes, is to be delivered, what Browns naturally stalinistische tendencies to have always promised: A reliable, solidly and easily brutal government.
The new Getue around political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams, which compares its donations with its non-profit gifts, does not say he wishes public acknowledgment for his sympathetic consideration.
That may be perhaps like that, but the decision over it was not entitled to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contribution payers are clear and them exist for a clear reason: the public has to know a right to it, who can buy entrance to those, which govern the country.
Watt, which says he would have of Abrahams agreement known, but not that she is illegal, naturally some questions it will have itself to place; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours main financial A driver, to which about the strange donations in October one told.
But so far Brown is not involved: There is nothing that on the fact it points that he knew from these confusion, although the largest part of the payments was made after his taking office in June.
So far the prime minister settled half of the work.
He condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full, from a bishop in the retirement and a judge.
In this case are not very complicated "from it to pulling teachings".
If the law were broken, it is a thing for the police.
Refrained from it there are other things to make the Mr. Brown must, to find how something a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in the public life, that is vacant for six months, and to in front-walk with a thorough reform of political party financing.
That would require bitter pills for a party comrade from the hard liners of the labour with the conservative ones to cooperate and the special financial relationship up with the trade unions to possibly give - such as Mr. Brown.
But it should be conscious some parteiischen facts.
The conservative ones have now a clear guidance in the public opinion polls; it has to recover two years around voters; and the only way, as it can reach a victory, is by indisputable honesty and solid authority.
Map sharks
Does the credit crisis stick on America credit card market?
If blood is in the water, is it is only natural that dorsal fins whirl excited.
Now where of Americas is ailing property market, the raubtiere have the credit card market of the country in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs count on the fact that the credit card losses could 99 billion dollar reach, if the infection danger of under-financed credits spreads on other forms of using credits.
Signs of the strain are clearly visible.
There are rises both with the writing off and with the default rates, which measure the portion of the credits, which are too late not in each case retractably or more as 30 days.
The HSBC announced in the last month that she took 1.4 billion dollar collection of charges from their American consumer financings, partly because of the weakness of credit card takers.
It is nevertheless too early, in order to purge in panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to the Ratingagentur Moody almost was the third quarter default rate of 3.89% a full per cent point below the historical average.
The degradation with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors.
A change in the American private insolvency law laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of declarations of bankruptcy, which constitute again for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of registrations (and thus default fees) again it would rise whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not.
The industry reports also of solid payment rates, which show, how much of their debts the consumers pay to each month off
and the confidence into credit card-based securities is rather strong, despite the stop in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research enterprise, counts on the fact that the expenditure quantities will be higher for 2007 in the long run 25% than last year.
There are surely direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more probable that consumers take up credit card debts, now that home of one's own credits drain.
The map exhibitors look however on the cash flow instead of on present values, therefore falling house prices release not necessarily a change in the credit-worthiness of the applicant for the credit.
They can be of advantage even for the map exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers for paying the raterate rates further sink, if the real estates are less value than the value of the loan; as result the map debts under the repayment priorities become more important.
Map exhibitors can react also many faster and more flexibly than credit givers to the stormier conditions, by changing interest rates or credit borders.
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast re-valuation of net assets.
"we will wake up not a daily and the loans evaluate completely again", say Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main financial adviser.
Even if a sudden understocking crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting wing over are substantially material.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction America will certainly stand into the recession urge, the industry before a grimmigeren future.
Hold they for far look out for these shark fish fins.
British Baenker admits itself guiltily in the case Enron
Three British Banker, which should be provided for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main financial leader by Enron, Andrew Fastow, before court, changed their requests in guilty in Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for alleged Colluding with Fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000, in order to enrich itself at expense of their employer, for innocent pleaded.
The procedure had been set on January.
But during a hearing before court before US district judges Ewing who flax junior pleaded to everyone for a case of fraud using telecommunications means guiltily.
The three former high-level personnel of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal bank OF Scotland Group PLC, became known in Great Britain in the course of distribution procedures, which took two years.
In the United States their case is a loose end of an investigation, which was started after Enrons collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally submitted against it in the year 2002 drew the attention of Fastow to the fact that it was the goal of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron fall.
The accusation against the Banker - called the "NatWest three" - stated, they came in the year 2000 to Houston, over fraudulent komplott with Fastow and its former Topberater a Michael Kopper out hedges.
Greenwich Natwest had invested into a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, which was an architect of innumerable fraudulent Enron machinations, which contributed to it to tear the company in bankruptcy-wobble.
At the beginning of of 2002 had the bank the value their participation in the subsidiary on zero estimated, but the three British men knew that she had substantial value in reality.
An enterprise under Koppers control acquired the portions of the bank of the subsidiary for 1 million dollar.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollar for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the accusation Fastow falsely represented opposite Enron that the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollar at Greenwich NatWest for its portions of the subsidiary.
But actually went the 20 million dollar to the British bankers, Fastow and different.
The bankers received 7,3 million dollar, during Fastow, Kopper and others about 12,3 million dollar absahnten, according to the accusation.
In January 2004 Fastow admitted itself in two charges on conspiracy for its role in of the Enrons failure guiltily.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow serve a 6-jaehrige term of imprisonment in the federal prison of Louis IANA.
Kopper serve a punishment of three years and one month in a mechanism in Texarkana.
Everyone of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollar bail, which made it necessary that they lived in the United States in expectation of the legal proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh-largest enterprise of the nation, zerbroeckelte in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of buchhalterischen do not cheat any longer longer the billion-debts to mask or profitable could appear let schwaechelnde enterprises.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more as 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollar of pension plans out.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairmen of the board Jeffrey Skilling last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse were condemned.
Skilling serve a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays condemnations for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became futile, after he deceased last year because of heart illness.
Not completely down in Moscow
The price of an airplane of the mark Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range, in order to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is with at least 54 million dollar.
But that is change for some the rich Russians.
"it offers place for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"however none of you asks the many seats, because it is for a private family or an enterprise president."
Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand on last Friday during the millionaire exhibition, a four-daily Orgie of consumption placed to the schau, which was organized in an interlocked exhibition center at the outskirts of a town of the capital.
Additionally to Gulfstream more than 200 had developed other luxury offerers of booths, for it hoping, to interest again to money Russians come in everything of Mahagoni getaefelten yachts up to diamond-covered autocrickets, which would be appropriate for 50 cent.
Firer took carefully a shining orangenen Porsche at the next exhibition booth in the visor.
"that is a beautiful car, but it is change in the comparison with us," said it.
"to the United States Russia is the second largest market for private airplanes."
Heated up from an oil boom the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its gloss times.
"we are gone through the same phase into the 1890ern, as if some Americans to gigantic wealth came and into crowds to Europe went, where they were regarded Goldman, a scientist at the Davis center for Russian and eurasische studies at the Harvard university as materialistic", said Mars-resound.
Like the Saudi Arabian over fliers of the 1970er and the Japanese into the 1990ern, the Russians step out as the freigiebigen money output unit most visible in the world.
The most exclusive luxury marks look for their portion of gold fever.
Elsewhere in Moscow in this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, tightened the chairman of LVMH, in order to exchange ideas over it how one can sell hochpreisige goods on markets such as Russia.
(the conference is heard organized by The internationally Herald Tribune, those the New York Times company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who possess altogether 282 billion dollar, according to the Forbes list of richest humans.
Beyond that 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, who are together 670 billion dollar worth, according to a study over the development of private possession in the former Soviet Union, which was written to an expert committee by experts of economic politics of the center for economics and financial research, here.
(the World Bank says that in the year lived 2005 15.8 per cent of the Russians under the subsistence level.)
"there are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore are we all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and Vermarktungsrepraesentantin of David Morris, a Londoner juwelier.
It had for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the mark, the Soho Jewelry Group, which visits fair.
"the women are maintained all exemplary and the men are worth all a fortune."
While they draw Sunday night in evening clothes by resounding, two call themselves real estate agent inside, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked after the cars and I try between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche to decide", said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes, which carried it, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to aim at it primarily new realms, the type of mark-conscious Russian buyers, who would be ready to visit several hours in the back-up to be located around a zugiges depot the geschmachloserweise Cadillac Escalades, taschenmesser from platinum, Moevenpick Eiskrem, custom-made Billiardti, Appartments in Dubai and Gund the teddybaeren placed next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44,57 dollar).
"the Russians are to be learned interested in it, which mark is the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at an exhibition booth of the Netherlands porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a wind-large Imitat of a rem Brandt picture from handpainted, blue mosaic stones.
"natural are interested Russian more in Klimper Klimper."
Indeed the dealers say here the fact that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old after Russian standards) already induced themselves numbers of items limited from grossspurigen Logos to the kind of sober marks with, which did not mark themselves out with a commercial show became.
Nevertheless several thousand humans pushed whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists each day by resounding.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on last Thursday novel said Ershov, which general managers of King Koil beds here, he would have two 70,000 dollar mattress set, manufactured from silk, Kashmir and cotton, with inserted gold threads, sells.
Likewise in the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto said, to a company the High end cars with High end alarm systems equips that its company had sold the sharp orangenen Porsche for 170,000 dollar to a Russian millionaire.
Up to the Sunday afternoon, said Andrei Karapetian, which president of L.A. Connection, an enterprise, which adapts luxury cars on customer's requests, he would have three motorcar radiator cricket for a Rolls-Royce phantom, which resembled linked with one another chain bracelets, for in each case 55,000 dollar sold.
It showed a reporter a motor-car tire, which was developed for a Russian owner of casino, with spokes, which it had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so that it looked like a Rouletterad.
The costs: 22,000 dollar for a four-replacement.
"the Russian millionaire, who or a picture of the face of its wife from cubic zirconium bunch leather wheels would like to have, will not drive necessarily on these wheels", said Mr. Karapetian.
"it will keep it in its 30 or 40-Wagen garage."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said, the cliche "Russiche of millionaires" momentarily not much exclusivity would express, in view of the rise of the local real estate prices.
"if you bought before three or four years a dwelling in Moscow, are them probably already to millionaire, at least on the paper, if already in cash", did not say it.
"there are more from those than you believes."
Those, which were not millionaires could do at least in such a way, as if they would be rich at conditions, which were operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian administration of an estate enterprise.
The enterprise had four red telephone boxes after British model set up, was full-plugged with mountains of wrong million-dollar lights.
Azad Karryev, the director of marketing of the enterprise, said its coworkers 500,000 wrong notes for the millionaire fair would have printed out.
Passanten stopped to put in order to throw the heaps of money to leave mobile telephone photos, while they back-lean in the midst of the spare wealth, of friends knipsen or simply in order a few millions in.
"seeing you, in Moscow can feel everyone like a millionaire", said Mr. Karryev.
Bungled operation assumes with death in new jersey
It was the day before the harvest thank celebration as Ronald Livingston by the large glasfenster of the Just A Little Healthier restaurant saw here and observed like an ambulance to the white Cape Cod two doors of far down at the west Scott Avenue continued.
Soon thereafter was there a police car.
And then was there a further.
"then I saw the box cars of the medical Leichenbeschauers approaching", said Livingston, a surpervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"that was the point as I knew that someone had died."
The Behoeren experienced that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was, a female assistant of the director of the Newarker of polizeidezernats.
Now the Ermittler tries to determine whether she died because of a procedure, which was accomplished by a not certified, cosmetic surgeon the police did not identify, and which in the house on the west Scott Avenue 212 worked.
The authorities do not have yet determined which Mrs. Arroyos death caused, and are hopeful that toxokologische investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks will help, to clear a mysterioesen death up which sent mourning by the Fuehrungspitze of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo was since September 2006 a female assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, and their voice was many in the department well-known.
"you loyal, working and persistent", said Mr. McCarthy was hard about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"you was my pit bulletin.
It protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the Mrs. von Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer, who works for the Alkoholkontrollkomission, and that her leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the public prosecutor von Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that Ermittler would try to determine, whether Arroyo deceased as result of a not certified, surgical treatment.
"that is one of the possibilities", said Mrs. Walsh.
"it is a current investigation."
The authorities said it at the house around approximately 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November arrived.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was explained locally for death.
More than one week passed and the authorities few about her investigation communicated or about the owner of the house, who is specified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs. Castro was asked by the authorities.
The Ermittler tries to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door at for Mrs. Castros house, where a withered rose bush is located in the scarce vorgarten and a Dalmatiner behind the house barks.
A blue barrel marked with "ethyl vanillin" - uses as a replacement for vanilla in food and Parfums - sat in the parking lot beside a door, which led into the basement.
Two Mountainbikes hung of hooks on a side.
McCarthy said that as he arrived for the first time at Newark, after he had spent 25 years with the New York police section was Mrs. Arroyo of inestimable value and helped it thereby in the provinziellen and hard political culture in its new city to get along.
"said you, must ' you to this or that pay attention '", said he.
"was you always here, when I arrived here and it was always here, when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank the interest to lower will lead to the rise of the world stock markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantiks, after market hopes that the central bank will try the credit markets by further reductions of the rate of interest to calm down, by appeasing comments by the vice-chairman of US central bank was encouraged.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and in completely Europe after Donald punt, which number 2 of Ben Bernanke, it said chairmen of the central bank to which that the policy had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuous pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort, Kohn, the recent turbulences said verdriessliche markets to calm down, in view of of indications of rising credit tensions "some the improvements of the market functions of the late part Septembers and Octobers would have partly turned around".
If the increased turbulence should existing remain, it became the possibility of a further aggravation of the financial conditions for consumers and to increase, he said enterprises.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize with new capital syringes into US of markets and possible further reductions of the rate of interest the credit conditions.
The remarks helped to calm down also the barrier Street, in view of of further bad messages from the US economy, the sales of US real estates a new record low in October reached now there.
The consequences of the financial turbulences became of the announcement of Bear Stearns, which Investmentbank underlined, that them 650 jobs, or 4 per cent of their world-wide employees will eliminate, in a measure for cost reduction, in order to adjust heavy losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places in London will disappear, where the bank employs 1,500 coworkers.
In New York the Dow Jones industrial index jumped around 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, in order to close with 13.289,40, while the S&P broad-put on 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent.

The pressure on the bank of England to follow US central bank and the European central bank and feed further capital means into the money markets into London, rose, when one saw the credit tensions the three-monthly "Libor" rates rising for borrowing between UK banks with 6,59 per cent to its highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts with decision over the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, everyone of it nearly just as with difficulty as the other one.
Who is to strike Owais Shah as number 6 for England in Kandy on this weekend, or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevantly in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important, because David Graveney, which is a choice chairman, on call at least under this special title, here, in order to decide to help the coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan thereby, and because itself the table of High Morries, which English acting director, gradually with applications for national offices for voter fills, if not even for which in partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth racquet position, will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport is undoubted it.
It is never simply, exact festzunageln, which makes humans possible the point its branch of profession to reach, while somebody else never beyond lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the kricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are subjective at the end always.
Is it to be ascended the correct time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he it does?
The same can be asked perhaps also in a wider range whether for example John Edward or "Tubby" Banerjee, both should be carried intelligent young high-level personnel with good conclusions, which know the business well.
Who can say, what the correct class for a Kricketspieler is, it is, it the possibility is given to swim or go down.
Of course numbers have a large influence on decisions, but chances have this also.
Within a team a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain at the correct time, if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must regular chances on the order gets, if he wants to make impression as an one-day Kricketspieler.
The eyes of the choice devices to catch is more complicated.
There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, than James Anderson one were, which will apparent play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison kegelt itself for healthy avowedly and like the wind into the nets.
Anderson one took 32 first-class Wickets with ever 33 of run, in order to earn a position in this route.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their points of gloss and to hope for still more.
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, only one opinion question can be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it makes little difference perhaps nevertheless.
Before four years in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty in each test played and was successfully in first, with five Wickets and 40 of useful run, it was however Paul Collingwood, at that time fighting for itself to be still strengthened, the break-through to an important Testkricketspieler created and that, although he scored a double one hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is probable that Graveney, Vaughan and moorland, after a further discussion in the course of the today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow their conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs larger experience over Boparas juvenile enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speak its sparkling and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, which is seven years younger with 22 years, and a exzellente balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten of run in its two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, for its homeland arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate refusal of the choice devices as Vaughan was healthy in order to take its position back for the next play, seems the momentum from its striking to have taken which was obvious still in Bombay.
In contrast to it the Jack of all trades from Essex has schaufelweise joy of life.
It is impressed and its attitude off of it on the point was brought of nothing on a Kricketplatz, when it had estimated recently a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen.
It probably suffered smaller injuries and a shock, but first, which he did, was to be taken out its Vodafone (naturally also gesponsort) and to be called its team colleague Alastair Cook, which had observed this from the distance to say and with enthusiasm: "haste you that seen?".
Bopara is a many better field player, he kegelt its central speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with zuversicht and fate.
The correct man to select a thing is to select the correct time another.
Perhaps that is the actual art of the selection.
To give I slope in addition Bopara now its chance, what does not mean that Shah will not stand there perhaps nevertheless well, if, as the dte set from Ceylon suggests, it is that, which will play this weekend here.
Penalty refugees bring back to the work - and around aluminium-Quaida to fight
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees made of Syria arrived at Bagdad yesterday, with a river of refugees, whose funds or Visas ran out, and others, which hoped that the city returns to normality.
Some were to be fought even returned around the rebels, who had driven it out from their houses.
At the bus station Mansour, before the arrival of 800 humans from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen penalties, was the terminals operation SAM with refugees from Syria and Jordan, who had returned in private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria, after they had killed, said many physicians in Bagdad" Sabah aluminium-Qubaisi, a sunnitischer physician.
"I returned today, because of what I had seen on the television and which I read in the newspaper, over what happened in Bagdad, and like it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army stopped, humans to kill ", said it, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada when addr, arranged its forces to the current time back to place.
Qassim aluminium Atwani, a 38-jaehriger of schiitischer teachers from the predominant sunnitische part of Amariyah, returned with its both children, because he could not renew its Syrian visa and because the regime Iraqi illegally to work.
To say its schiitischen neighbours in Amariyah called it, in order it that a local, of which militia supported contributed the USA to drive aluminium-Qaida out from their bastion in the west of the capital penetrated and him to the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a sunnitischen and schiitischen trunk, which had been sold from its house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with hand grenades, after it had requested its fellow citizens for fight aluminium-Qaidas.
It was returns, in order to fight.
"two days ago it called me some my friends and said to me that they began the Anti-Al-Qaida-militia in Sleikh and that my support and those of my boys need it.
That is why I today returned ", said Sabaah aluminum Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing peace in the capital since the US troop increase and growth more locally "groups citizen concerned", who defends armed and in co-operation with the American military their boroughs.
But more spoke of it, home by visa problems and triumphing funds in Damascus to have been forced, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi in the last years had fled.
Salaam aluminium-Samarrai, a 51-jaehriger threefold father, expressed the general suspicion under the Exilanten to force that Nouri aluminium-Maliki, the schiitische Prime Minister, which had asked Syrian government to impose restrictions of visa for the refugees in order humans to the return.
More than two and a half million humans probably from the sektiererischen Todesschwadronen in the country fled.
"we were well to aluminium-Maliki Syria visited and the government pushed to the Iraqis no more visas to give, around it to the return to the Iraq to force", said the sunnitischen pensioners.
"I cannot trust a government, the criminal ones supported, those my house down-burned, after I went away."
A part of the reason for the decrease of the force is that Sunniten from schiitischen populated areas were driven out in reverse and, which led to the creation of many places, where tensions diminished.
There are fears that a sudden inflow of refugees sektiererische tensions will again schueren and it to conflicts will come.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest Land of the Federal Republic is prominent during the professional training and shines even with the international adjustment of its universities.
Only in an education field the Saarlaender presses the same deficit as the remainder of the country.
"I have ' yesterday to 50. Times it explains to a Nichtsaarlaender that we are not Frenchmen "- this slogan plakatiert the smallest Land of the Federal Republic ironically to its 50. Birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a large role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in the education formation of the institute of the German economy Cologne (IW) on place five.
Thus the universities cooperate already from tradition closely with the neighboring countries.
The university in Saarbruecken was created 1948 by the Frenchmen.
Until today studying can lock here their study with a double or even three-fold diploma.
The portion of foreign studying with 15,6 per cent is accordingly high.
But also the Saarland brings the national children in above average number to the universities - many of them without a conclusion at the High School.
"in the Saarland one uses the vocational education system", says Axel Pluennecke, education expert with the IW.
More as each fifth young person acquires its study authorization at a vocational school, thus lies the Saarland more than seven per cent points over the Federal average.
Also the combination options of vocational and academic training are comparatively fully developed.
On the total population the equipment with binary courses of studies the secondarybest is based in Germany.
Despite the training in line with standard usage and rising demand the number of graduates of engineer sank in the past years however around a third.
Therefore the Saarland education Ministry engaged the universities now to a marketing campaign for engineer-scientific fan.
"at the general-forming schools we activated, say some reforms according to the first Pisa study" a spokeswoman of the education Ministry.
Thus the government introduced country-wide comparison tests.
So that the children in former times the last Kita year is to be learned to begin free of charge - a model, which in the meantime also different Lands of the Federal Republic copy.
Whether the achievements of the pupils improve lastingly will show, only future comparative studies.
With Pisa 2003 shrank the portion of the risk pupils of 29 to 20 per cent.
Altogether the Saarland did not increase however as strongly as other Lands of the Federal Republic.
Bavaria count better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlaender Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured with Pisa - within this range one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is at High Schools obligation - are even if the Saarlaender no Frenchmen.
Chávez changes the clocks over
In Venezuela the clocks tick shortly differently than in the remainder of the world.
On 9 December president Hugo Chávez lets the zeitmesser in the South American country turn back around a half hour.
In Spain Chávez becomes meanwhile the joke figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela communicated, according to a new law the clocks are adjusted to the world time minus four and one-half hours.
Thus the suedamerikansiche state gets a time belt, which gives it in no other country in the world.
The USA-HOSTILE Chávez justified its decision among other things with the fact that the United States of the world would have imposed the organization into time belts to full hours.
Besides Chávez quit the breaking off of the relations with the neighboring country Colombia on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair announced.
The link nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president remained of Colombia, it neither with the head of state nor with the Colombian government relations is maintained.
"I cannot already alone because of mine will", said to Chávez, which advances a constitutional reform, over which the citizens of the oil producing country on Sunday in a referendum co-ordinate must.
With the reform he would clearly develop his power in the country.
Trip of the controversy was the decision Uribes to extract from Chávez the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia with whom it went around the release from hostages.
Uribe has Venezuela with its decision "in the face spat", Chávez on Sunday had criticized.
Also in Spain Chávez is in all mouth.
A new mobile phone-klingelton provides in the country for sensation: "Por qué NO width unit callas" (why you do not hold the mouth) reads the sentence, which already multi than one half million humans from the InterNet downloaded themselves.
Spoke it of Spain king Juan Carlo, who was on the youngest Iberoamerika summit of the constant interruptions of the Linkspopulisten gene FFS and had driven this over the mouth.
Germans 2007 wage minus threaten
Despite the strong economic situation according to a prognosis this year a real wages loss threatens German employees.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a computation of the Hans Boeckler donation the persons employed could count 2007 material on less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"debt to it are the modest wage development, the value added tax increase and the price thrusts with food and energy", said Gustav horn of Institut for makrooekonomie and market research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New loads could come also during the unemployment insurance to employees.
Ministers of Finance Peer stone-bridge said the "new Osnabruecker newspaper", the planned sinking of the unemployment insurance on 3,3 per cent to the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However the federal agency may not come for work again into embarrassment to have to ask with the federation for credits or subsidies the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was become known that the price explosion drove the inflation rate with food and petroleum products on the highest conditions for 13 years.
The prices rose altogether in the comparison between years by 3,0 per cent.
Venus is the hoellische twin of the earth
The Venus is more similar despite their life-hostile atmosphere of the earth than so far meant: The European space probe "Venus express" discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind eddies to Poland, how they arise in the winter also on earth.
For nearly three decades scientists assume that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" furnished the proof - it sought out electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightnings on the Venus shoot at a value of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, report Christopher Russel of the University OF California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory" lightning let the life on earth develop: Thunderstorms are to have reactions lively, which led to the formation of amino acids in the ocean, the components of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "if it ever lives gave there, must have been it in very early history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there might be something alive on the surface of the Venus hardly: The atmosphere is approximately hundreds times more closely than on earth, it prevails every now and then to temperatures of 500 degrees.
"the Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth, but she is a twin", said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, hit so completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since beginning of the nineties no more probe was particularly for the study of this planet on the way.
The newest research results, which are presented now in several "Nature" articles, do not only underline the singularness of the Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system.
"you show also that the thing in common of our neighbour planet with the earth is larger than first accepted", communicate the Esa.
Thus the researchers beside that found already admitted to eddy wind at the north pole also a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which turns still substantially faster.
The phenomenon reminded of air flows on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The secondaryinternal planet of the solar system has nearly the same mass as the earth and is nearly just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
Also as tomorrow or evening star marked planet circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun.
It turns however many more slowly around itself: A Venustag takes 243 ground connection days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly of the earth reminds, scientists assume both planets under completely similar conditions developed.
On both water collected, which remained on earth in oceans, on which Venus however into space was lost.
And during carbon dioxide on earth, constitutes it is fixed in carbonate rocks on the Venus the majority of the atmosphere.
Charcoal burner defends Merkels meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Koehler requires an end of the party controversy over the receipt of the Dalai Lama in the chancellorship.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD because of their attacks on the Kanzlerin after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst charcoal burner worries itself around the reputation of Germany and the large coalition requested to terminate the controversy over the receipt of the Dalai Lama.
"we should present no split nation to the external world in this question", said charcoal burners to the trade paper.
Charcoal burner at the same time signaled understanding for the receipt of the Dalai Lama by Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"the human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the variability of the cultures", said charcoal burners.
Everyone knows that Germany in the foreign policy must protect sensitive Balancen, stressed the Federal President, took however Merkel before the reproach in protection, it operates new China politics.
"the Bundeskanzlerin does not have distance taken from the traditional in China politics.
White also China ", said charcoal burners.
Minister of foreign affairs franc walter stone Meier (SPD) had shown indirectly displeasure over the receipt of the Dalai Lama and from numbers of the union had therefore been attacked.
Stone Meier had deplored among other things the "shop window politics" of the union in the foreign policy.
To the receipt of the Dalai Lama in the chancellorship it came to violent irritations in the GermanChinese relationship.
Thus the Chinese guidance has not only the German Minister of Finance Peer stone-bridges (SPD) unloaded, but after information MIRRORS also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the State Departments of both countries.
Of China head of the government whom Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel has Jiabao now requested to admit the receipt of the Dalai Lama as errors.
China rejects it, if European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of the Tibeter, affirmed whom Jiabao the Chinese position.

Schaeuble warns of riots as in France
Road battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns of riots as in France.
Everything, thus social discontent in Germany must be done not in force on the road unloading themselves, did not demand the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot with shotguns at the police: After the heavy youth riots in France Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) in Germany is afraid a similar development.
"we must make certain that not also with us social explosive develops itself and unloads in force.
We must take that seriously ", said he" to the new press appearing in Hanover ".
Not each young humans get along with the fast change of the social reality.
Federation, countries and municipalities worked already with reproduction to diminish problems said Schaeuble.
References not only the integration of Migranten.
"from the integration summit to the conference of Islam that shows already first successes."
For 'all-clear' signal it is however too early.
Schaeuble pointed out at the same time that it does not give problems concerning town construction and sociological in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris young people had supplied themselves heavy road battles with the police in the past nights.
Also in Toulouse cars and public buildings burned.
Meanwhile the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat demanded larger integration efforts of the Federal Government.
In view of the riots in France Kolat before "imitation effects" warned.
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
There is action need however nevertheless.
Kolat referred to the fact that the unemployment ratio was "above average high" with young people with migration background under 25 years.
It must be provided particularly for more training places.
Kolat stressed: "we must give a perspective to the young people."
The chairman of the Turkish municipality added however, in Germany finds more than in France "social control in the families instead of".
Many young people with migration background wanted besides not that to destroy, which their parents developed here.
Kolat reminded: "however nevertheless we must watch out."
One must give "fast the possibility to the young people, at work and training of participating".
Meanwhile it remained in the night in that Paris suburb Villiers le Bel to a large extent calmly.
Groups of one hundred of the police were in the use, a helicopter flew over with headlights the area.
The responsible authorities announced three arrests as well as a few burning garbage pail and car.
Since the vortag a quantity of approximately 1000 safety forces provides for peace.
The police will so for a long time reach through, as it is necessary, announced interior minister Michelle Alliot Marie after an attendance in the suburb.
At the night on Tuesday with riots in Villiers le Bel approximately 80 policemen had been hurt.
In the consequence eight unrests spread to Toulouse.
The riots caught fire from a traffic accident, with which on Sunday two young people had died.
After first realizations of the public prosecutor's office the police does not carry a debt at the death of the young people.
In the realm of Angela cloud
_ the out of touch with reality appearance the Kanzlerin document, that the coalition contentwise to end be - and that of it nothing more expect be.
In which country does this Bundeskanzlerin actually live?
After its hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wurschtig and contents-poor, one must say: not here - not in the country, which would have to be finally governed by it.
Angela Merkel with a badly practice-substantial sentence rejected the reproach that she concentrates too much on the foreign policy.
That is provinziell, said it and showed with the fact only that she does not want to understand, for which the critics are.
In the Bundestag it documented for all recognizably, how very their reproach applies.
There neither concrete interest nor a feeling were to feel for the problems in the country.
Instead Angela presented itself cloud: a politician taken off, who flees into the foreign policy and remains even there in the approximate one.
Example climatic protection: There it praises itself without brakes for the resolutions of holy dam, says however not, how the in this country climatic goals are to be achieved.
At all, the self praise - so much immodesty would have malfunctioned itself the CDU boss still before two years.
Now it clasps itself to the empty phrase that the upswing arrives with humans.
Thus it damages its image as Pragmatikerin, which solves problems, instead of beautiful-talking the world.
But in the realm of Angela cloud problems relating to domestic affairs are an edge feature.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low breadwinners?
A few subordinate clauses has it for it remaining.
It is characteristic how often she promises herself, when it concerns the allowance for children.
Merkel needs three approaches there, in order to bring a halfway straight sentence out.
It stolpert as on strange terrain, if it becomes concrete.
Department of attack
In the Youtube debate of the republican presidency candidates the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and memo Romney a hard exchange supply themselves - and must be afraid now an outsider candidate.
The strain of the candidates unloads itself already with the first topic.
It made, accuses New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants" memo Romney for its contractor Rudy Giuliani.
This counters for his part with heavy reproaches: "I to say, its own house was a port for illegal ones", answers Giuliani and accuses to that former governor von Massachusetts privately immigrants without papers to have employed.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the republican basis has further no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all, in order to discredit their adversaries.
The turned 30-Sekunden-Videos, which sent InterNet users in via Youtube, is hardly more than reference givers.
"with this kind of isolationism we let Hitler come to power", accuse John McCain its contractor Ron Paul, who only demands as a departure from the Iraq, immediate in the round.
Also Romney gets of Viet Nam veterans strongly the Leviten read, when he refuses itself, who "Waterboarding so mentioned", a methodmethod method, with which drowning is simulated, condemning as torture.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign lie in the meantime however beyond from Iraq war and torture debates shows the reactions of the hall public in pc. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause breaks up in the auditory.
Shows up once more, where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I erred at that time", explain Romney zerknirscht and carry out before basis and television public for the fact apology that he belonged to 1994 still to the abortion proponents.
Giuliani however comes into the roll, when he is asked according to his opinion for the literal interpretation of the Bible.

The fathers herb skirt return
Of Germany super+'s group of the seventies makes music again: The three volume members of Harmonia again planned their consoles with a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival a Mitschnitt appears from their large time "Live one 1974".
They were substantially more famous abroad already at that time.
The fixed sensation occurs then in shape of three set gentlemen at the evening board.
Everyone has its small box before itself, its cables and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the bloom-white shirt with 63 years in the center.
Left flanks from Michael red ago, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.
Right, regarded from the auditory, Hans Joachim Roedelius, curves 73, concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, every now and then even a Beat.
And sometimes it adds itself inadvertently to a conventional piece of music.
That does not seem to disturb then also the gentlemen themselves largely.
The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again provided among herb skirt lovers for some excitement.
Whereby one may reveal here: Purposeful demands resulted in that the name did not schwirrte by the collective Popgedaechtnis, but by any means so lastingly, in order to miss this volume for 32 years painfully.
But why not also the German is to be allowed to celebrate its living legends from the seventies-years?
Particularly since what misleading herb skirt is called, was considered in England and America always more than in the own country.
When the music economy lent the survivor of the Cologne group of CAN 2003 the echo price for the life's work, one saw in the hall into asking German Popgesichter.
As also still talk yourself Hot Chili Peppers in the Laudatio with volume the La Duesseldorf and Neu! thanked you, knew the surprise no borders.
With concerts Michael squatted with talks red ago later Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old buddy.
The problem of the Ignoranz at home and the clarifying in the foreigner is one.
The memory is already overtaxed with Harmonia, because the Trio existed only two years and in this time also a far smaller effect power unfolded than them of others was later assigned.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music to many promising name cluster already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under that.
First one played in the cellar under the citizens of Berlin stagestage stage.
Afterwards in Duesseldorf, for economic reasons for a disk label maintained by the church.
With power station had helped out briefly red ago and itself afterwards as a guitarist with new!, the at that time perhaps most radical German group, a call erspielt.
Around 1973 followed red ago however the cluster musi edges in the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country.
There, in the old person Weser yard, a ruin from that 16. , they lived century as city-volatile Kommunarden.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius could have trouble still as child girls.
Rather in pointed-awayful artist existence.
Also a wimpel of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein was alleged and for the art a name in the check garbage.
Some held Harmonia of it.
The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and following "De Luxe".
Because so left and modestly the music also sounded, the volume suffered material emergency.
The brushwood collecting did not serve alone the self identification.
The CD "Live ones appeared now 1974" with a concert in Griessem, before one scarcely 50-koepfigen record background was along-cut, as someone believes to remember itself.
From red ago at that time the desire came to force and occasionally practice Harmonia.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The volume explained its separation to 1975.
Its existence landed red ago with albums like "flaming hearts" in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured themselves.
Since that time cluster was animated in the Achtzigern again and is more successful, than it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Groenemeyer.
Its disk company Greenland sat down it to the goal of maintaining the herb skirt as characteristic German contribution to the alive music.
Again! thereby like Roedelius solo work was already excavated.
The physical reon purchasing of Harmonia takes place in the citizen of Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Publicly, in the context of the festival Woldtronics subsidizes.
Julian Cope is there, the Britisher, Altpunk and author of the manual "herb skirt Sampler".
There also the Loveparade inventor is Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of the influences of the herb skirt on the following Popmusik would be outlined.
Thereby the blank character of the super+'s group is filled out by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall: "those only true music, it belongs the future."
There are pictures, which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmer room.
The putting formation projections of further black-and-white photos of confused verkabelten geraetschaften serve.
Before it are again with the improvisation concerned three veterans.
No more, by sticking microphones on the organ and on the schlagzeug, in order to draw from the instruments over tinkered effect devices outrageous tones.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical deepened Tueftler.
In it also the choir of the house does not change anything.
Under the line Barbara of morning star under sound clouds one coughs and one gewispert and in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaaah!" sung.
Herb skirt was always a very English term.
It never concerned skirt.
The roots were looked for less in the Blues, than in colleges of music (CAN), technologies (power station) or on the escape before artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Who here "' 68!" calls, has not completely wrongly, and Harmonia cannot be brought of it still from the peace.
Still the selfmost understandable is thoroughly considered on the stage.
Where does music catch on and when does it stop?
That can rob the nerves or give volatile moments of large luck.
Richard Gere is simply not zynisch enough
With "The Hunting party" and "Moerderi peace" are occupied again two films with the Balkans war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts set too much on Action and Geballer or however them are too agitate blessed.
There also Richard Gere in "The Hunting party" cannot help.
The good message first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide themselves still in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, now the actor Richard Gere was regained.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties-years last, because all too many nice-inconsequential roles in well-being feeling films for women and all too many press conferences drove the desire out on Hinsehen about Buddhismus.
Now is Richard Gere sudden the most important argument, itself "The Hunting party - if the hunter to the chase becomes" (why to have film titles today actually always as long and confused to be as engine driver collective agreements?) to regard perhaps nevertheless.
It supplies a marvelously augenzwinkernde representation: Strictly speaking its war reporter Simon Hunt is what from Gere could have become, if the fate and the filmbranche were not so benevolent: A man, who has its very best times for a long time behind itself, who retained its fall still considerable remainders of the former charm however even as ruin-same monument.
But despite this trumpfes "The Hunting party" sets the endless number of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of "Moerderi peace", which likewise starts in this week, only away.
With "Moerderi peace" one can make short process: The film acts of two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max of Riemelt), which saves a Serbin from kosovarischen snipers, on which the one promptly also still with her falls in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are here once not explained as exclusive root of all evil, the televisionflat film loses itself all too fast in Geballer and Action.
A kind "alarm for Cobra 11" remains without motorway however for it with war.
On the other hand can be investigated at "The Hunting party" almost exemplary, why it did not give actually ever a correctly good Balkans war film.
Perhaps the history of three US war reporters, who open themselves, in order to seek out the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox", could have become with another director and another film script author (both in personnel union Richard Shepard) to another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories resemble each other striking: Both marks go small teams into the forest, in order to achieve somewhat, what military to be able and both marks does not become it a journey into the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one does not let Simon Hunt be simple the heruntergekommenen cynic with heart, when who is presented he us at the beginning.
No, the Script must it in addition still another romantic affair with a late murdered Muslim Bosnierin andichten.
Finally "The Hunting party" does not go then the brook down, if within the last five minutes in the quick-motion apparatus procedure succeeds to the reporters, what NATO, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years creating: The war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosniern to the fair revenge left.
That is so bad that one would like to call the international Court of Justice into the Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human request.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic rumlaufen still freely, and it does not suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (here they are to be exeptionally times united) pursuit due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively.
But well the meaning and the bad are sometimes so similar itself that a famous breaking poem comes into the sense.
Therein it means over the holzmaske of an asiatic Daemons on the workbench of the poet: to "I see the swollen front veins suggesting Mitfuehlend,: like it is arduous, to be bad ".
Films like "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads, however suggest, like it are arduous to be good.
The problem is not limited to the category of the Balkans war film.
Recently it is in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films Hollywoods were large flops.
One can add: It did not give also ever a good South Africa film.
Nearly always applies: If a star on the crisis centres or mine fields of the world roams itself, then comes as thereby raus as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "the other world of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamond" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all the conflicts are temporally simply still too close.
Decades had nevertheless to offense, before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" could turn a good film over the Holocaust.
Some film will probably still mature - those as classical authors of valid Viet Nam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal jacket" were not celebrated at that time now by any means unanimously as masterpieces.
Perhaps but we know today, where each mass murder comes into real time on equivalent two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And the Bedenkenlosigkeit, which needs it, in order to tell good stories, robs from the film script writers.
"its or Nichtsein" or "the large dictator" became so good finally also, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet, how badly the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Perhaps one may not want to be good, if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps one must have the sarkastisch dissociated artist view of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.
When to parallels between its historical novel "Lemprières was asked the dictionaries" and the Balkans war, he answered: "it is only because of the fact that some things never change.
Large cities will be always terriblly dangerous, humans become in greyful way to be always murdered and to war in Yugoslavia will always prevail."
From Beust criticism for olympia refusal harvests
Moving of the mayor away from the application of Hamburg for olympic summer games is encountered with politics and economics violent criticism.
Many want to fight further for the plays at the water.
But of Beust realism reminds on during the estimate of the chances.
The managing director of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans Hans-Joerg Schmidt Trenz, called on Wednesday a renouncement "not well for the economic situation".
No other project unfolded as large motivation forces in the city in recent time as the olympia idea.
"without this goal the sport-political momentum could be maintained not equally."
Schmidt Trenz requested the senate not to bury the project but proceeds a new long-term beginning for it to find, "from a changed time jet".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements, according to which the olympia ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least up to the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on an olympia application, but the German olympic sport federation", said WORLD ON-LINE ONE of Beust.
It referred Decembers to for at the beginning of the resolution of the sport federation expected over an application of Munich for the winter plays 2018.
"this preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the period to 2028, angedachten so far by us."
The dream is expenditure-dreamed nevertheless not for all time, said of Beust.
That Hamburg sport federation (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
Thus the impression one arouse that Hamburg does not want to apply in the next 25 years no more for olympic plays.
"it is too early to block itself a chance by saying the plans already at this time buried", to HSB president Guenter Ploss on Wednesday.
A renouncement of the application contradicts besides for the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a receipt the plenary assembly of the general German university sport federation.
There from Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universiade did not designate 2015 "as replacement" for olympic plays in Hamburg.
The university sport federation had only nominated Hamburg in the past week as applicant city.
The SPD citizenry parliamentary group accused to the senate valuable time for housebuilding in Hamburg to have used.
"the development of the small Grasbrooks was for many years retarded by the senate, because it set the SPD delegates Carola Veit and January quast on the map Olympia and excluded, said housebuilding".
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use, the CDU set on one side on the "Event factor".
The application for the olympic summer games 2012 had caused a large enthusiasm at that time in Hamburg.
Hamburg had failed however because of Leipzig.
Those are not Warhols crates
Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not at Andy be-get.
Or nevertheless?
At present produced wooden boxes throw dark shade on Warhols list of works in Sweden.
A majority of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm", listed there, are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" geschuert some months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of the yearly 1968, internal investigations come now in the Moderna Museet into Stockholm to a ernuechternden result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former director of museum Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet 1995 as donation, are copies - and probably the majority that approximately hundred further Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm", which are on the international art market in circulation.
The prehistory is interlocked, a confusing concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
1964 created be-get in New York its first "Brillo Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white Design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of its work in the Moderna Museet 1968 issued - with Warhols agreement - hundreds of Brillo crates from pasteboard: These originated (from cost reasons) not from be-get, but directly from the Brillo Kartonagenfabrik were delivered.
It concerned not around works of art, but their models, around bare exhibits.
At the same time be-get 1968 have probably permission given for letting some few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden produce which were not issued however in the Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses speak now of approximately fifteen crates, which entered at that time as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes with the designation "type Stockholm" rightfully the art and auction history.
Some of them obtained than 100,000 dollar on auctions more.
The problem is now that the legendary director of museum Pontus Hultén falsely maintained later, it 1968 approximately hundred wooden boxes in Sweden was produced and issued, which be-get it then left.
Hulténs 105 crates only 1990 in Malmoe for an exhibition in pc. Petersburg were actually produced.
At this time were be-get already three years dead.
Lars Bystroem, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, examined three from Swedish private property beside the six museum-own Brillo Boxes also, by which two were made 1968 in Stockholm: Their laminated fiber plates were only primed and abgeschmirgelt, afterwards white oelfarbe with a brush was laid on.
The structure of the copies from the year against the fact 1990 betrays that the color with a painter role without priming was laid on directly on the laminated fiber plate - in addition it concerns not oil -, but around acryl color.
"these crates were authorized not by the artist and should be removed from the official list from Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes", mention the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve,: "if the ' Andy be-get kind Authentication board ' into New York to another conclusion does not come, the Moderna Museet the six crates in his collection than copy/exhibition material will classify."
Already in July the Authentication announced certainly board to follow to the "heavy accusations" which are raised in things of the soap powder crates.
But since that time one wraps oneself there into inexorable silence.
Revolting soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines revolting soldiers gave up, who in a hotel in Manila entrenchd and whom Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had demanded fall of president.

Government critics had called for Friday to large demonstrations against the president.
Their government is overshadowed for months by corruption reproaches.
Of Manila financial district was already 2003 main theater of the tried meuterei of approximately 200 military members against Arroyo.
The rebellion failed after scarcely 24 hours because of the refusal of the army to follow.
Since 1986 there were already at least seven Putschversuche against democratically selected governments on the Philippines.
