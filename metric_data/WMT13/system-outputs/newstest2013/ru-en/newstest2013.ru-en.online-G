The Republican strategy of resistance to the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify its policy of the need to fight against falsification of the elections.
However, in the Center of Brennan's consider the last myth, claiming that the cases of falsifications of the elections in the United States, more rare than deaths from lightning.
Besides, the lawyers of the Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense such actions partially discredited the American system of democracy.
Unlike Canada American States are responsible for organizing Federal elections in the United States.
That is why most of the state governments since 2009, to adopt laws, which complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has gained new momentum after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new places in 26 States.
As a result, only for one year 2011 was adopted 180 draft laws, which restrict the right to vote in 41 States.
New laws on elections require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, remove the right of registration of the voter in the day of the expression of will and take away the right to vote from the citizens, who have a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no one American state is not required voters to present photo identification.
Indiana became the first state, who made such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other States.
In the past two years, they initiated draft laws requiring voters to present photo identification, in 34 States.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity card, as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is 21 million people, have reached the age required for voting age, do not have an ID with a photograph, issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required identity cards often exceed one hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years old do not have the required identity document with a photograph.
But this is not all.
Students of voters, which are believed to vote for the candidates of the Democrats, in several States are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph, issued by their educational institution.
But these same States allow members of the fishing and hunting club, which vote mainly for the Republicans, used for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state is not required proof of citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting from 2011, more than ten States have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures is clearly designed to restrict the voting immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of the Latin American voters voted in favor of the Democratic party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, упраздняющие the registration of voters on the day of voting in eight States.
They have also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction were not without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped to make the lists of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken, starting from 2009, led to the fall by 17% of the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition Republican legislators have taken in the five other States of laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 General election, in Florida 33% of the voters, who voted ahead of schedule, were African-Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of the voters of the state.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of the voters, they accounted for 24% of the citizens, who voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike whites, who, forming 76% of voters, people who voted ahead of schedule was only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were ветировано governors of the Democrats.
The action of the most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the Prosecutor General of the United States.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 States have passed laws requiring their identity card with a photograph.
However, the new rules have entered into force, of course, hinder the implementation of the electoral law on the elections of 2012.
Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that have been passed, seeing in them a clear direction on what to influence the results of elections in 2012 in the key States.
Report of the centre Brennan from 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws are 171 out of 270 votes needed in the electoral College, to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence, that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense such actions partially discredited the American system of democracy.
Screening of prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the test for the DOG gives sometimes erroneous results, лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
Men, and so are reluctant to undergo medical examinations, we have something to doubt even more.
Take an HIV test or not?
We ask the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data are difficult to interpret, and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European found different levels of mortality for those patients, who underwent screening, and those who did not take place.
This study also found that after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis by 30-40% higher than in those who did not pass screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting from 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had cancer of the prostate.
Men of African-American origin are also at increased risk.
The key is making the right decision, as soon as the cancer is found.
The cancer may be as aggressive and indolent.
The patient needs to clarify the degree of the risk of cancer, offering him a possible options, without obligatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not dangerous for life in the long term, and making the choice in these cases, in favor of active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who have identified the cancer will not pass the course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to life.
We will they offer the active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we start the treatment.
Increasingly, we accuracy define the criteria for making a decision on who should or should not pass a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of urology, Мовембер created a tool to evaluate all the pros and cons of passing the test at the DOG.

Prevent illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is considered, that if all the people are great to eat and enough moved, 30% of cases Raco could have been prevented.
"If no one smoked, this figure would have risen to at least 50%", - stressed Andre Beaulieu, the press-Secretary of the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, an estimated 10% of cases of cancer is caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain a totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against Smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes tremendous harm to the health of the people.
"Even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers", - says the press-Secretary of Andre Beaulieu.
The encouraging fact: after 10 years after quitting your risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the data of the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of diseases.
They increase the risk of occurrence of a cancer of a mammary gland, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervix.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout the life protects against colon cancer", - added in the Association.
Power
The Association also recommends limiting the intake of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancers of the colon.
Should be avoided also sausages.
Preservation of meat by Smoking, drying or pickling, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"Last may cause harm to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", - explain in the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many of the scientists involved in the study of the influence of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies cannot be described as mixed.
According to the SCC, the study of vitamin E provide conflicting results.
If one of them showed decrease the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the influence on the development of cancer vitamin D also, there is no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and family history it is important to discuss with the doctor.
"Surrender of analysis does not lead to cancer.
The Higgs boson is in the details
Last summer a message that scientists might have been able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that the boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, neither more nor less.
In addition, this is the last particle, whose existence was predicted in the framework of the Standard model - our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter, but which had not previously been found empirically.
But physicists still not completely sure, that this is just about бозоне Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is really a new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson, predicted by the Standard model.
In addition, the new data presented at this week for a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, although to be sure, some of the data is still lacking.
Imagine all the same, that we are talking about бозоне Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem to be minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world one law is absolutely inevitable, says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule, there is no possibility, don't even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves.
But although the physics of elementary particles is rather a strange world, it turns out, that in it also there is a law of this nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that the two particles may not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in one and the same "quantum state" - is "condition" is, in General terms, some of their characteristics.
Proceeding from this, the share of physics of the particles in two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermions, which wisely obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, the bustling bosons, villainous gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
As informs a site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, of which we here will not speak, and "particle forces", by means of which are covered by the fundamental forces of nature and to which in some way concerns the Higgs boson.
Most of these bosons, it should be stressed that not all of these exotic creatures, as you would think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle that has an electric charge, is accelerated or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "violation" is born electromagnetic wave (light or infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is no more than a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons "vectors of force".
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, the only difference is that, in order to this boson appeared, should be "disturbed" another field, Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to arouse him, the need to reach a very high energies, as if it were on a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake just a big rock.
That's why need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that is operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful also for an explanation of the relationship between the Higgs boson and ground.
In fact, not all the particles and not all of the material interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, and others are not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not stick on the fridge.
Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have the mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) it does not have.
So, what "can bring" all of these studies, says Ms. Plamondon?
In science they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists find the discrepancy between the results of observations and forecasts CM.
In addition, some of them passionately crave to such a discrepancy is found, because the slightest discrepancy may open the door for "new physics" and plug some of the holes of the Model.
Last, you need to say, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (Oh!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the Universe (uh-Oh!).
But while at CERN of such differences was not found.
The consequences of
Benefit from the research to the daily life of the average person difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the beginning of 60-ies of the pioneers of laser research in the laboratories of the Bella could not even imagine, what kind of revolution triggered by their work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but not more than that.
In fact, already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Laboratories of the bell, which in 1960 was invented by a laser, and which itself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulse) in 1962, said that, initially, the laser was considered more as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for tools, accompanying the study.
For example, the same Уиллиард Boyle during their optical researches in 1969, has developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it wasn't his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the Nobel prize in physics 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Duty"
In the Commission for a worthy death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate will soon be resumed, and in this time of preparing the bill.
Nevertheless, in this crucial area, much still remains to be done.
"Debt" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Yet he lived alone in his apartment in Монтережи.
Cancer of the prostate, разрушавший it from the inside, gave him a respite for two years.
"They gave me five years, I have lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-Гадбуа in Whiter, where I arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, for it is impossible to prepare", - he says.
The disease does its job: the incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even feed themselves independently.
Sitting at the table, on which stands a delicious lunch, he gives in and agrees to be helped to take the food.
He braces, even manages to smile, talk to strangers, who are working around him, bring him medicine, and lead him into the bath.
Courage in the ordinary death.
"My greatest desire that cured me from diarrhoea, this is humiliating," - he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of life we are taught that a man must urinate standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the shelter Victor-Гадбуа.
Regress to the state of a child for some unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on a person's ability to" redress the decline, " he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people, involved in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enroll in palliative shelter Victor-Гадбуа, all of the sick with cancer.
Forecasts assign them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses did not provide more assistance, called "medical".
Ms. A., 89 years old, most of all afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation".
But the disease has allowed me to learn of their children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I I want nothing more in life," she says, before we allow to put her mask, facilitates breath.
She is still waiting in the next few days last visit his son, who had come from Italy.
In the shelter of the Victor-Гадбуа with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is palliative care, which is, when nothing more can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec in every 11 700 residents there is one place in the premises of palliative care.
This is very little, considering that sooner or later we're all going to die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martell - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it's the comfort of a physical, emotional or spiritual.
Dying we would agree to provide mouth-rinsing of brandy or Pepsi, it depends on what he asks for.
Diabetics we do not have to control the level of sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought the beer Mr. X., who died today at night.
On the morning of his son drank a beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We are helping to close, as well as patients," says Natalie saver, Director of the care of the sick.
In the shelter of the Victor-Гадбуа no day is like the previous one.
Close to the 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on his cushions during the toast in his honor, tragically dies young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and перепробоваший all, in order to survive.
"In the past six months of three to five beds, are always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," anxiously says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-Гадбуа, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians just don't have access to palliative care, that is, to care, which is provided to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-Гадбуа and Society of palliative care in the home of a Large Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively to the care of cancer patients.
This large gap in the health system Quebec makes many physicians - specialists in palliative care beware of the adoption of the law, легализирующего euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Starting from October circulates Manifesto, signed by the luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Балфуром Маунтом and Dr. Bernard Ляпуантом and witnesses about their disagreement with this initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system Quebec is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before it is allowed to transfer euthanasia.
Recently, " she says, " I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ensure that they facilitate.
I'm afraid that patients who wish to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hope for the survival of Helen Richard have already been minimal, when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she replied to me that he was sorry, that I stop fighting, " she says.
At that, she told herself, that my days are numbered!
The omnipotent care no
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, to thank the medical staff, because they have not fulfilled their request, after the team for palliative care eases their pain.
However it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, Director of palliative care in the Society of palliative care in the home of a Large Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8% of cases.
In the end-of-life doctors often resort to palliative sedation in which the patient sleeps up to the moment of his death, or from time to time or permanently.
It can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients, suffering from pain, always say one and the same phrase: "I want to die".
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you, I had euthanasia", it means "I want to make me feel better".
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to journalistic grant from the Institute of health research in Canada.
Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials, responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of funds of political parties and experts in the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the enormous "system", covering the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
"The industry", which is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious, how loose this system, after you have put into it all means, joking Jacques Дюшено, the Deputy and the former chief of police of Montreal".
Thanks to him, in 2011 the scandal erupted as a side result of the investigation of official crimes, connected with road-construction contracts in Quebec, in which the Prime Minister of that time from the liberals, Jean Charest, agreed reluctantly.
"Report of the Дюшено" made a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, the Ministry of transport would save billions of dollars in contracts," if some concealed his instincts to take part.
The Commission Шарбонно "already moved two mayors," he adds, hoping that she will be able to "open circuit, standing for individuals".
Permanent division on struggle against corruption created in 2011
To the case of connected created in 2011 Permanent unit for the fight against corruption, in which structure entered extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special division "Hammer", which after 2009 was forced to "drain the cartel" of Montreal, to stop the overestimation of the value of the contracts.
In recent weeks, was made a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the Franc Зампино and Richard Маркотту - the mayor of a small town, was charged with fraud and corruption.
In the queue - Gilles Вайянкур, a recently retired from the post of the mayor of Laval, the third biggest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of the repeated charges of accepting bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, formal charges were brought against several engineers service of transport of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Аккурсо and Lino Замбито.
The last blew up a real bomb, told the investigators about the "system" of receiving government contracts.
In several years Замбито gave 3% of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal, a mediator, connected with the mafia, which, in turn, translated the money of the party of the mayor of Жеральда Tremblay "joint Montreal".
In the 2000s Замбито wasted money right and left. He listed more than 88 000 canadian dollars (about 68 000 Euro) various parties of the province, mostly liberals, who was then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raising funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal party Natalie Нормандо.
Sewerage contracts, in which inflated the cost of
In Montreal "system" corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Сюрпренан, a former engineer for civil construction, in detail described her before the Commission: in the ten years he had received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, Golf tournaments, in restaurants, at the matches of the ice hockey and bribes to a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for sewage contracts, the value of which he inflated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that they received on the paw, overstating account for 30-40% with the help of false additions.
Then one organizer of the party of the mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay in the fact that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, filled the party coffers dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging the Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Руло was one of the first deputies in Montreal, beating the alarm.
The mayor of the district of Riviere-de-Прэри in the East of the island, it opposes in 2010, the sale of the municipal area, which was bought for $ 5 million and перепроданного for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be started, she "pull the string, which allows to understand the functioning of the system, patrolled by the ants, to stop gangrene and identify those responsible."
This process she характерезует as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but the Montreal will need its own investigation team and the observer, in order to avoid the return of dubious practices.
As we get out of the house.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Дюшено sees with his hand, that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but most especially it concerned the role of the "elected officials who knew about this scheme", but is not involved in the fraud.
Taking into account that the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec offers a limit of up to $ 100 donations to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "While we won't be strictly confined to election expenses in politics are dirty money".
It requires a complete rebuild of the system of state contracts and the financing of political parties: "We can't fall below; boldly penetrating into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a firmer Foundation, with better control and the rule of law".
If this story and casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Дюшено appeals to those, who laughs, look in your own backyard ...
"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you in Wolfsburg have made extraordinary proportions.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but can - and a new measurement of the PSG.
Profit of great players.
Next to them I'm growing every day.
Technical staff also brought so many things.
These factors are driving me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I don't распаляюсь.
From the very beginning in the center of preliminary training in the NIF in Клерфонтене and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always walked forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti...
Replenishment of the summer are not new to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that each training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that such a player, like me, eager to be on the level and posted to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning.
Help him such deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti - the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and it is included into number of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think, it will bring new titles Paris.
In January I had with him was encouraging conversation.
Then I moved away from a series of injuries.
Trust me he has also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season, PSG?
In the First League of Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main objectives is the UEFA Champions League: we effectively be classified in one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as you can.
From now on, all can be.
We can say his word face to face with a very good European teams.
First of all we want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, in order to be able to take a second match in the Octafinal.
Whether PSG be the first-class European club in the short term?
He had to do this already have a budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris necessary to win titles and consolidate its position in the long-term perspective.
Today this is not so.
Financially the PSG have the means to make this project real.
Not to take the title in the First League, as in the last season will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we have a real hot we wish to get the champion's title.
Last season we were close to this.
In may, was a disappointment, because we have everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We ended up with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be in order.
In spite of the fact that in the fight for the title entered such a strong team like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the power to win.
Don't You think that the mass media are waiting for too much from the PSG?
It is normal that we expect much, considering how much was invested and what we have players.
We are completely ready for it.
On the other hand, when we are at home win 4-0 against Trois and we still find for that attack, of course, it is a bit frustrating.
We ask ourselves the question, why in the first place expect from us the people.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We do not FC Barcelona!
We try to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League, that can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United FC, who is already two of the season cannot be one-eighth finals, although they, too, have spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amount, we you were 15 points ahead already the winter break.
It would disregard for our opponents and to the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which have not been at the height of last season, had been "awakened" this new PSG.
This shows how interesting the First League.
I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say to himself that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we have won.
PSG, it seems, depends entirely on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, and what if they say that there is a "Златанозависимость".
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to do this, and he proves that he's the star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star of world scale.
In the group we are his respect as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done, it is really only.
It stimulates and other improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you have experienced the Euro-2012 with the national team of France?
As a disappointment.
I wished to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab a bit of playing time.
I have seen a lot of things, and I came out stronger.
Today I managed to play a good qualifying matches .
This is something that I was hoping since my baptism of the Blue.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must act in an exemplary manner.
What do You think about the first months of Didier Дешама in Chapter Blue?
They are effective.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the world Cup.
He strict coach, it is close to the players and inspiration to victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he described us in Euros.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will cause the Blue in Brazil.
Good deserved a draw (1-1), torn October 16 in Spain - it's a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in yourself.
Each fought for all.
To this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.
Pay and sell without the help of banks with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current money exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between the receiving party c fees for processing them.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, it is obvious political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Накамото (pseudonym), simultaneously is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, Euro ...) and secure communication Protocol according to the type of BitTorrent, which makes it possible to exchange files between members of the same level.
About 200 000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousands of web sites take биткойны for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
Course биткойна, peaking at $ 30 (23 euros) in June, 2011. five months later fell to $ 2, before returning today to about ten dollars (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on a virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the Euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies as the "loans" are used for the promotion of in a video game, which is earned in the game process or of which it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchanged).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always monitors and handles any Central authority.
In Биткойн all nodes of the network at the same time are holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers of currency, покупателыми and sellers.
The functioning of this network?
Each transaction between two users really going on between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for every new payment the user can select a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to the transaction, shall be signed electronically, using the encryption system with double-key.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Due to the content of a file, you can verify that the биткойны used in a transaction, there are indeed in the public accounting book, sent across the network.
The key step is the registration of the new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem, a kind of computers, decided that, if the temporary Central Bank has the privilege to add the new line.
It is about the phase of the hash file, then there is a conversion of a large file in a digital signature short and unique.
Computers "take the" a new transaction and add her number before the "hashed" all together.
The goal is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easy to check that it is correct.
The transaction are thus нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification of a change digital signature.
If for the purpose of deceiving the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) would have to pay two times by one and the topic of same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would have remained unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer has decided to task gets 50 биткойнов.
To avoid inflation, the award regularly divided into two halves, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of биткойнов in circulation, therefore, is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one стомиллионной, which leaves a reserve of...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has survived the UPS and downs.
Web sites, service providers Will have been subjected to attack, and биткойны were stolen from the reserves.
"Using the defect is not to the Protocol," said Pierre Нуаза, which recently launched a Paymium - the company which is carrying out the payments real money with the use of Bitcoin network.
The ECB has also informed about the possibility of money laundering through this that anonymous service.
But cash money also have this disadvantage.
Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Still others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their permit.
Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, reviewed the books of account and found that almost 80% of биткойнов are in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Холмквист, working in Coinabul, which is involved in the conversion of биткойнов in gold.
Pierre Нуаза, the other is the author of manuals on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify the transaction, which thus comes out cheaper.
The owner of better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, who do not need to install a new device or software.
It is enough just to inform address, which can be "photograph and recognize" the telephone, said Pierre Нуаза, assuring that he has already thousands of users.
There is a General trend revision of hierarchical systems in favour of a more horizontal.
"First of what Will be established, it will take some time, but the year 2013 can be a turning point", - he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to revise a variety of risks that are considered today increased, in case of success of this system.
We had left Afghanistan.
What next?
The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Суроби).
NATO and the Americans have to follow them to the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army now is the time to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their own future, not relying only on us.
From the us suffered mainly Afghan peasants, which we considered as terrorists .
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders who are hiding in Pakistan, but also often from the peasants, who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, the old and archaic, even to join them jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They suffer, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will be no more, as soon as the West will behave in a more delicately.
Withdrawal of French troops from the base Ниджраб, which I watched from the height of the hills planted with almond trees by the French loans, passed in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, not being атакованными.
With the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not .
Circumstances have changed since the time of their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time of Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of release, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for obscurantism of the peasants, where they exceeded al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and in our days.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban United in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war, returned to power in 2001.
They have become the dealers, capturing the state of the earth, to resell them for construction of the repatriates, who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using the huge American subcontracting contracts.
They discredited; the majority of them, by the way, even were not at war.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, want the government, which would consist not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, how to make those who managed to American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and of its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities filled, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who do not wish to return or to the obscurantism of the old parties, nor the corruption of a few leaders.
All, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and that look everywhere.
Currently the army is.
The authorities, who will be in charge, will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, had anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures for the restoration of the provincial armed forces who would not obey the Central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, must be to a certain extent decentralised, on the model of Western countries, but the United States would like to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which existed from the times of the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want to foreign control, in particular before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting with the 50-ies, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
Industry was not brought to his feet, none of the dam is not functioning, none of the irrigation system is not repaired.
All imported; produces nothing, but vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by the thirty years war, the state control over the infrastructure would be required.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to possess them.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transport to their export through the mountains, there is no production of mineral resources.
The Chinese have already almost gone copper field of Months Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the world Bank) to dig out a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that one day in the same way Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on the import and export, restore normal relations.
Conclusion French military units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of the traditional aid: Lyceum for girls, for boys, faculty of French language at the University, the French Institute, the cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support of the delegation.
In 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and perform the impossible task of combining assistance in offensive operations, the service "civil-military activities" under the Ministry of defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, could help to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, rehabilitation of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of the area of arable land.
What will we leave to the memory of himself, after spending two billion euros in military spending?
Much more modest budget helped to improve the living conditions of the local population, very severe in the valleys, often located at a height of more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small agricultural works, outgoing from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of uprising, led by foreign groups, which want to farmers, as they told me, you need to provide them with a small, non-military support, which would be well controlled and would have done to him directly.
Heavy labor of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step of the President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the question of constitutional Declaration, which temporarily give him emergency powers, he decided to play VA-Bank.
Catching everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly a week ago the head of state gave an Assembly of two additional months to finish the job.
Soon the two years, as Egypt is based on the draft text, which has been amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "disturb the word" and "shall tread down the right".
In the camp of his followers sure that this is the way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum shall be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain the Egyptians text, article after article.
For the President it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Морси, seems convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he stated in an interview to the American weekly Time.
The more that call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave himself emergency powers", which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional Declaration, they slammed the door, feeling not in a position to convey his opinions.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
To the quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Brothers of Moslems.
It is not surprising that in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few differences day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the Committee considered that the clock of the Constituent Assembly has not been properly configured.
The text, according to which only yesterday was a vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of everyone's attention, article 2 of the ultimately remained identical to the article of the Constitution of 1971, which States that "the principles of the Sharia is the main source of law".
Салафистские party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the major requirements hoped to replace the "principles" of the "rules"that would allow them more strict application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed, is an indication of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" - with the liberals who see this as the only PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar Advisory role, in particular as regards verification of conformity of laws of the Sharia.
According to a specialist in Egypt Sophie Помье, this is alarming because the "people, called to make decisions, not elected, and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe the birth of a theocracy".
Many liberals, in addition, get excited fact that the next rector of the University, it seems, will be far less reasonable than the current.
"At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, " this is not the ' ulama and the people with University education, some were trained in the French system" - calms Alexis Блое, which prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around article 220 can be ambiguous, as used in it terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, - Prim ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as far as civilian judges are competent to make decisions about it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticised, because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers ' claim that they were considerably reduced in comparison with those which were under the old regime.
Another moot point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will take place not in the Parliament, and the National Council of defence.
Also would not be prohibited trial of civilians in military courts, in spite of the request of associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider harmful to freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now banned insult, which can have serious implications for the freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles does not speak about the protection of women, stresses Heba Мораеф, of human rights watch.
According to her, the only positive aspect is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word, which does not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was to speak last night on television, demonstrations are planned in the second half of the day.
The supporters of the head of state, in its turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel of Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the Holy places, the Navel of the Earth and the sea from the brine
The Promised land combines the grandeur of the truth of the Bible, modern comfort and the fine nature.

Carefully renovated theater is now used for evening concerts and Opera performances.
A tourist on a note
Going to Israel, don't worry about my imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population knows Russian language.
The money for the trip better not take in the Euro and the dollar, which can be easily translated into new Israeli shekels (now us $ 1 a day. - 3,8 NIS).
Urban transport, mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa - the only in the country subway line, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower town from the Top.

"Great and mighty" to Moscow will bring: migrants hoard money into the language of
While deputies and human rights activists argue that give the law on compulsory language test in the country have already appeared crooks selling "phony" certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come 13 million guest workers.
The greater part of the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose is to earn money to support families back home.
From December 1 the law came into force, according to which each migrant worker will be obliged to pass examination for knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and utilities economy, life and retail trade.
However, with time, - promise in the FMS, the tests will be obligatory for all visitors.
Moreover, take the necessary not only to language but also Russian history, and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to receive, and for the extension of the work permit.
An exception only applies to the citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
Do not fall under action of the law and the people, who managed to certificates and diplomas to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, the sense of doom and protection of the rights of
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language named after Pushkin, the peoples ' friendship University, Moscow state University, St. Petersburg state University and other Russian universities.
Pass the tests migrants can in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centres.
Initiative on introduction of testing was supported by the deputies of the state Duma, and the Federal migration service.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask in a press question: what is, in fact, give us?
What changes will be bound by the knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all, meet the representatives of the migration service, - it will reduce the number of people suffering from the "labour servitude".
Very many people now talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Себелев.
The protection of their rights should begin prior to their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow to 90% solve the problem of foreign workers.
The problem arises among migrant workers no profession, education, not knowing the language, do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, " I'm sure Себелев - the next migrant doomed to deal with unscrupulous people, who under the guise of assistance thrust is complete his "ticket" in a cramped barracks where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, and hammer for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one thing, but on arrival they are deceived, passports confiscated, do not pay the promised salary", - confirms the head of the Main division of labour migration MS Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear, насяльника!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, come to work in Russia, recognized that not only do not know the language of the country in which aspire to, but also on their own-then write with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, how much trouble a few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a smart primary education.
Because their families have nothing to even feed the children, not to mention the fact that decent their dress, shoes and equip the school.
To grow up to teenage age, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.
It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, " they say.
"Feel humbled and deeply flawed."
However, in regard to the act on the language of human rights defenders note one important moment.
Testing will be carried out only to those migrants who have legal status.
If the status is not - there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or no trespassing"
Many of them claim that receive the official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is that the bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization of the costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
And that's a false registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
Staff members of the Russian police know that we have basically false documents, no registration, hence, cases of extortion.
"Asking a hundred, two hundred cigarettes, tea", - has shared with journalists the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Хушкадамов.
"Fly, don't be miserly, buy paintings"
In the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it turned out that false are not only migrant documents for registration.
Several "bogus" certificates about passing the language test has already seized by the FMS.
Fake paper printed on normal color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not free: each of migrants who are thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
It in two with superfluous time more expensive procedures of official testing: it will cost migrant workers in three thousand.
In fact, that the main task for the nearest future is to protect the system against corruption, in order to "peel" it was impossible to simply buy converge and representatives of the authorities and human rights activists.
Meanwhile, the authorities can promise guest workers, not been able to successfully pass a test the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian, you will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
Ministry of internal Affairs does not take in the turnover of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
Ministry of internal Affairs of Russia suggests to toughen the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and massacre, a Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the Press killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of the травматики in public places and raise the age at which you can receive the license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea has supported the head of the Duma Committee on security and countering of corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will contribute to the state Duma in the near future.
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by means of a "crackdown".
In the network of the open letter was published, the authors of which, representatives of different public rifle organizations require to abandon a "senseless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapons minimal, said the Russian service Bi-bi-si lawyer forensic Vasily Foresters.
According to the statistics Ministry, over the six months of the year 2012 is committed 142 crimes involving firearms, registered in the bodies of internal Affairs, while the total for the same period was recorded 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter sure that the tightening of legislation in the sphere of civil weapons does not place the perpetrator to go on the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of interior state that controls the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to the officers of
The "black" market of weapons is replenished through several channels.
These major channel five, says a retired Colonel Viktor Баранец, ten years worked in the structure of the Ministry of education and the General staff.
A screenshot of a website that receives the orders for weapons
The first - "army or military footprint", i.e. weapons, which had been stolen during the hostilities in the Caucasus.
"The arms and dragged the Russian officers, and the Caucasians", - says Баранец.
The next type of "black weapons" - stolen criminals from representatives of power structures.
Баранец explains that this includes gone with the police warehouses, and stolen directly to law enforcement bodies.
Illegal "trunks" go on sale from military warehouses.
For many military warehouses often occasional explosions.
"There is proved the version of that part of the arsons have been made specifically to cover the shortage," says former military.
Their contribution, according to Баранца, make weapons manufacturers.
"Now breed private arms factories, which are not competitive on the international market and throw away the weapon from under the floor on the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of "black" market - smuggling.
Especially a lot of acts of pistols and machine guns from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is own production, sometimes Handicrafts, and formed a mob, which organised the stream", " explains the former military.
Where the weapons?
Experts considered, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
The report of that in 2011 the Center for problem analysis and state-administrative planning.
Specialists analysed the statements of the Ministry of internal Affairs and Federal state statistic service, criminological literature and open data portals on weapons issues.
The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapons, write the researchers, comes from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market out there "through the fault of the officials, whose work is connected with the weapon," the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of the cases the weapon comes from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur theft at the stage of the production of nuclear weapons, 5% goes to the "black archeology".
Seller-consultant of one of gun shops, who asked not to name him, assures, that the weapon was found black diggers, already long ago no one buys - too old.
Most often, as he says, the new party sellers go on a military warehouse.
Through the ensign's a person buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
He discharged it, pass through the fence.
"He carries her to the city and here sell for 900 euros each with two shops", - he says
"However, the police in the course of all cases, therefore periodically when the lamp is lit plan for the detection of crimes, conducts the test purchase from merchants illegal weapons," says the consultant.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through friends.
I looked on web sites, blogs, so far not responded friend, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya", where will be the man who would take me in a "corner", where we will be traded.
The price of the barrel I only found out there
military commentator Viktor Баранец
To get the trunk I need a friend, who is a way out, " says the seller-consultant. "I have a friend there, but I'm in it I am not sure.
Sellers at the markets there are, but there, too, you need to come, say, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell, that the daughter of a tooth fell out of it".
I now even a couple of knuckles get through a man in whom I am sure.
He also their supplies only me, because he knows that I did not rent.
Newcomers searching for weapons of different ways.
A former military Victor Баранец tried himself in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about this.
The scheme, according to him, has not changed.
He was given an album with the photos, where it was "anything goes".
"I feel like in a luxurious shop", - says the military.
The buyer, according to Баранца, do not offer a cat in a bag " all you can try.
I, a potential client, not just buy a " we're going with the seller in the forest, where we put the target.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapons beats well, begin to bargain", - describes the procedure for the expert.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet lead to the sites and the group in the "Vkontakte", where the offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
It does not require any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", - write in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a gun battle or vending machine".
The it users leave your requests and questions.
A minor sold?
"Without a license, of course", - asks the user "John" (spelling preserved).
"Buy ТТ.Москва" - concise formulates a query "Федоренков".
The Federal security service is now разбросила a huge network of fake web sites and want to buy weapons rows with a shovel.
People go, like a fish on a прикормку, and then mined in Siberia coal
military commentator and former military Victor Баранец
I have heard of such schemes: usually the website is registered outside the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through the ATM / cash machine pays.
"In response, send a photo and a step where the hidden weapon", - says the press-Secretary of the public organization "Law on weapon" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Баранец claims that leaving the application form on the site, you can go without weapons and go to jail.
The Federal security service is now разбросила a huge network of fake web sites and want to buy weapons rows with a shovel.
"People go, like a fish on a прикормку, and then mined in Siberia-coal", - he says.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal small arms, according to estimates of experts, we can meet in the amount of from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Law on weapon", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Will have to wait a month and a half.
He is shipped from warehouses of long term storage of the leadership of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official стастистике agencies, in comparison with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%.
In the United States are on strike the workers of fast food and supermarket chains
Through the work on the vault of the "McDonald's" is held up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in the Department stores Corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger king, Taco bell, "Уэндис" and "Kentucky fried chicken".
While no one can predict, will become whether this surge in the ninth shaft or she is destined to become stale in the early stages.
Shares of support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to enhancing the modest salaries, which are ordinary workers Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the establishment of trade Union organizations.
While this sector of the economy almost does not participate in the trade Union movement.
46 cents in the year?
The shares began last week, after a Day of thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday"when America fell Orgy cheap sales, has captured millions of the inhabitants, and sometimes accompanied by scuffles.
On this day, some of the employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which worldwide employs 2.2 million people left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and moderate means.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from the cradle, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores to increase from 8% to 27% is cheaper, than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage workers Walmart merchandised only in his work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations of America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods podeshevke partly because little pays out to its employees.
They also complain about the difficult conditions of work, for example, to a lack of forklift truck or hand-held scanners.
Participants of the shares in "Black Friday" demanded to increase the wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance, provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical worker Walmart, the receiving of 9.5 per hour, this expense can not afford it, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart increase среднуюю pay up to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the Corporation to 3.2 billion dollars.
It is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on a salary now.
If Walmart entire shift the growth of salaries on the shoulders of the buyers, that each visit to the store will cost them a total of 46 cents more expensive.
During the year they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more, than now.
Supporters of Walmart rather say that the protests have taken place only in nine States and are not caused Corporation or малейщего damage.
"Black Friday" was continued in its stores from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time, Walmart had sold about 5,000 products in the second.
In the total of the cash registers produced in a "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the Corporation Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview to the left of the site the Huffington Post that the jobs left in the total of "less than five employees Walmart, and that the action of protest was just "another пиаровским trick" which organized the trade Union.
"Free cash!
Protests continued this week in new York, where their targets were not Department stores Walmart (they are, in the progressive city do not favor, and so they here yet), and "Макдоналдсы" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even gives you the hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!
Джумейн Williams, a member of the city Council of new York
At the moment the minimum wage, according to the Federal and new York law, is 7.25 x dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants with the time of its increase, but only slightly, and in the middle of their rank and file of the workers receive in new York 8,90 dollars an hour.
Less of them in this expensive city does not make one.
How can exist in new York on such money, for me it's incomprehensible.
Once through "Макдоналдсы" was held nearly a quarter of American teenagers, who had been working for their stalls after school, living with the parents.
Few who saw in it the main source of subsistence or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly have come across in the interview with the workers of the "Макдоналдсов"who complain that should live on the salary and sometimes even feed on her children.
On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal hanging comment, the author which says that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, what will you feed them.
Participants of the protest, which began at 6 : 30 in the morning on Thursday in "McDonald's" on the 40 th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast food systems have begun to pay at least $ 15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that in the field of fast-food outlets have been established trade Union organizations.
U.S. law prohibits the administration of this discourage and punish activists of the trade Union movement harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely it easier for them to life.
But cover the trade Union of fast food is difficult to objective reasons.
One of the major extraordinary fluidity of the personnel.
Discordant
Noisy protests were held on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the shares was in the middle of the day rally at McDonald's next to times square, on which were several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the city Council Джумейн Williams, who said: "McDonald's", says that he is selling billions of servings, and after that he didn't even gives you the hospital and does not pay you for the honest work!".
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent new York Democrats, for example, a candidate to the post of the city mayor bill De Бласио, who said that "we must join together in support of workers of fast food, so they have made fair remuneration and economic well-being, which deserves every new йоркец!".
As described what happened the New York Times, it was the largest action of such kind in the history of the U.S. sphere of fast food.
But it was participated in by only several hundreds of people, though not all of them were workers of fast food service, which in new York employs tens of thousands of people.
It is still unclear whether this will generate the spark of the flame of a mass movement.
"While fooling the brain turns out medium"
Popular among the fans of modern technologies theme of augmented reality in the last time are taken mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First summer at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the patent was filed and Microsoft.
However, from the conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D-technologies in Кэмбриджской laboratory Microsoft Шарамом Изади therefore, for the scientists of the company glasses - phase.
Drawn in by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
- Tell us, please, in General terms, what does your research group?
"We are in the human interaction with machines, but while trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as humanity in the mass stuck at the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the choice finger at them.
We also want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict dramatic changes in the way of interaction.
For example, the prefix Xbox and sensors Kinect is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today without Kinect is not sold, it is interesting to жестовое management.
- What still awaits us in the future?
- In spite of the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction on a physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Entering information improved system receives more data), but the conclusion is not very.
We try to change it, working on a truly three-dimensional display systems on the basis of different technologies, including projective.
To release the computer world in our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to complement the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid helmets of a virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular thing, but not overestimate do it?
- It should definitely not be considered as panacea - the question arises of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we have thought about gestures, but not above the sweeping, and over such meager, short.
The gestures were not the camera in your device, and wrist bracelet, which recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
Until he is big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in General, the future for the mixed type of control, for example, a gesture+voice.
"Is that so?
- For example, as you ask me to tell you that can of soda?
You say and at the same time show.
- I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
"So you want to force users to adapt to something that may or may not at the moment, the car?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think, in the near future, we mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which allow a better identification of the person's response.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect, what you have claims to modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation - is something you can build in our work above three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would get 8 megapixels with the speed of 1000 fps.
But the matter is not in the мегапикселях, and as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view all the current technologies for we are not good enough - it adds to the work of designers algorithms.
It is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the axes X and Y, and Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 to/with the frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Бетишес of our Рэдмондской laboratory did sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - from 1 up to 100 MS, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone is aware of how it affects the interaction between man and machines.
I would in my work is very useful to the equivalent of such a device, not demanding touches to frames per second was more.
"And increase the number of cameras don't need to?
- In the Kinect now have three "camera", one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of reflected signal.
And now a third camera - this is, in fact, normal sensor of the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially increasing the number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or aggravate it, increasing the amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect, play around with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how this will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, is not presented to the public his glasses.
Don't you think that from the point of view of everyday use of technology of augmented reality glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the while of walking, holding smartphone in the raised hands, not very comfortable, but that's what I think: the coolest option would be a "turning" augmented reality, when on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch from glasses to your smartphone, projection display and further everywhere.
Points - a very personal device, that is their power (private things you see only you), and at the same time the weakness of - augmented reality on the basis of the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony stark from "Iron Man", but also an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that often indicate the critics of this idea: there is no tactile review!
The hands don't feel anything!
What kind of answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
In his lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh in a row breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think, the eighth may very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - using second hand as a substrate for the image.
She is an excellent registers pressing!
But there are technologies that are really intended to provide that "the pictures in the air" осязаемости - for example, the interference of several aimed ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where is the finger, gives a feeling, but it is very weak, as if you blew on the pads.
There are bracelets on her wrists that affect the nerves in the fingers and toes and is a promising direction.
"And you tried to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels that like to feel in the moment when he sees something?
- Now it is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.
Here lies another challenge that will beat for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is going to open, practically infinite - are working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not such, as in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While fooling the brain turns out medium, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work with the virtual reality as attractive for the researcher - many things absolutely in its infancy.
Вкусовщина instead of culture - Росбалт.ру
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the residents of the city, which are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
In the top-list of already caught the bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are outside the scope of the city, often finding acclaim in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero Rosbalt - flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller - bearded man, dressed in all red, which is the Russian Museum, the Summer garden, the fashionable hangouts and opening day.
Pictures Kirill Miller always gather a crowd of spectators, where they had not exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the sensitive St. Petersburg social-philosophical storytellers, the creators of the new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright person St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's-early 90-ies.
In addition, he is a man of the city, its appearance on the streets of calling a smile from townspeople, lifts the mood.
He recently in hands took the hurdy-gurdy and became the St. Petersburg шарманщиком, as ripe for this challenging role of all its Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all of red, and not in a yellow or turquoise, for example?
"I chose the color red as a fashion designer, specializing in the appearance and image.
In this world the color red is a compromise between the artist, имиджмейкером and society.
Although the society is that a little bit of grey, causes aggression and agitation unkind properties.
But my provocation directed to the conversation started.
The whole history of my acts of provocation - an invitation to discussion.
"And when did you understand that you should be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Palace of Nevsky Prospekt, where they were exhibited my work.
I realized that this was my path.
Then a wave of old free of the unofficial artists was held, and the new, free like me were not understood.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the "Pushkinskaya-10", and more waves was not.
I'm in theatre, clothing, music in all genres, but the word.
- And all this combined in your Art-clinic... - it was important for Me to find yourself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took the territory of the Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until it was repaired, there was a musical-artistic club, Bohemian club, home of the St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: the Nomes, Tequila-jazz, I remember, as the Cord is brought with the project "the Ear of van Gogh".
Cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in a skintight leotard, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started to play live, it was "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the leading many programs to Hali-галивских times.
We gave them Трахтенберга, and went to his great career, and a basic education and training he has received.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov " this echoes from the Art clinic.
There our employees and patrons of the left.
I was a hero of yesterday century, when a culture is something meant.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the year" was named, I ended my climax.
In the new times on the old rules uncomfortable work, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years of easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is inherent in a recognizable manner.
"Many of my picture - it's hits, they pronounced the relevance and acuteness.
I will program the exhibition, "the Russian Museum in клоунах".
The clowns - timeless category.
I used the social was, is now to be such a pain and fear.
But in клоунах all smeared, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian changing of clothes in the form of an order.
Now the clothes are met, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand submit and you can't spit in the face should be.
And deception will be removed with the help of changing.
"But recently we saw you in the role of an urban an organ-grinder's. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, them to be.
"Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art should be careful, considerate, sweet.
Is disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people congregated in the pack, La Boheme one loved, suckers another.
Now all the broken in микросообщества, now it's hard to enjoy it all.
I don't стодолларовая a piece of paper to please everyone.
Now we need to think about who will like it.
Now everyone has a cult hero at 100 fans.
"And the Stas Mikhailov comes in several thousand!
- It comes broshenki, there сексо-social sphere is activated.
And on the cultural soil 300 people come, and 10 thousand't come, and as a result less of management, money, everything falters.
I have fans, the main thing - they do not cheat, do not spoil the property.
As a girl I wrote these paintings, which have a collector of them on the wall beside Falk and Larionov hung.
I started with paintings, which generally end up.
Now often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of the consumption, this is from another Opera.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I'm for a culture.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from the culture.
But not each of them may engage in the culture.
If all the kings of all was not so, the kings, perhaps, not quite understand the culture, but they understood that to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now, good consultants.
We have in St. Petersburg there are people who might be experts, but they pushed, so the higher the experts, who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the road.
Now thrives вкусовщинка.
The same Эрарта, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept that there is such artists, which should look for other museums.
"What is it to you - Petersburg?
Petersburg is a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is more, the soil is.
But on our rocks art grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, this is wrong.
Here in Europe a lot of people любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer is thin.
We need to make the fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented under the grant of Saint-Petersburg
Bear in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid-killer.
The caravans of the spacecraft with the humans on Board are sent to find a spare planet.
To save mankind, raises the main question of how to continue the race in the conditions of weightlessness, or on the same spare the planet?
I think that little choice.
In fact these planets only two that you can learn at least hypothetically.
"That's of Venus and Mars", - says a senior researcher of the State astronomical Institute named after P.K.. Sternberg (SAI) Vladimir Surdin.
But if on Mars conditions more suitable for life, the surface of Venus - the temperature of 500 degrees.
One can live only at high altitude or at the orbit of Venus... in space.
To treat matters of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago have conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations grown in orbit peas did not differ from their earthly varieties.
Then launch to orbit insects, tiny fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, in the space sent quail eggs, to check how the embryo develops in the conditions of weightlessness.
We get the output of absolutely normal babies.
And then starts the problem.
"The problem related to the fact that this chick must find a support, he must stand up on your feet and start moving," explains head of laboratory of the Institute of medico-biological problems (IMBP), Vladimir Sychev.
Not finding support, Chicks randomly tumbled.
After 10 hours in the newborn was complete atrophy of the instincts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there's trouble was that in four days they simply perished.
"And twice we вылупляли Chicks, after it refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them", - noted the failure of the experiment with Chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With the animals of the last time the biological "миниковчег" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, the биоспутнике "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats, which were to be sent into space already with the fruit.
In principle, there is nothing supernatural.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - this is an isolated experiment, and such studies should be carried out", - says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing from space rats appeared offspring.
But to come to the problem of reproduction directly in space is not here yet.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, familiar environment, simply could not realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike the animals, in principle, may.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and in a position to create an emotional background.
For ethical reasons, these experiments not carried out.
But a woman in space flying for almost 50 years.
The greatest risk was the Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing there is in mankind, - this woman's body.
Our gull flew away, and no one on Earth could say: will it after the flight into space.
Could she give birth to a child after this flight.
"For to this question is no one answer," says a veteran of the space-rocket industry Vakhtang Вачнадзе.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Андриян Nikolaev also was an astronaut.
In 1988, the first woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice traveled on the orbit and even поработавшей in the open space, was born a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, a few, there are astronauts, who after long-haul flights, the cost and growing a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even if the orbital flights", - sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, mankind should look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
Гидролаборатория CTC is an obligatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts work on their skills to work in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults water, let and comfortable, but still alien environment, the baby - native element.
Small ихтиандры if confirmed - life on the land went out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months my mother in окоплодной fluid, it is easier to get used then to a little water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, is only 2 weeks.
"This is very little, to be forgotten", - says the instructor грудничкового sailing Marina Alekseeva.
In a word, if to a child who is born weightlessness a more natural state, for women - is required of gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness senile muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls ability to expel the fetus.
Well, okay, scratch and this, relying on the stimulators of labor activity.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go to give birth, she pulls him.
"And then what?" - specifies a non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need the artificial gravity.
Not feeling the gravity of the earth, the body does not form a skeleton and muscular system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, dressed in a special pull-up suit for training.
It would just be deprived of what he would be vital.
"And this experiment, in which we are with you come on, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to the Ground of the disabled person, fully дезадаптированного man," - foresees the head of the Committee on bioethics of IBMP RAS Igor Lunev.
Until the birth of children in outer space is a question of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when the humans in their boats go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main control and revision office: Check the Schwarz-system has failed through the fault of the politicians.
In the sector of public procurement Czech Republic has good control authorities and, in spite of the presence of high-quality legislation is lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme audit office, from an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will not be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough",- commented on the current situation of feces.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities.
As an example of improper practices cause the approach of Peter Нечаса to the so-called Schwartz-system.
The Prime Minister has recently said that the ODS (Civic democratic party) would not bother employers ' checks - out is prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be in any way established, and, if that's what he forbids, and the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are obliged to verify and enforce the obligations",- States the feces.
At the meeting of the audit Committee in the Chamber of deputies of you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties, in the framework of which was mapped legislation on public procurement of both countries.
About what there was a speech?
We have in mind a parallel test, which we started, I guess, two years ago.
Simply put, we talk about the fact that the European legislation approves, how to pass the state purchases, followed by the national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All information has been collected and, even in the still unfinished verification, revealed interesting differences " to put it simply, our laws can be "accurate and error-free", but in practice we use in some respects inferior to Germany.
From this it follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
And actually as this project can help you, what he means to you?
It is a joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduction and improved restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy of means appropriate things for a reasonable (but not always low) price, to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behaviour.
But not the fact that we will achieve this goal, lowering of the limit orders.
It is possible that this system full of "securities" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them much easier, than if the restriction is not decreased.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
And the functioning of the control system in Germany?
There is there an organization such as our KRU (audit office) or is this different?
As regards institutions, there in the quality of our KRU is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle, there is also the College, working a little differently, but in General both institutions operate in the same way.
Additionally, the powers to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a Federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of Federal States - in this case, their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage Federal money, we dispose of public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal audit chambers.
With regard to local legislation, it is easier, than we have?
In General, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some ways Germany can be taken as a sample, but you can't definitely say that she is the best of all.
This is so because they are better able to cope with the control?
Definitely not, but again, I such comparisons do not like.
But I must say that even exemplary countries are faced with many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right?
If to speak about the domestic law, as reflected in your facility amendments to the Law on public procurement, somehow manifest consequences?
Taking into account that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it still is not apparent in our work to control.
As we carry out the control on the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
Taking this into account only in the process of preparation of the future checks - we started to use our new tool "detection risk неэкономности", through which we drove almost 14000 of state contracts. We have them analyzed. There is, of course, these changes will occur, because changing limits, change the conditions of certain types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law would benefit or an additional load on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law, certainly a step in the right direction, and, I hope, it is confirmed.
The problem which may arise is that the rules of the "tougher" and them it will be impossible to comply with.
When the functioning of the previous rules of the regulated companies together with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programmes - with the regional Council) that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means the violation of budgetary discipline.
Whether in the case of enforcing the law in such a way?
I think that this is not the way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error, does not affect the decision.
Such a system only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path will not lead.
The Prime Minister has recently said that the FOC will not be disturbed by employers ' inspections of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does it mean?
"Schwartz-system" is prohibited or allowed?
The law should be in any way established, and, if that's what he forbids, and the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the bodies, which are obliged to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say: "We will change the law and allow it", but we can not say that we will pretend that nothing was happening.
The law on public procurement has a rather strict rules, how and what should formally be carried out, and this is correct. It protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is a tragedy, when the candidate with the best proposal disqualified only because of formal defects.
The law will not be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough.
The road slippery places, but mostly passable.
In some places the Czech Republic road frozen and snow-covered.
Basically they are passable, but in some places with greater caution.
The Karlovy vary region
Today in the morning in the Karlovy vary region, the roads were passable, but in some places the frozen and snow-covered.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should gradually warmed.
Snowfall in the region was stopped only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, on the backs of the Ore mountains is about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places was more low visibility due to fog.
The highway R6 and roads of the first class in the region at the present time passed without any restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface may be намерзшая and slippery.
Also all the roads that are relevant to the second and third class, including mountain road, passable.
But on some of the sites still are remnants of the cold and places заезженного snow.

The road I/43 and I/34, located at the Свитави, treated with chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of the Krkonose mountains and Орлицких mountains.
Заезженный layer of snow is on the road, located on the hills in the areas of Рихнова-over-Кнежноу and Трутнова.

Shimon Орнест At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month must come the end of the world?
This is just one of the many troubling news, on which we, the people, so easy to fall.
Together with The Tap Tap we constantly make jokes on this subject, and we say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy, to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you expound on that readers?
It is about the national event to raise funds, which we are planning now for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, the end of which was declared on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before the event, the 20-th of December, at 21:00 in parallel will start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They run out, roughly speaking, at the moment when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific ocean, and the time zone of which the 12 hours earlier, than at us, the end of the may calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, but then we all had together with our artist Гонзой Аугустой.
Apart from the fact that we want to build up enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to work with the community to think over what the state of this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on site www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time to assist us.
The Tap Tap together with other musicians also sang the national anthem against the end of the world, which is called "the End of the world cancelled."
To hear already fond of listeners YouTube anthem for these бенефисных concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will turn out well and the end of the world will not come.
It sing all the actors in the concerts at the same time.
Hymns at the same time will be performed also in live broadcast on Czech television.
The words to this song I wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip of Tom Ганак, participates in the fulfillment also Xindl X...
As you begin to work with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts.
Try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, they are interesting.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
On purchase of the equipment for accessible educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year, so we are working with civil Association Tap at the Institute of Едлички.
Teachers regularly visited by students of schools of the Institute of Едлички and spend with them fun and interesting activities.
The students themselves have no money to go to the teachers, and we try to thus give them this opportunity.
In the framework of the project of additional construction of the Institute Едлички in the future I will separate building, in which we go with this project.
At every concert will perform several music groups and performers.
What were the criteria for selection?
We tried to make a program, which will be interested in all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marjan Банго and Jiri Suchy.
All the details you can find on site www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "great event" in the future?
In may will be the first to speak at the festival "Prague spring" and then, of course, prepare interesting program with interesting guests.
In next year we would be happy to have a representation in the Czech national building in new York, and I personally, if we are in the USA, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with expensive in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their stroller must travel in the cargo area, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with the tools.
However, until cope with it without problems. Czech airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways has always been superb for us prepared that me how many times wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare different country from the point of view of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities and so on.
With what you have experienced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where all is better than that of the us, in Russia we have witnessed the fact that the East is still at a basic level.
Compared with Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a rarity independent movement of the person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also not there in the course of such trivial things as to give way to the disabled person in the Elevator.
Fortunately, there and there are already public organizations, which are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we should always catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance that far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid, it is normal for people with severe disabilities walk on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the Museum, Yes anywhere...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to take active part in public life, in that we are them with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
The esteem of the public or accessibility is one thing, but in the moment, when the us will appear famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, that's when it really starts to change.
While these are isolated cases, people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap at the present time is very popular, but let's go back to two years ago that, in 1998, made you organize it?
I entered the Institute of Едлички as a teacher, around me were many young people who wanted to do something.
And since I myself am a musician and play including the saxophone, together with a colleague organized interesting music club.
Well, and with time, as our leading Ladya Ангелович, it is a bit out of control (laughs).
The popularity came only in the last few years, or I have something mixed up?
It's true that we helped that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, in fact as though does not exist.
Due to European Union, we can afford to qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Standing there in front of you aim so well unleash The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In Show-business is full of things that mimics one another.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I would venture to say that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural...
But the pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all abandoned personalities, which we should feel sorry for me.
They are the people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities it turns out, this shift is not only for them, but also for the whole society.
Provided whether the success of the fact that you're a tough leader, what you consider the many?
If we want to do good work, we should be in many things uncompromising and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, but when they learn that two times a week they should go to the rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At the present time in the group of The Tap Tap twenty people.
How many of them was in the beginning in 1998?
Only one Making Ангелович.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent it.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium Incheba, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava in the centre of the Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
In the end of the concert all three cities are connected телемостом at the time of performance of The song of The Tap Tap "the End of the world cancelled."
The objective of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for the purchase of a multifunctional accessible equipment for educational centre STUDEO at the Institute of Едлички in Prague.
A ticket for the concert is 400 kroons, for children up to 12 years old are free. Tickets can be bought in advance in the Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
At last week's meeting of Ministers of the European space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA September 12, 2008).
Poland began collaboration with ESA in 1994, and during the subsequent years, took an active part in a number of projects of the Agency.
But the way to outer space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the Second world war, Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but this is not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, about the lecture And. Штернфельда, which on December 6, 1933 represented in the astronomical Observatory of the ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to engineering".
The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905.) leave the audience indifferent, after several years of Штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Ian Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France Штернфельд won the Robert Esnault-Пельтри and Andre Louis Hirsch for the "Introduction to engineering".
Dr. Ian Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), which was mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became known world promoter of space, and its contribution was estimated at including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway trolley, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear even to disperse or to stop the trolley was to be used rocket.
Information about this the cart is known only from the press of the time.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about the missile arrows.
A study conducted Section technology weapons in collaboration with professors Mieczys? Вольфке and Gustav Мокжицким.
Of the remaining materials shows that the research progressed to the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German troops work was interrupted.
In 1937 in specialized print the idea of the photovoltaic missile destroyer, which was proposed by the engineer Rogosinski, and in the following year came the work of "Air missile-torpedo, and aviation rocket-bomb" of the author Леливы-Кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all of the projects of the military use of missile technology was engaged in the Interim scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity the end of the outbreak of the war.
The following scientific work devoted to the cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about the company mentioned in the November issue of 1954 of the journal "Problems", which contains four large article on Astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Суботович proposed to organize a society, which will be engaged in space science and technology.
At that time already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish society of Astronautics (PHA) tried to join the international Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn, it became its full member.
And in the following year, the first Chairman of the PHA Kazimierz Заранкевич (1902 - 1959) was the Vice President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this position he remained until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, made a scientific study.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable to overcome a distance of 1800 m, was in the length of about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later there was built the advanced version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on the Бледовском wasteland, tests were carried out a two-stage missile RM-2.
The missile was in the length of about 1.4 m, and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work " rocket RM-34 could overcome 14,5 km, and its task was watching high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor of the first missiles of the RM became rocket meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Were developed three types (identified as meteor-1A, -1B and 1C), which varied the size of the camera for the scientific equipment.
Rocket meteor-1A had the space of a volume of 0.4 l, meteor-1B - 0,34 l, and meteor-1C - 0,62л.
Maximum flight range with all three types is 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 in the Aviation Institute was the development of rocket meteor-2 and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket meteor-2 with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring the payload weight of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then were built version of meteor-2 and meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee on space research) in 1960, and the establishment of the national Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, in the framework of the program Intercosmos, Poland participated in the research of outer space for the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir Ремека.
The repeal of the act on public works - it is not a solution.
Last week the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decree provoked lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, is not limited to the movement of private capital together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the significant differences in the price of labour (wages) there is a price voltage.
Under this concept you need to understand the condition, when the manufacturer by means of delivery of cheap goods tries to survive in economic competition of the fact that the "knocks" the cost of a competitor with a view to pick up a large part of the market and, thus, increase their own income.
On a mass scale it means for the majority of the employers or the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchase abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labor force, compared with other, high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the produced by them unemployment, the growing necessary expenses of the state for social needs.
In General, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the masters of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social, the economic and social harm done by them in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known, there is no need to give specific statistical data.
Vulgar methods of private capital create in the economies of individual States situation, when the governments of the countries are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the purpose of attraction of foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population at the mercy of the private capital, in spite of the social decline.
This is reflected first of all in the changes of the current legislation.
The aim is economically force his people to obey the dictates of private capitalл first of all in the sphere of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as an instrument of reduction of workers ' rights in the sphere of labour legislation.
The result is increased levels of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between the rich and poor .
In Germany already for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves from their work.
The number of these people is already close to a million.
In the framework of improving the competitiveness of the German economy and there are frequent cases when employed people receive a salary, that the state must pay, that they receive the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern States of the EU, undoubtedly, lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of the catastrophic decline in the social status, forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on starvation wages on the margins of society, in the hope that someday will come to the country private investment capital.
However, the question is, from where will it come?
If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty move from one country to another, or he did not come at all, so as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media ad nauseam argue that the state can not participate in the capital of their own farm, which controlled economy leads to economic collapse.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the government should not control the actions to intervene in the economy.
Further, it should answer the question, not whether private capital, is now virtually managing policies and so the entire state, in his own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is Yes.
The proof is the existence of an almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all States.
As a result we have a desperate situation, manifests itself in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserved the punishment, however, is not a crime.
In Germany the situation is such that the public Ministry due to lack of financial resources entrusted with drafting the private law firms, which are closely connected with the industry.
Then these bills approves the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Constitution of the Western type, and from the financial and powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious, that the liberal-oriented democracy now is quickly in such a situationи as described Аппианом in his work иthe Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeyея :the State has long breaksс and departments engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining of favor with the help of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the elections with pre-sold voice""...decent people do not stand for election to the post of Governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without Consul".. .. "Seriously began to speak about the fact that the only salvation in this horrible situation is the autocracy and the need to choose energetic man ".. Appian thought it would be Pompey, but they became Caesar, which has replaced democracy to autocracy.
Just as in ancient times, the modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without consideration of public interests.
Private capital is already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any efforts to reform deeper nature.
So the cause of the fascist and Communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of democracy liberal type can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.
First of all it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, Humanities and social catastrophe, which already we are seeing, along with crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and new history.
The repeal of the act on public works, is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and at the national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this tendency is of a systemic nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will allow to strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company in favour of the state.

The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, has caused many responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing its position by the fact that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are acting in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in the recurrent waves of killings - the perpetrator and victim, in the end, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and do not have witnessed the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, to see the person first of all serve as a continuing already 95 years voltage (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning backed by historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind - it is above all the story of the struggle for power.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - always if these people are completely independently take steps, or for the throne was a someone, who guided their actions to advance the goals.
Have to admit that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and resulting from them power could not happen in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is allocated one, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I don't know if someone above them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
A lot about them do not write.
Of course.
The first news Agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 90-ies of the 19 century, to stop the rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher realms, in the shadow of which they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or both, and to ensure, and to the other.
They have a large block of shares in almost all the Central banks of the world, and against the countries whose Central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was a total of 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow Gaddafi was only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the Central Bank of their country into their own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist the family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank for Ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the civil war he began to publish their own (meaning - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F.. Kennedy began to issue its own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal reserve system), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after the fact, as wanted to sue the FED for the outbreak of the Great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859, in 1871 led to the development plan of the three world wars, created great Freemason of the 33-th level of albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchial States in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population of up to approximately 0,5-1 billion people (a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be otherwise, except as the prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the working group of the wealthiest families in the Chapter with the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of the decision (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the reason the FED, which was to prevent a repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the First world war by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia, starting Bolshevik революциию.
The first world war ended sudden, unjustified in military and economic terms capitulation of Germany (already it was not necessary to war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, there was a fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second world war, the bankers and the politicians have created a hidden conflict situation, put it on Germany huge war reparations, it created a prerequisite to a radicalization of the impoverished masses, then could only throw the Germans strong enough, denouncing the perpetrators, and offers simple solutions Leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a heavy German minority, which was to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, with kindling of the fire of war.
At the end of the 19-th century the Rothschilds have provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the preconditions for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, was the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
Ignited the Second world war, it is difficult to assess, escaped Hitler of the circuits, in which he was initially held bankers, or all that he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by the war reparations to the 2nd world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a hotbed of war of the third.
If the international bankers can get her to untie, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, has become a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, easier speaking, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel - it is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspiration to the world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish between ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, the international bankers pushed the people to vote in the elections by their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing the best to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given the control of Iran over Ормузским Strait, containing 20% of all world oil reserves (Maritime corridor is only 2 miles wide), and also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now manifest the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All that we need is a General breakdown crisis, and the people accept the new world order."
The new world order in their opinion, it is a world of masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of the financial aristocracy, enjoying comfort.
A world where everyone is born the body at birth gets chip, with whom he becomes a being, which is under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave have on the right hand or on his forehead the mark, so that a person, which is not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
That's what wisdom: everyone who has a mind, can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred threescore and six.
Film "Operation "Argo": When the worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took hostage of 52 diplomat.
They should have been released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which was the patron Saint of his regime for decades.
For the us administration to a positive outcome of the situation do not suggest she could not afford to throw away the Shah overboard, because it is in the root could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, she was not able to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations with the mediation of the government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused the house of a wave of solidarity and bred anti-Iranian sentiment.
Defeat in Iran to a great extent contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of 1980, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, срежессированный actor Ben Affleck "Operation "Argo" describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of the six workers managed to escape.
After a challenging twists and turns they had completed their way to the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the canadian authorities managed to take them out of Iran, with the help extravagant a cover story, according to which they went to the canadian passports as members of the crew, подыскивавшие in the country of location for the filming of science-fiction epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "the evacuation" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the film project , arranged press conference, a fictitious manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time kept secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
The film Аффлека - it is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political Thriller, the so-called "film-киноопус", the story of a successful venture, Scam - an example could be a number of films about the friends Оушена.
In the film are constantly changing moods on the one hand, documented conceived scene from Tehran (in the credits are shown significant historical photos of the events and the way the same situation were shown in the movie " the big differences in the no).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies of the men in suits discuss the situation at the table of negotiations, on the stairs institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Аффлеку wonderful managed to restart career.
From высмеянного actor became a respected film Director, and his game has ceased to be object of ridicule.
"Operation "Argo" his third film, after dark detective "good-bye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and the Thriller "the City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film Аффлека, which is not removed in the native city of the Director - Boston.
The sense of place in this refers to the qualities, which raised earlier films over Hollywood standard.
And Affleck manifests it in the "Argo", where Tehran of "playing" Canada.
The best scenes in the movie are taking place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the Embassy are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when somewhere suddenly changed history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues make the scenes fake (fake headquarters at the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The Director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes film values.
He is working quite well with this a little, sometimes that something to think out - where all of this is not so elegant (a scene in which a telephone call to America prevents the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the pursuit of the landing runway look pretty far-fetched).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters deserved to have more space, and they are in the movie by far not the only ones.
The film Аффлека lacks a bit of drama, this is the movie that can be watched with mild interest in assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating mystery / Thriller seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for a reminder about the one, all the more in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated idea of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence.
Rules inflate the balloons, bananas and circus
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.comannually, the interviewer about the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decree or project from the workshop of the EU".
"We got to the last event, in which the EU is planning to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," - said "the Law", the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the already put forward by the nomination абсурдностей is the recent decision of the European court of unification of the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far women have benefits for life insurance, because insurance companies they objectively are less exposed to risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can be nominated in the competition until the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," said Nager.
To the controversial regulations of the EU applies, for example, and the mandatory addition of biological components in the fuel, that as a result of causing harm to the nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or the Directive on the amount of cages for chickens, in consequence of which in this year significantly risen eggs .
Also criticised was the de facto ban on the use of the term "бутербродное oil" or withdrawal from the sale of the classic light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be the length of 14 inches.
The pan-European machine often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels usually protected by any state or group of States (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of the Council of Europe upholds the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union should reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to be "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonises existing disparate national rules, which complicated the trade.
The EU, in spite of the opposition of some States, all the same softened standards for fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directives will lead to the waste products.
Candidate to win in the survey can be and last year's decision of the EU, according to which sold balloons must be equipped with warning that children under eight years of age may not inflate them without supervision of adults.
The EU appealed to American studies, in accordance with which the balloons in the game are the potential causes of infant death by suffocation.
Such restrictions now apply for children up to 14 years, who are prohibited from blow at a fair dudelki.
Funny ideas are born and home
Enough is absurd and rule concerning the European officials that everyone who is in the EU any official position, may not, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, the use of the name Macedonia, and should instead say "FYROM (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Union of liberal economists "the Principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above mentioned absurd rules, for example, the rule of the EU on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the member States.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which she had a big fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire was also interested in the idea of pay some countries, because they have no sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for the application for receiving subsidies.
But these ideas appeared in Prague, and not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.
Ask the European Union about compensation", - stated in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ЧСДП).
As an argument he pointed out that the country had high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases the state had the full warehouses of stocks, which had to be evacuated.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies offered villages of the Ministry for regional development, led by the Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on the preparation of applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Weird orders are the exception
Although regulations in member States easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU to regulate, as well as on the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the utilisation of the EU on projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, however, which the member States have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
Causes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right on the specific identity of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians have kept the name "Оломоуцкие cheese", but "Туземский rum", a tradition which in our country have their roots in the 19th century, our producers were to rename the "Туземак".
Be called rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheese "feta" and "горгондзола", marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parma ham, have already been, for example, the Karlovy vary crackers, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий hops.
Also a trademark of the EU can be proud of пардубицкий carrot and горжицкие tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an Amateur, - says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, as a man comes into his head to run for the post of the President?
I do not think that to become a Senator or the President.
If in our country we have all functioned without any problems, then I wouldn't have had any run.
But I can not see how in the last 20 years, the country can be stolen, as here, the bustling thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like it, then try to find a solution, how to change it.
And since I already was full forty years old and I'm an independent person, not belonging to any party, I have no other opportunities to influence things, except to run for the post of a Senator or the President.
In the Senate, you have got, but soon went to the President's castle.
Do not turn if you so back to the people who you choose?
I talked all the time, that the turn in the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the results of the election to the Senate.
Later I said that if I selected a Senator, I will run for the presidency.
My goal is not a position, the position - it is a tool, with the help of which I can implement their views.
So I need the most impact, and extensive powers.
But the difficulty is not only in the fact that we as a nation murmur among themselves in the bar or in front of the TV, but it ready to trample on anyone trying to change something.
To this are added the mass media, which human tarnished, and which confuse freedom of speech with the freedom of lies.
For example, I said that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was the Advisor Jiri Пароубека.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the theses of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property declarations to the amount of over twenty million.
To achieve this, it is necessary to change the law.
You have as a President of such powers is not, and only a Senate may propose laws.
How you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct excursions became free enterprise, it managed to promote.
The problem is политиканстве - when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or to the right, he deliberately thwarted, and this constrains the citizens.
As an independent non-party man, I have a much greater potential for obtaining support from all of the parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party folded on the shelves, without regard to the dogmas can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man, more related to the right or to the left?
From the Czech point of view it seems to me that the people I relate more to the left.
For me is not at all important - a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me it is important that we go forward.
It is not that someone applies to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I always support any good for the company's decision, will suggest whether it КПЧМ or the FOC, and I sure as hell would be against bad idea.
You get angry when someone says that you are populist.
But not proving to you that what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some kind of ideal goals and views.
And to this you try to come closer.
You can call it populism, but all proposals, to which I say, already operate in the world, or speak of them prominent experts.
But without the support of the Parliament you will only slogans.
And with this in politics, you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you walk up to people and talk to them, then you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Only convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to win them over to their side, so we have made it.
If I were elected President, it shouldn't be a problem to organize the direct television broadcast, in which I will return to the presidents of the parliamentary parties with an appeal to legitimize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will need to inform, why didn't want to.
If there is a strong personality, which makes abuse, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President - it was the merit of pressure from the public.
Say directly that I am an Amateur and not a genius and not intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I'm only a beginner in politics, and the program will try to get support of the majority.
The case, I try to promote their own; in that case, if it does not succeed, after six years of finish and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds like Okamura must save the Czech Republic.
I'm not the Savior.
I know that one I wouldn't do anything, so I walked around a number of well-known people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Радиму Янчуре, he refused in connection with great volume of the work.
Well at least I supported the leading investigative journalist Jan Лоренцову, which revealed the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but right now I feel like in the balance.
Sixty percent of people did not go to the elections, but the majority of those who went to selected representatives of the establishment.
We are independent in the Senate, only two.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of his own party?
About this I have not thought, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past each of the potential supporter, and I don't have the money for it.
There is no money for a presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You have no money?
You are talking about property declarations, how about your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated approximately in 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague value of approximately 25 million, apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of the works of art of approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda superb in a million, well, a few million on the account.
By the way Aston-Martin came to me, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked James bond, who traveled by car, was gallant with the women and at the same time, fought against the baseness and wickedness.
You drive the Aston-Martin, own property at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money especially in this invest not want to.
It is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million to the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
In the campaign I have already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, testifies to the fact that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the pre-election campaign out of his own pocket.
Expenditure on the campaign me in fact cover сенаторская salary.
But for this money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son of the English school, which is 30 thousand per month.
If I wanted only to earn money, so anywhere would not run.
So, then you will engage in entrepreneurship, so that you can live?
Didn't you say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, its activities I partially reduced.
For example, the managing Director of a tourist Agency in the spring will be my Deputy.
People would like to, that I was бессребренником, which will store the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
How many, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to receive on a monthly basis?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, I get further and further.
And if I became President, his business would have ended.
The full interview you can find in the Saturday issue of the paper "Right".
Architects MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example Спейкениссе and its newly built Book mountains - 2 photos
"This building seems fun, it looks futuristic, finally we again can see something interesting," says Lisette Верхайг, entrance on the side of the road.
And Stephen Спермон, it specialist at the nearby large enterprise, thinks so: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need today is another library?
All have Internet access, iPad, and e-books.
Now there are no volunteers going to the old-fashioned library, right?
Спейкениссе, малопримечательному a residential campus under the Rotterdam, belongs to the unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying fact a few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution to General education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on banknotes of Euro, in the form of beautifully painted miniatures from reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build here the library!!!
Blame Maas from Rotterdam's architectural Bureau MVRDV, master bold bar charts and the author witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, reacted to a problem with his usual calmness and appeared on the competitive listening in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury in a puzzled look and shook his shoulders, daring Maas resigned from his original gift to a pyramid in size and completed a speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Portrait mountain" in Спейкениссе, the so-called Букенберг!
Nine years later, this mountain value of 30 million Euro has increased.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground Parking garage, a supermarket, post office and a few of the adjacent houses and villas for a total of 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November "Portrait mountain" was awarded with the second prize of the contest "the Best library of the Netherlands in 2012".
Also the project participates in the national Dutch competition wooden structures 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, who previously could not offer anything except post-modern pedestrian area and the amazingly beautiful town hall, the white facades which suggests the idea that the milk-processing factory, became richer by one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing - in Спейкениссе was the first in the history of this town a public building for cultural purposes.
A long road to book
The first impression: book Eldorado under the hood for cheese.
There is only one Elevator that runs through the centre of the mountain, because the real fans of architecture and reading prefer to explore the area on foot.
Остекленное from all sides of the room is bright and easy to foreseeable, floors made of baked bricks and elegant street lights accurately create the feeling of the public of the town square.
The urban environment is recreated ideal.
Eyes involuntarily looking for a bench, dogs and playing soccer boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually bookshelves stand along the facade, and is located in the middle of a large, dark room, as a rule uncomfortable and faceless," said Winnie the Meuse.
We have set the classical configuration space from legs on a head and pulled the area to be read from the inside out.
The internal space of the book of the mountain used skillfully: in the center of the offices are located, online library, chess club, ecological centre and technical premises.
Especially pleased with the black book shelves, which serve as the finish of the walls, parapets, the stair railing.
Their appearance, texture, and smell unusual.
Even seasoned architects and engineers-builders guess, what kind of unknown material.
"We sought to work with secondary materials", - explains Йоп Трауборст, project Manager, representing the community Спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on one agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met the appropriate by-product of agriculture.
For many years in the greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots of applied artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles is one season, and after that it can be disposed of.
For the library is the canvas for the first time in such volumes were Packed in the thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into the dark, uniform, strong material, to smell a little reminiscent of a new car and a little sneakers.
On top conduct 105 degrees.
Those who overcome the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch крокетами and wood фикусами in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all on the correct humidity of the air in the literary mountain.
The costs of a new soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of the environment," says Троуборст.
For its heating and cooling is used warmth of the earth.
Although the Portrait mountain stands under a glass cover, even on clear days, the sun enters the only briefly.
Broad farm laminated wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take on the most of the sun's rays.
Indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by a fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Спермон, mentioned above, a skeptic of the it sector, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Верхайг also was there.
As well as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Богард, which is called Букенберг "the soul of Спейкениссе, which has long lacked".
The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate a book from his own collection.
These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves of the not yet fully developed the library - at that time it was of 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves crammed to the top.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", " the architect says blame Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every inhabitant in some way connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the Royal task, which at the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Спейкениссе wrote his literary history.
And even if they are very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for the construction of identity.
Szabo: "the Germans have to play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow the diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week of Germany first made it clear that she will vote against the application of the Palestinians to receive observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israel in Gaza.
Now Germany it is necessary to be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that the American position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - it is not speaking too critical with respect to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of exclusion zone for flights.
In the end, NATO held this proposal.
Germany it is difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The fact that she is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely, moving from policy, which, so to speak, ruled by the United States, to actually German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no agreed a common policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between two fronts.
From them it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I believe that as long as they only look for their part, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which conducts France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly means "normal" foreign policy with the German point of view?
It is a willingness to hold in its own national interest position that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on the economic policy, that is, from the export and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and so Germany must defend its interests.
Whether these economic interests to the position in the middle East conflict and to the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the middle East, in particular in the States of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I would not give it too much importance, it is not entirely one-way communication.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Harmed, whether Germany its relations with the United States, while making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States prevails understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that it was the same dramatic breakdown, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will acquire thus some respect.
It indicates that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The us, on the contrary, clearly spoke for the veto.
If there is a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Into force of the American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I think that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation of the government, of course, could not openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant divergence of opinion is not so significant, as always seems to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not in delight from the policy of Netanyahu.
Is it easy to Germany combine their close ties with Israel and the us on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, the Germans would have been a little easier if there was a common, consistent European policy, but this is not so today.
Therefore, they may not be part of the broader approach and forced instead to act, relying only on our own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the Euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a lead role in the development of common European positions.
It is clear that in Germany it is difficult, if only because of the ties with Israel.
This issue has always been difficult.
But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player - do not take the himself really the main role?
Or the leading role of the still difficult to give Germany?
Germany still not used to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still always difficult to give a significant role to play.
Consider, for example, the crisis of the Euro - every time, when Germany takes on a major role, manifested the various antigermanskie feelings.
The Germans did not just deal with that.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account the very different neighbours and opinions, but this is not easy.
Thus, the influence of the USA in European politics is constantly diminishing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is?
The Germans just going to have to play a more significant role.
Even if you don't like it, unpleasant or strengthens a dislike to you - this is the life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when the Puma, and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is absolutely officially registered in China, the name which has nothing in common with the firms from the names of which it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names is not submit a claim.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Паттлох, the lawyer of the company Taylor Wessing, specializing on violations of the rights to the trademarks in the Russian far East.
On my Desk every week appears on the new case of this kind.
Bone substitute is enough to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci turns Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
This way legally copied German companies, for example producer of sports goods Puma.
Паттлох opens the folder with records of the Department of registration of trademarks in Beijing.
on 14 September 2010, a Chinese company is registered there's trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the world Champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property rights, is well known.
In big cities there are multi-storey Department stores, selling almost exclusively forgery.
However, the case Паттлоха not such. On behalf of our principals ' it is against that Chinese enterprises officially received from the Department of registration of the trademark the right to use a name that already protected by somewhere else.
The Chinese call this "ban минпай", mark-the passenger.
This word is associated with the "ban дакуань".
The so-called women looking for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilty
"It causes damage to the business, it is necessary to struggle", - is convinced Паттлох.
"Trade mark is washed away, the unique position of being lost, image suffers greatly".
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors is estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive original products.
According to the company for market research at CLSA, China with a sales volume of EUR 15 billion per year is the third in size and the most rapidly growing market for luxury goods.
However, to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the register of trade marks difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Паттлох tells about cases in which the court rejected the claims, because after a long time опротестованное name became "the reality of the market."
If the claimant does not lucky, it will even have to pay плагиатору, as the damage to its trade mark in China, said Паттлох.
Sometimes is ruled by the law of the jungle.
There is also the famous works of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company Daimler lost a court dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, enterprise, which shortly before the acquired firm-manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of Mercedes.
Bought Volvo company Geely originally used the blue-and-white logo, like a BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Manufacturer of fashionable goods Lacoste lost in the bone substitute China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
Department of registration of trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirms that in the year 2010 because of the shortage of personnel and equipment of the premises there took place the difficulty.
But in the past year there has been a "return from the emergency situation in the working process of the norm".
So, the quantity of raw Affairs on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
It was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the office.
To combat this expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trade marks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China, for the tenth time in a row headed the list of new registrations around the world, reports the Agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademark, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011 was paid 1.8 billion yuan charges.
If to simplify, this means that each registration worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euro.
Appeal against its worth many times more, as shown by the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group is fighting against the Chinese плагиатора.
The Germans succeeded in ensuring that the illegal production of them counterfeit automotive parts, was liquidated.
However, the simulator secured the Chinese the right to a trade mark Freudenberg.
It was his own omission, as the names in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Вентцлер, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the office of the registration of the trade marks CTMO rejected the claim of Munich.
However, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to struggle so far.
You must be on the alert
The question now is on consideration in the Supreme court.
Вентцлер hopes to bring it to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the Process is extremely roads and it takes a lot of time, money and nerves".
Internal costs are hardly taken into account, the archive of the company had to look even acts of a hundred years ago, to bring evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg to no avail offered by the opposing side of the "big six-figure sum in euros" for a settlement.
"From this it is clear how much that we should," says Вентцлер.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even in Europe.
Namely, in the case of simulators register there for a unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register a name of Freudenberg for footwear and leather products.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
"We must be vigilant," says Вентцлер.
Both he and lawyer Паттлох recommend that German enterprises to be very careful with China.
Is not enough to rely on the international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be "all that in any way worth defending, register also in China," says Вентцлер.
Otherwise it can cost much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lose in the final act of his drama about the trade mark, he shall pay the other party a license fee for their own name, explains Вентцлер.
Otherwise, we will supersede from the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS day: притоптывать, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg choir rehearses Имбонги - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice with it.
The history of relations that overcome a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First hear a tapping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, handbags boats and men's Slippers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that, slowly picking up the voices of the singers - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they are coming, enchant and follow each other.
And Фите Хопф, the 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of her cloth shoes, when leading their flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg choir Имбонги rehearsing a new song.
At the rehearsal came fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from специалистки on human genetics to the porter.
"Om"Aubagne" is not a simple thing, every voice choir has its own text, in addition to a completely alien language: the same, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations programme on HIV / AIDS, in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected people.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
In Swaziland live 245 000 AIDS orphans.
With more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 of AIDS orphans in the village of Эситжени Association Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school in preparation for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on the patronage of the corps.
It ensures the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot meal in The centre.
Имбонги in the same language means the narrator or восхвалитель.
In this hall do not speak fluently on the Bantu, but know how to sing.
Almost ten years the choir learns the songs on this alien soft language and from time to time even bring them back to where they first appeared: in South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers the summer of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village Эситжени, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
're infected with forty percent of the
There live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who have died from the virus ICH.
In Эситжени in miniature reflects the disease of the whole Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the world's lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection by half, among the population almost not accepted.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland are in themselves immunodeficiency virus, the death of the middle of the fourth dozen - not a rarity.
The choir opened the village in the joint field visit to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants of Имбогни saw a lot of children on the streets, which is not enough not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education a person in a poor country there is no chance.
At first it was a private obligation of the individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later, the choir founded the Association "Voices for Africa", which has since almost professionally caring for orphans of AIDS in Эситжени.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
To bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and триппер (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Лобковый pediculosis and scabies are to parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, and the conveying occurs as a result of sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults frequent sexually transmitted diseases, are chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhoea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have a comparatively low, however, about 20 per cent of new HIV infections belongs to this group.
Among young people chlamydial infections are found significantly more often than among other groups of the population.
On the European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people is also a common human papilloma virus.
How to change the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to obligatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007 reduced.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to венерическое disease?
In infectious diseases may occur ulcers in the field of гениталий, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can he protect himself?
Female condom can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide absolute protection.
Partly because the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases, may also be spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.
That is why experts recommend routine screening, especially with the frequent change of sexual partners.
In the early diagnosis can cure the majority of STIs and avoid long-term consequences.
Patronage, donations and not in the last turn royalties for performances of the choir for the whole of Germany allow something to collect.
"All we have sent to Эситжени already about 200 000 euros," says Annette Леннартц, Chairman of the Association.
In the village of money from Germany disposes of Цодва Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares about the fact that the orphans were well arranged, for example one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as it is called in the same old women, the center of the village.
Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over his head and took care to children in the form of every day in time appeared on the lessons.
Those who have no relatives left, come to the shelter to Ханийсиле, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the Association, as well as two cooks, who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the Association "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built a two coop and together with the American organization of the health PSI organized the delivery of HIV test for many of the residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious in the country, prefer deep silence.
The king, with 14 women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Леннартц, "because it is associated with sexuality".
Quite unusual for a country, in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III, known for his love to excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such authorized state life style also lays the blame for the fact that the virus ICH so spread quickly in the past years.
But she is also on stray workers, who can spread the virus in the country.
Free female condom is literally on every corner, " says Annette Леннартц, "but they are almost not used.
The other culture is flesh of the flesh".
To little to support the cultural exchange, the choir Ибмогни every two-three years, traveled throughout South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern region of the black continent known since the times of apartheid.
Bus full of whites, who sing songs in the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened that caused the tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip is always leads also in Эситжени, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
In spite of the fact that small village with hard to find on the map, in the valley of the river Эцулвени it is more than well known.
"Go to the Эситжени, there is a light," say the people here.
And after 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when топающие singers are back in the rehearsal room on the street Бергхаймер, you can see that this light is lit and here also.
Messenger: NASA opens the ice on mercury
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that the planet mercury is ice.
Ice can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The space Agency of the USA NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as is evident from the three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that constantly hiding in the shadows of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimetres, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or, perhaps, an asteroid collided with mercury.
No one has linked the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the head of the scientific probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how water and other construction elements of life were in other places in the Solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth probes and telescopes and small robots, such as "Phoenix", exploring the depths of the Universe.
From time to time they send to the Ground image: small Windows in the infinite expanse.
The image comes from the camera, which developed a German researchers from the max Planck Institute.

One of the greatest and the most clear pictures of a telescope "Hubble": the Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color pictures of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
Published by the European southern Observatory of the picture shows the remote for a few thousand light-years nebula Трифид in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name of the Трифид comes from the Latin word trifidus (трехдольный, трехраздельный), as the dark band of dust are divided into three parts-hot heart of the cradle of the stars.
In Serpens astronomers have photographed the precursor of a cosmic collision: at the distance of 400 million light-years from Earth kernel of the two merging galaxies rushing to meet each other and will face.

Our views in the Universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Липперсгеем - before Galileo Galilei year later began to observe the stars.
Since then mirror optical telescopes became more and more - and the available of their view of the space deeper.
In the course of 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope "JAL" in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Mirror, shown here, has a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the USA, the Large binocular telescope".
It allows you to watch in space with the help of two mirrors, each with the diameter of 8.4 metres.
"Gran Телескопио Канариас" has a giant internal device - diameter of the one only the mirror is 10.4 meters.
Mirror "of a Large South African telescope in South Africa segmentation - for the sake of reducing the cost.
However in diameter it is roughly eleven meters.
The lack of affordable design: the telescope is rigidly bolted under the vertical angle - this limits his mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-Эберли" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It features: high светособирающая ability.
She reaches - in spite of relatively small diameter of the mirror - the world's largest telescopes.

The Chilean Observatory ESO also plan to install a European "Very large telescope".
Its main mirror should раскинуться on the whole 42 meters and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected not earlier than 2018.
Up to 2007, both telescopes "KEK" in the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
There are two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "KEK" are included in the composition of the Observatory Mauna Kea, which along with them looks at the sky also with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and IRTTF.
In addition, on Mauna Kea there should be a new giant telescope with a mirror diameter of thirty feet.
Here they can admire in the illustration.
However, the most important species from space provides a space telescope "Hubble".
On April 24, 1990, he delivers pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler" looking for planets outside the Solar system - first of all that which makes life possible.
on February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235-planets of the candidates was found with the start of the mission.
The photograph depicted the recent preparation of a space telescope "Kepler".

Scientists suggest that the southern pole of mercury is ice.
However, reliable data on this, as the "Messenger" spinning closer to the North pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, pointing to the fact that mercury is ice.
Thanks to the launched in 2004, the probe "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around mercury - scientists are now sure of this.

Search for clues in a country where 97-year-old men seem to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh mountains can be called the wild and romantic.
A minibus with a rumble on the winding road past overgrown with dense forests of the hills, the rough rivers and simple peasant houses.
All around so green and bright, what you might think, if you were in the black forest.
But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
Here live Talysh - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are spoken in Farsi and азербайжданском and differ longevity.
The end point is Lerik.
A small town boasts too ponderous architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe is almost not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious.
At 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
Legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian sea, here, in the province is not yet reached.
However, Pilate Фатулаева (48) is convinced, that in Lerik, there is something to interest tourists.
"In may of Baku became famous festival Eurovision song contest - and in the next year, there will be a festival of the oldest people of the world," says Фатулаева.
She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, probably unique in the world.
Here is documented biography about eight dozen of the Talysh people of these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, and is 120 years.
At the age of 136 years he had another baby
But the controversial star of the Museum is the shepherd Ширали Мюслюмов, who allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificate, however, is not.
But given the fact that the oldest man, whose age is confirmed by documents, the age of 122 years, the age of the Мюслюмова it is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Фатулаева.
A man has been married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years, he has allegedly daughter was born.
So Li added shepherd Мюслюмов a couple of dozen years to your age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher, age, from the max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of livers in Central Asia.
"A surprising number of people of old age can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia is also a lot of very old people."
However, due to the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, since there was no register of civil status.
Every day a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless it is a fact that people in the district of Lerik is strikingly often reach the biblical age.
Now here lives of 20 people older than 100 years.
Why here, in the South, so a lot of long-livers?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Мугимзаде explains this specific genes of the Talysh people.
The Director of the Museum Фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the case in the diet.
Talysh like meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, many of them to drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such high-calorie diet can be healthy with диетологической point of view.
Or work in a primitive way of life, which keeps people the youth? In Ченгемиране, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Рубаба Mirzoev.
In 97 years, she still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaev, who claims that she has 143 child lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of his sons and the daughter of Mirzaeva, which have long ago already has his grandchildren.
Also nearby ride two kids.
In the kitchen the guests prepare the tea, which is served in the typical pot-bellied glass армуду.
The Mirzaeva perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the head scarf she hides long dark brown tresses that her son with pride to reveal to us.
I always have my hair milk, so that they never fall in and saved the color.
"And I had never used the shampoo", - says Mirzaev.
The monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only that has increased in the private yard, tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I never buy products in the store.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second world war.
But it was better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is often sounds in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult, which is created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan has almost knows no boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins of power took his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, the Azerbaijani elderly there is no poverty.
230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of Euro) Mirzaev receives a monthly basis in the form of a pension, under local conditions, for the amount by which you can live well.
And, perhaps, long ago grew up the son of Mirzaeva, too rights: "the Old men in our culture, enjoy deep respect".
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
What is not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
Revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo testifies to the depth of a split of the country.
The future of the Constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce resistance.
Egyptian President did not skimp on the pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And his success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to all the people, but in the first place to the Christian Copts, liberal, enlightened Muslims and irreligious the Egyptians.
They're all still hopelessly fragmented in the opposition, fear.
The fear of the religious state of the Nile at the mercy of powerful "Brothers-Moslems".
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically said that he was temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its scope of authority, "to save the revolution".
However, what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, with a degree of doctor of the American University of southern California, it is not clear to the Egyptians and to the whole world.
Whether there will be deprived of the power of the judiciary?
In fact 234 article managed to drag in the night of 15-hour race with obstacles in исламистски configured the constitutional Assembly of the 100 participants, and it is partially caused concern.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft States that proceedings is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the "principles"?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vaguely worded and arising out of, in connection with her legal backlash for more than a strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least, on this hint one нововведенная article: in all matters relating to the Shari'a, should be involved to the Council of the University al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution of the country, enjoys great authority in all of Sunni Islam.
This should not, but it could mean that the clergy oversees the legislation that de-facto would have the effect of limiting the judicial authorities.
The draft Constitution of the lot is the subject of the interpretation of
Another problem: should continue jurisdiction of civilians by military court.
These courts in the period of authorities of the Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the plan, the state must preserve the "true nature of the family of Egypt" and "to maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is worded so vaguely that public institutions with the help of this article may be able to control even the content of the film and literature.
Open the text this does not mean that other, as censorship.
No one article does not establish the right of equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting and defaming the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Doubtful it is also the wording of which is prohibited by the "insult of the people".
Is it enough to be a caricature of the President or jokes about the law?
The issue of the interpretation, as many things in this project, which Mursi offers for the signature and which, according to him, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians in the referendum.
"Revolution is back"
Already a few weeks is formed by the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity Friday evening at Tahrir square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"The revolution came back, and we will win", - said Хамдин Саббахи, took third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel peace prize winner and former head of the international Agency on an atomic energy Mohammed ElBaradei stated that the draft Constitution of the place "on the garbage heap of history".
Through the service of short news Twitter he accused supporters of Mursi in the desire to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he had to announce a referendum, we will go to his Palace and off it," said opposition leader Yasser said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers not yet avenged", - quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they do not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized "Brothers-Moslems", in turn, called for the opposite demonstrations, but as a precaution, not on Tahrir square, and after mass prayers on the other Bank of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
Took part in the large number of women under the bedspreads and the adherents of the Salafis, who shouted: "People requires the application of the law of God".
They demanded that the Mursi: "Cleanse the country!" and assured: "the Koran is our Constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic area at which it all started, provoked a state of almost civil war.
The followers of the Mursi, obviously, did not want to take that risk.
"Brothers-Moslems" stated that both the opponents and the supporters of the draft Constitution spoke loud and clear.
Now it is time to give the people to solve at the ballot box, in what direction was to go to the country.
The majority of the project of the Islamists, it is considered to be a done deal.
"The concept of "human rights" is not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu sa'ed in a rage from this forced the constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
the 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the Chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (ЕОПР) defended the "Muslim Brothers", when Мубараке they were in prison or appeared before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because the right person for him indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced and arrested.
And now the words "human rights" is never found in the new Constitution, the regrets he in an interview to "Welt am Sonntag".
Expanding the influence of Mursi on all three branches of power in the state is frustrating to a lawyer.
These measures constitute the overt attacks on democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of trying to strengthen civil state, the de facto President cancelled his" - sorry Sayed said.
Because without civil society organisations democracy cannot function.
Sayed said he feels that all abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and voltage.
For it might come retribution.
The demonstrator at Tahrir square warns: "You are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."
Norwegian ракфиск: the most foul-smelling like fish in the world?
The five millionth population of Norway is one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country is somehow linked with the local addiction to an extremely stinking fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothing.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll have отшибающий smell the smell of ракфиска - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a little town called Фагернес, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around the snow covered scenic views. This is very beautiful, but in the air permeated the evergreen characteristic smell.
Ракфиск are trout, sprinkled with salt and бродившая in the water up to a year, depending on what exactly the duck to do.
As dusk and cold, crowds of Norwegians are going to the festival in Фагернесе, dedicated to this most, so to say, the lovely dish.
"Her eat a raw and washed down with a glass of Aquavita, local тминной of vodka," - explains Хавард Хальварсен, local fire by profession and at the same time "ракфисковый General", which governs the conduct of the festival.
Everywhere around us there are people eat cut in small cubes fish and wash down with her considerable portions of alcohol.
"Someone more like Akwawit than ракфиск," says Хавард.
This drink is able to kill the smell.
I'm trying out a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece of the nose, all is not so bad - little different from that portion of the land, you have taken the bus.
Ракфиск - the Norwegian product of absolutely other times, the times of poverty, when, before the advent of the refrigerators, the fish in the autumn steeped in sealed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in winter, when the fish is well and thoroughly забродила, its extracted and, after the perception of alcohol, used as food.
Still the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, primarily in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, more than 13% are immigrants, which here involve jobs, higher wages and a well-developed social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (longtime rival, and not so long ago, and far more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work.
Ракфиск is perceived as a kind of an important symbol, an indispensable, though, and a few empty element of the last Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you in 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the country it is, it seems, are satisfied with.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Брейвика, racist and extremist right-wing, in the past year расстрелявшего and killed 77 men, women and children.
Not mentioning his name, the attack is called "what happened on July 22".
Norwegians very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
In the basis of today's well-being of Norway lies growth (since the beginning of the seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason of our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, разносящая trays with distinguished ракфиском, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We the people " as you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks very good English.
We don't like to exhibit at the show, we do not boastful.
Norway very carefully treats its oil - most of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special Fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the world financial crisis, when all sorili the money, which they have not had, Norway frugally calculate all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and Hiking in summer, this is sufficient for happiness", - says Anna.
"And there are ракфиск," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for some food - ракфиска good enough for me.
Here's a hamburger with elks meat - it is certainly exotic and tasty juicy meat.
But in the evening we will see even more of the same fish with unforgettable aroma.
In my accommodation are conducting a special dinner dedicated to ракфиск, in the course of which the visitors vote determine the best or, perhaps, the most fragrant fish.
Is direct TV air, in which the show of the bow tie, surrounded by plates with ракфиском.
It's like the song contest "Eurovision".
"So, the top-Jurgen, what grade you set for the best fish they got themselves in the mountains?"
"Yes, Хавард, here's our assessment"....
All laughing and applauding.
Someone falls from the chair may, after going through Aquavita.
And maybe, just надышавшись smell of the fish.
The President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto to be a difficult start of a career.
Until the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to enter the office, a correspondent of the BBC's will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties with which it will face, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Traffic in Mexico city now in especially bad condition.
This city is overloaded transport, and in the best time, and on Monday were erected steel fences, перерезавшие several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done in order not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the participants of the protest to get to the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto put on the presidential band, and will take over the reins of the country.
Before him is not an easy task.
Mexico has made good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which now creates its powers, but the country is mired in the drug war, which for six years already claimed about 60.000 lives.
"My government claims the people of Mexico on its readiness to combat violence", - said earlier this week Mr. Pena Nieto us President Barack Obama in the oval office of the White house.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
To such statements next to the President of the United States political career Mr. Pena Nieto has developed in the post of the Governor of his home state of Mexico city.
In his homeland, in a populous and vast state, the capital of the country, the opinions of the new head was divided.
Straight man
In the idyllic village of Valle de Bravo, for example, remembered him with warmth.
Residents put him in the merit of revival of tourism, the development of the resort sphere and creation of the infrastructure.
You can reach the city on one of the new highway, built by g-Ohm Pena Nieto, which are very different from those roads with potholes and pits, which were previously in this place.
Plate with his name is hung on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive Museum devoted to climate change.
"We associate with him hope for a real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, Congressman of the state of the led Pena Nieto the institutional revolutionary party (PRI).
We expect real and drastic change, which needs so much of our country, first of all in the sphere of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power is the party PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12 years of absence in the presidential Palace Los Pinos party places great hopes on the Enrique Pena Nieto.
In addition, he denied the accusations in бессодержательности that were put forward by the new President of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to the cause of the incarnation of his vision of the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and, first of all, the person, able to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have different perceptions of the former Governor.
The municipality Scoundrel, known as the Ciudad Operations, represents the most striking contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highway overpasses, he is in many ways is a suburb of the Mexico city.
And the problems in the municipality, too, are of a severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the pacification of the bands, selling drugs in these areas, have been involved troops; and violence against women is here particularly acute.
In a vacant lot near the extensive landfill only for last two years it was found several dozens of bodies of murdered women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico city during the governorship Mr. Pena Nieto - it considerably exceeds the similar indicator in the sadly famous violence city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name became a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Pena Nieto, about him in the best case we can say that during his tenure as Governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration was accused in complete disregard of the problem.
The inhabitant of the concrete, like the majority of the homes in the dilapidated area, Irenaeus Буэндия barely holding back tears, showing me photos of his dead daughter Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of Marian in 2010, committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her boyfriend.
"When I got to her house, it seemed that her body before it was washed," recalls Ms. Буэндия.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was cold and stiff.
Mother Mariana recounts this story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs around with a crucifix, on which is inscribed with just one word: justice.
It is in this, according to them, was denied the family.
"Officials of the state have treated me like an old gossip, reluctant breaker of the peace.
They want people simply took for granted all the things that they say, and kept quiet.
But it is wrong, it is impossible, in particular when there are so many violations and gaps," she says.
Wearing a presidential belt on Saturday, the President Pena Nieto together with her take on the formidable task of responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected crimes associated with violence, and the new President promised to make the solution of this problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same President, what was the Governor", - says Olvera, Congressman from Valle de Bravo from the party of the PRI.
But this is exactly what most of all afraid of families of victims in Ciudad Operations.
Bradley manning never complained of ill-treatment, says the accusation.
Prosecutors are trying to deny statements Bradley manning about the poor conditions of detention.
In the course of the hearing focused on the stay of manning the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of detention manning were brutal.
Ratings of the U.S. army are accused of the abduction of several thousands of secret documents.

During cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, military Prosecutor of the major Эшден FEIN said that the record weekly visits manning representatives of the prison administration for the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain complaints on ill-treatment.
Cross-examination in the framework of the consideration of a defense motion to dismiss the case manning on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and of themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the next day after the manning said that while in detention, he intended to commit suicide.
Military expert in the analysis of intelligence data, arrested in June 2010, is accused of the abduction of several thousands of secret documents at the time of service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published in the Internet on the website WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks is not confirmed, the source of the information was manning.
During the hearing on Friday the Prosecutor Fain, together with the Manning looked at the reports that were completed after the visit manning representatives of the administration during his stay in prison Quantico, where he was on terms of strict regime of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison officers asked Manning questions and record the answers.
When the Prosecutor FEIN asked on Friday about the reports, manning admitted that assesses the treatment by the prison administration as "excellent", and the General terms and conditions of as "very professionally organised".
Considered the reports do not contain complaints on ill-treatment, despite the fact that manning directly asked about the terms of its content, claims FEIN.
Manning said that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that visited the representatives of the administration have discussed these problems with him and have stated that they will deal, but did not reflect this in writing.
"They wrote "there are no problems" (after the discussion of my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised this topic in the conversation," says manning.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked manning, why he had not complained of ill-treatment of him in January 2011, during the Commission's meeting was held to consider a suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for a few months before.
Manning said that during the meeting, he wanted to get him removed mode "injury prevention" and softened the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military authorities explained that the limited regime of the prison on the level below, than the regime of supervision in order to prevent suicide - was introduced for the protection of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the security of others.
"I would like to know the administration that I'm all right, so they changed the prevention of injuries... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," said manning.
On Thursday manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he had been detained for two months before was transferred to a prison at the us naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that thoughts of suicide appeared with him in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you do not know, how is your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world had shrunk to base camp Арифжан, to the size of my prison, " said manning on Thursday.
"I thought I would die in this cage".
While in Quantico, manning, according to him, spent most of the time in a small cell " at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, Slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, so as to sleep or even simply lie in the day time forbade the rules.
According to manning, while sleeping in his eyes constantly beat the light entering from the outside of the camera.
If the guards could not see his face, when he turned in bed at night, then, according to him, his cuffed and forced to roll over on his back.

If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left, because they remind residents of the country of the difficult times.
Ruben Наваретте believes that the Mexicans American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico city I walked down the hall for visitors, and drew near to the area of border control and froze on the spot.
Signs pointed to the two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second is for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I a few seconds, stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called a Mexican.
It's just the code name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from new York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped at a complex structure, "an American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need in conventional names or complex designs.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of the bearers of the language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
Because I got my American passport, and stood in a queue for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White house and met with President Obama.
On the agenda there were the usual for the meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, narcotics, and trade.
President Pena Nieto spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico, instead of waking up in the United States.
He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the USA and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the President Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, however, no specific proposals were not heard.
For Mexico relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grudges question.
Most Americans have never thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see the reminder of the events in all.
Therefore it is only any statesman us understand one word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately hear complaints about the fact that Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma преисполняются militancy.
The most complex is the relationship of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Want to talk about insults?
Enough of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people, who find in this country for themselves of the opportunity, and those for whom there is no such possibility.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San-Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for one reason only: at some point in their family history who-either the father or grandfather had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.
More often it was the Mexicans of a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from a poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember this.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today our life is an embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and settled on the good work, but we should not forget the fact that even this dream is the American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination of confusing and it is not clear, but we know which country consider their own.
The United States Of America.
Besides, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We tell them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as to the real Mexicans.
We are not well speak in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We shouldn't have been now for a silk curtain, found in the us, full of life, but have lost spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States in the early childhood, and it reminds me of the fact that between the Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there is some friction, Mexicans clearly aware of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin which is a shame.
It is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots.
In Mexico we Americans.
But in the us we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relations without enough confused, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore the relationship with the Diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin have worked a kind of the ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell their friends, the Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great her to attend, and could convince political leaders to strengthen the links with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will come of it.
Too many wrongs in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rampant corruption and drug-trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
Sorry, but I'll leave that to it, Amigos.
And this is true.
If part of the Mexicans still can't forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they would have to take and the fact that some Americans are of Mexican origin still resent the fact, as recently in Mexico did to their relatives.
Yes, it is.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.
The old battle on the new middle East
The agreement on cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas can be a fragile Foundation for the future of the world
Is it possible to have a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes one to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound that became habitual, meaningless debate about who started it; many of the buildings were turned into ruins; killed over 140 Palestinians, most of which were civilians, and six of Israel; for the first time during the conflict, issued by Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel tel-Aviv and the Holy city of Jerusalem.
However, in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in its age-old conflict in the middle East there came a change.
To that can be treated differently, but the events of "Arab spring" circled in the breakaway Bure many of the established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis could not stay away from the vortex, devastated region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
The war without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire, agreement on which was signed on 21 November, will be carried out that have occurred this week collision only strengthened the position of security officials from both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007. declare that they have forced Israel to retreat, in spite of the incurred losses.
In spite of the fact that some leaders of the groups have been destroyed, and the 1.7 million residents are locked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact Hamas growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan river - another Palestinian-controlled territory at the present time the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.
A resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which once had been the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, has acted with the support of the Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The triumphant supporters of Hamas declare the creation of around Israel Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the North, ruled by a paramilitary group Hezbollah, and Syria, in which all the more происламистские insurgents now overthrown the power of Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where the power of the king threaten allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Mohammed Mursi strengthened the influence of Muslim Brothers.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt in the course of 30 years and was overthrown in 2011. was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention to the support of Hamas.
Brothers-the Muslims, on the contrary, are an organization that is largely consistent with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In the future diplomatic representation Hamas can be a significant player, whose voice is not able to drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, proponents of the "hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense of Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli missile defense system "Iron dome" justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of running Hamas rockets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanging position; many European countries have also laid the blame for the start of the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
In spite of the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the walls, which comes on the West Bank of the Jordan river - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of the Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressively minded conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.
What is the point to pander to the Palestinians and to give them a state of their own?
If to give in their hands all the power in the West Bank, wouldn't they run from there rockets in the direction of Israel, as do their counterparts in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and brutally suppressing any attempt to lift her head.
Perhaps, the supporters of the "hard" line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted Arab spring.
At that, the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be the internal problem.
The defense portion of the budget of Israel, more than in all of its Arab neighbors combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional superpower will hardly help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, which together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire is a good sign and could well mark the beginning of a change.
Israel, to a lesser extent, to take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
As of democratic change in the Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later explode on the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus, blown up in tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only compounding the problem.
The bloody operations, which are conducted every few years on the territory of the Gaza strip to suppress the movement Hamas, have to pay a growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need for the external pulse
There remains only one solution, to which constantly call sensible representatives from both sides, and also a great part of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States, and the assignment of Israel territories in exchange for security.
There is a hope, not too impressive in the short term, " the hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long it's time to take the decision to block arms supplies to the Gaza strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as never before, the best position to persuade Hamas recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967, taking into account the exchange of the territories, and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
It would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the forthcoming voting in the UN, the result of which may be a recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
Its role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term, he had not presented its own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White house he still demonstrates unwillingness to connect to the solution of this problem.
This is catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in the stability of the middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia came into force the law of generic packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the dangers of Smoking and the image of the affected diseases of the parts of the body contrastly allocated on a dull green boxes that are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice the Australian law on the same type of pack cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and colour design of different brands of the same box sadly-olive color with horrible pictures of affected parts of the body and images of children, the health of which undermined Smoking their parents.
In addition to different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of Smoking, the only difference between batches, permission to move in a mandatory manner with this Sabbath - brand names, which is printed the same small font.
This is the most severe in the world of conditions for registration of the packages of tobacco products.
The Federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this measure is to keep the youth from Smoking, depriving them of the habit of fashion status.
The basis for such a decision on the results of research showing that people who do not started Smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
"It is clear that even at the young age of the children understand the meaning of, who are trying to bring the tobacco companies with the help of package decoration", - explained the Minister of health Tanya Плиберсек, citing a study showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a Princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world share of smokers, so that this change is not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, however, the possibility of the adoption of such measures have been considered and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences different from those who think its initiators", - says Scott MacIntyre, a representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra Ha from a small family company u Import Pty Ltd confirms that demand for cigarette cases, silicone cases, to hide unpleasant picture on the package, grew rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where tried to appeal against this law.
According to Sandra Ha, the company u already sold about six thousand products wholesale trade and expects of the new party.
For us it is good business.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among exactly the part of the population addressed by these measures.
After the adoption in Australia a number of laws that made illegal the television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting activities, as well as prohibiting the sellers of the display of cigarettes in a prominent place, the advertising of tobacco products has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government banned the local companies and web sites to place advertising in the network, but it may not restrict in this foreign sites.
"If you trade in tobacco products and you still had only a small loophole, the idea to promote your product on the Internet you will find very attractive," says Becky Freeman, we investigate the questions of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of the alleged common users in social networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
The question arises - is it really the hands of the average citizen, who so loves Marlboro cigarettes, which did not spare time and energy and made a video, or does it stands for an advertising company?
The Australian branch of the British American Tobacco company claims that the industry is now more interested in adapting to the new rules, than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went so far as to measures such as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: the state claims in the framework of the world trade organization, claiming that the trade was subjected to unjust restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries, with Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Плиберсек, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of making them similar laws on the package.
In 2001, the Canada first introduced compulsory placement of photos, warning about the dangers of Smoking.
It is now generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening of laws considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defiantly not obey innovation.
These pictures I do not hurt.
I just do not pay attention.
"Just выхватываешь cigarette, and hide the pack in his pocket", - explains Victor El Haig, buying cigarettes with a photograph of tumors of the oral cavity on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my little daughter.
James Chairman, head of a shop of tobacco products King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package is added to the complexity of the task of placement of goods on shelves
"Before I had the unloading of the new party one hour, and now, four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and altogether ban cigarettes, then we could say: what do we do, well, it's over, close the shop," says he, throwing his hands up.
Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it's not so bad.
This thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane was revealed mechanical problem and it was replaced by another aircraft, which the we and were waiting for.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
Half a day in the airport waiting for a flight - this is really boring, and there is not much help either books or magazines, or iPhone, or even the duty-free shops.
However, in recent years more and more scientists and specialists on child development were in favour of boredom.
They say, that in certain situations for us and for our children will not be bored so bad.
This forces the brain distracted by the interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity.
And because in today's world we all are continually before some screen, the advantages of boredom pass us by.
May be we need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to this.
Before I, like many others, felt that boredom is the invention of a relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not so, argues Peter Toon, Professor of Greek and Roman history of the canadian University of calgary, and is the author of the Fascinating history of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history", - he says.
On the walls in Pompeii were found Latin inscriptions of boredom, Dating from the first century.
This leaves open the question of how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, says John D.. Eastwood, adjunct Professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the boredom often changed.
Having studied the materials of the research on this topic and question the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom - this is when people "want, but cannot deal that would give them the satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that bored people are not doing something that I would like to do.
With apathy do anything you do not want.
The main facing boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in the mood and the feeling that time runs slowly."
On the description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that in spite of a possible connection between these States, bored people see the cause of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, they see a problem in itself.
Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we just difficult to something to focus on.
In his study of "Idle mind: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, the participants listened to a recording of voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard a loud sound is not relevant to the case of the television program, included in the next room, others have heard the same sound at a low volume, so that they can just barely be made out, and the third group only listened to a voice recording without the sound track.
Those participants, who have heard the TV with a low level of volume, noted that they were bored, more often than the others - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to concentrate on challenging or exciting task, interrupt attention may cause boredom, says mark J.. Фенске, associate Professor of neurology at the University of Гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something going on, "for example, looking at the flow of items on the Assembly line in the search of marriage, diverting music can help avoid boredom".
It is considered, he continues, that when people begin to sway in the chair or doodling on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions simply help you not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who do not prohibit the sway and turn round, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require sit still," says Professor Фенске.
In some moments we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching interesting movie.
However, different people have shown varying degrees of inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s, for the measurement of such individual characteristics, the researchers developed a special "scale propensity to boredom".
To evaluate on such a scale is used questions and approval of, for example, "Much of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonically" or "Me too much interesting, so anything is missing time."
With the help of such questionnaires the researchers determined that the boys are bored more often than girls, " said Steven Воданович, a Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly in the presence of various external stimuli.
However, in General, adolescents are often missed.
In 1991. Reed Larson, Professor of the personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, during which he was associated with a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He obtained the following results: 32% of young people declared that they get bored in school and during homework, and 23% said that they get bored outside of the school.
While only 3% of the parents indicated that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that it does not have data about what would be similar data about the boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "in adolescence is the peak of the propensity to boredom", mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to fully solve than they do.
Back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes not, because of the extreme manifestations of it, as studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, the risk of gambling or the abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of the boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, " says Professor Воданович, who devoted to the study of this problem for over two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; this is boring," says Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at new York University.
However, the brain doesn't always know what exactly it is better to do.
If you will be bored and you will direct this energy to play the guitar or the culinary experiments, you make yourself better.
However, if you are watching TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, it will no longer be bored, but he does not learn to fight boredom independently or as otherwise manage your time and employment, " says Professor Фенске.
"And these are the skills of self-regulation are utilized in the most different situations," he says.
Your child learns to not only occupy yourself with something, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think that boredom has to be praised.
However, consider it as something bad is not worth it.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside of a continuous flow of action and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agree with this.
"We see this so that we should more often be bored with the fact that boredom is extremely unpleasant, неутолимое desire to do something meaningful", - he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnected from the constant worries and just relax.
"In the modern world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses, " he says, " and when there is silence, we get lost and do not know what to do".
While it is unclear how it will be applied the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, nineteen-year-old player of the football team and the student community College in the South-East of the state of Colorado accused of committing criminal offenses in the fact that soon there will be absolutely legally on the territory of the state: the storage of a small portion of marijuana and tubes, in which it smoked.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September he and his friends was in Lamare and rode in the car on the Prairie near the border with Kansas, where they were stopped by the police.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for drug possession and possession of equipment for drug - minor offences, for each of which is owed to a fine in the amount of $ 100 - and fixed the date of the court session.
"We are treated like criminals", - says Mr. Orozco.
But the offender does it?
As a result of uncertainty, which has continued for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law as from the place of consideration.
The charges in the minor offences associated with marijuana, is already removed in the hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have ceased to press charges people at the age of 21 years and older for the storage of small doses, which will be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law will come into force.
However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to consider the existing cases, associated with marijuana, and still prosecuted for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West vote for it, to prevent it in their places of new, state-licensed shops for sale of marijuana.
"All this is developing so fast that I didn't know what to expect next," says Daniel J.. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the East of Denver.
Representatives of controlling bodies in the state of Washington also puzzled scratching their heads.
They have to create rules to determine the order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this should be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that, Colorado, is this good or bad, is ahead of most other States in resolving the issues of the use of marijuana, the first in the medical purposes, and now for the fun of.
"In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example", " explains Brian. Smith, a representative of the Council for the regulation of the production and marketing of alcoholic products in the state of Washington.
But now no-one can do more, recognizes Mr. Smith, than to put forward some proposals, and I hope that this will work.
"We have no real precedent on which we could focus", - he says.
The bill of the state of Washington, called the I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and for the whole year will plunge the state into a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing of yet, but the right of possession of marijuana is legalized.
And there are in fact more complicated technical aspects, which need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between the order of the state of "adequate" access to a covered marijuana with a ban on the trade at a distance of 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergarten.
"Particularly difficult to place a licensed enterprise on trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs", " explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group "the Center of the legalization of marijuana".
on November 21, the chief of police Oates from the Aurora sent his subordinates to an e-mail message that the Prosecutor's office of the city will no longer attract persons under the age of 21 years, to liability for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops incriminate people in these violations "from this moment".
The chief of police Oates said that the police will monitor the observance of the city of rules regulating the activity of the persons, who have been growing marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug dealers.
The district attorney Weald in the North of Colorado, Ken Tank, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the Prosecutor's office will continue to attract the responsibility for marijuana possession, mainly in order to encourage the use of its individuals undergo a course of treatment.
At the moment 119 persons charged with possession of two and less than ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and to other violations.
"The duty of our institutions - be prosecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the moment of their execution", - said Mr. Tank in a statement.
Reaction was mixed, even in places such as rural district Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal by the legalization of marijuana.
The police Grand junction, the largest city in the County, was no longer attractive to the responsibility of adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
The district attorney Pete Хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges and in the cases associated with the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that ensure the compliance with the law, until he will not change is our direct duty", - he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, who took part in the voting, have supported this decision, the inclusion of questions about the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.
A contradictory reaction of inhabitants in different places of the state highlighted the ambiguity of the relationship of the local authorities to experiment a state with marijuana.
"The district attorneys in this matter there is a cultural barrier", " explains Sean McAllister, Denver lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National organization for reform of the laws on marijuana.
"They have long pursued the people behind this is that now cannot really accept the fact that it is not a crime", - he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first States in which a small quantity of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of the legalization and officials of the state plan to enlarge the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time, they anxiously await instructions from the Federal authorities, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a Federal crime.
Supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of justice of the yield in this matter.
Despite several have received a wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who use marijuana for medical reasons, the Federal government in the majority of cases, gave the nod to the trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
Agents of the Bureau on struggle with drug is unlikely to be breaking into homes to confiscate small bag of marijuana, but they hardly will turn a blind eye on regulated by the authorities of the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, believes Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some of the city in Colorado not wait for the actions of the Federal authorities.
Even before the presidential elections, some of the local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, who are not able to open earlier than in a year.
Last week Монтроуз, a town in the Western part of the state, put forward for the consideration of the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which, most likely, will be approved at the next week.
"We don't want to be in a position that we will give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the Federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city Council.
Our city has voted against the amendment.
And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and thus, for which voted the state.
There is still a great many unresolved issues.
Петронелла Уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I am a conservative.
Persecution of students from universities for their opinions began not today.
As long as I can remember, I always wanted to do in the University of Oxford.
My father and elder brother had studied at Oxford and have described it as the best institution in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient Symposium, закладывающий two of the foundations of civilization - free-thinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the faculty of history at Worcester College, Oxford University in the late eighties, I Packed my bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father broke down and wept.
Friends were confused.
Newspaper The Evening Standard said that I dropped out of College because I didn't like that my classmates are having sex in the next room.
The Writer Of E. Wilson joked that I went, because I had to drink from the chipped cups.
In fact, everything was not so funny.
I ran away.
Yes, ran away, because I systematically persecuted and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
All men have hunted me for only one reason, and in this the famous cradle of enlightenment it looked like this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Уайэтт, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the conservatives.
You ask, why talk about it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, adhering to center-right views, is subject to the same persecution.
This institutionalized and continuously growing hatred of the students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong, that last week a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that which is provided to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives from the students ' club of the College of Corpus Christi in Cambridge claim that they "are often very isolated and subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwelcome guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter in the Committee on equal rights of the College of additional representative, to ensure the freedom of expression.
Their situation only worsened the recently released on BBC 2 documentary film about the policy in the student's environment "Country of miracles: young, intelligent and right", in which the conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe cook, former President of the Association of conservatives, University of Oxford, who goes around in a rolls-Royce, is a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
In other universities, students-conservatives complain that it is being made a "scapegoat because of the increase of fees for study".
Luke black, 20 years old, the Vice-President of the Association of conservatives, University of Nottingham, in an interview to one of the Sunday Newspapers said that "in the University environment increases the bias in favor of the left-wing views.
People who we don't even know in advance we are arrogant and with impunity rowdy children of wealthy parents".
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student of the historical faculty of the College of Corpus Christi, which had filed a petition for protection, calls this atmosphere of "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Черилл, 19 years, the new President of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club of the media center-right views deteriorated significantly.
"This constitutes a threat as for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and just for the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one.
I went there in September 1986, timid and shy eighteen year old girl.
Oxford fever from hatred of the conservative party.
For the year to the University of voting deprived former student of Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree from the budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.
In the early days of the week of freshman, when the students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time, what was waiting for me ahead.
I did not know that the teachers are not only looking through your fingers to the persecution of students-conservatives, but also yourself with pleasure took part in it.
Political issues - the miners ' strike, the privatization and disagreement of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa is penetrated the trimmed with wood-paneled walls audiences.
On my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century the English, and I was not ready to the fact that followed it.
"Miss Уайэтт, " said the teacher, the late Harry pitt, " please, turn first paragraph".
The text given to me with difficulty, I stammered.
Harry pitt was a very bitter man with a face like a cake.
"Тэтчеристы fundamentally do not learn French or they simply did not have enough brains?" "he asked.
The other students laughed.
I have brought tears to his eyes.
"I advise You to take some initial lessons of the French in your free time, if You will, of course, not very busy, away from the society", - said the voice testily pitt.
I returned to my room, quite miserable.
In the evening in the College, I was sitting at dinner one; then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a student of the second course of the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University.
"I know who you are, " he said pleasantly.
"Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
over every person suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives, will scoff.
I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more complicated.
The majority of first-year students-conservatives pretending they labour".
Later, in the local pub, I timidly tried to play the hypocrite.
I insisted that he does not agree with all that said Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
First-year student of the faculty of philosophy, politics and Economics, who himself was educated at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious".
Other students took up his words.
I was damaged, dirty.
"How conservatives have sex? "One of them asked.
"They beat each other, right?"
I felt as should be, feel homosexuals to abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become лейбористкой and hide their true beliefs?
The upcoming me three years were hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my College, spared his conservative views, was Norman stone, Professor of modern history.
He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher on the issues of foreign policy and one of its speech writers.
In College, he practically did not appear.
He despised him for provincialism, pettiness and commitment to Marxist-deterministic view of the story.
In 1997 he accepted a professorial position at the University of Билкент in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy", - he said to me.
I began to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased view of the capital's friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He did not believe me.
During his training in the forties were adopted there any political views.
"But this is the best University in the world, " he said plaintively.
- There are not capable of, not only in the city of dreaming spires...
Even my friends-the Communists had always behaved perfectly".
His moist eyes clouded.
"Don't take hasty decisions.
I'm sure this is just a joke.
You break my heart, if you drop the University".
I was exhausted constant trips to London and my emotional protection of the weak.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and refused from their beliefs.
Next week during the seminar, when the history teacher was seriously called me a "public enemy", I decided to do the same.
In the soul burning with shame, I admitted that "I brainwashed parents", and called them "the old fool".
The respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At that time it every week wrote to two columns for publications, owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not go out, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered.
When they were gone, I Packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me плаксой and cloth.
But in eighteen years, no one should be subject to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only has released fourteen of the Prime Ministers of the tories, but to this day, hiding the undeserved reputation of the University in which the value of equality and freedom of thought.

Princess and a fashion Патрициа della Джовампаола d"Arenberg, too, can't forget the first time dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I will be the age and reason for you to wear one of his evening dresses...
Finally the hour has come at the end of the 90-ies.
I bought my first dress from Valentino, to put him at the feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with skirts with ruffles, "bodice" in the fold and cut strapless.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow Rodrigo d"Аренберга.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless", - explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, new York and Buenos Aires.

The "king" of fashion
Grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset house wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Павлосом of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work, and 25 "girls" (as the designer of their seamstresses), to make this dress of silk ivory inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a train in the four and a half meters.
According to the journalist suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of the high fashion of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the upper light".
Besotted with many years of "life style" of the elite, now Valentino himself is the representative.
Knight Grand cross (the badge of honour of the high rank in Italy), the Cavalier of labour, commander of the order of Arts and literature, was awarded the medal of the Legion of Honor, Garavani gathered as much honor, how much of any of the spouses of its clients.
"Always, my attention was attracted by its refinement, its calm, its a neat and clean appearance," recalls Dr."Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at the ceremonial dinner in the Museum d'orsay.
He sat at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Wadden, my great friend.
"He was talking about, time does not exist for him."
If it says Princess...
The hardest profession in the world: the miners with Qavah-Иджена
For four Euro Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, hauling 70 kilograms of sulfur at the top of the volcano on the steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them Анто Vijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living extraction of sulfur in the volcano Qavah-Иджен, located in the East of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Анто down to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens in contact with air.
Breaking off a huge chunks of sulphur, total weight of which can reach up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on his shoulders and carries them up the steep stony road.
Up to the top of the volcano, the height of which is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted the laborers are required more than 40 minutes to get up at a snail's pace, with difficulty keeping balance and carefully picking a way to not trip and fall over a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their life, as it happened with one tourist from France, which collapsed a few years ago from the rocks Qavah-Иджена.
The miners with Qavah-Иджена earn 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulphur, which is
Once on top, they are paving their way among the tourists that they are photographed, as if they were apes from the circus, and, tired of carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
It is about SA Kandy Нгримби, the company, which operates since 1960, the volcano, and it is better not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for around 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) petrochemical industries, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar.
"As the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each separate raids", " explains us Анто, which usually carries out three daily carrying.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels shattered, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 Euro) to the end of the day.
Although it seems мизером for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"Daily wage miners is very high by local standards, where for the collection of coffee pay of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 EUR) ", - explains the porter, who had previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75.000 rupees (6,2 Euro) per day, and the plot was not so heavy, but Анто returned with his family in Баньюванги, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some of the Hindus, and brought her to Java, so she accepted Islam".
The Анто asthma, he breathed with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes from the toxic gases
In his 27 years Анто spent three years, risking themselves in Qavah-Иджене, sulfur which has already begun to affect him in spite of the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathed with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes from the toxic gases, which allocates the volcano.
That is the price he must pay for the accomplishment of your dreams.
"Work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French", - he promises to more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or the Concierge at the hotel, but instead, he performs the work of a mule.
Sharing dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock, because sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns to blue and shines in darkness.
To challenge the shadows, Анто down into the crater, lighting up their way a little lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry the basket of gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profit, the mining company has not механизировала production of sulfur for cost savings and does not provide any equipment porters, who are working at their own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not receive even a part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) fee for photography, which, together with the entrance ticket for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of the reserve charged to tourists, who come to take photos of the volcano and its people-mules.
"This work for the cattle, and not for the people," says Бадрусин, a porter 42 years old, who spent at Qavah-Иджене three decades, ever since I left College.
Capable to carry up to 110 kilograms, he assures that will endure work "as much as he can," because he needed the money for the education of their three children at the age from 18 to 10 years.
Not going to retire, die here, because the volcano is all my life
Although the sulfur burns my throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the solid pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their habitual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on his shoulders, which buckled under the weight of baskets.
Balancing a basket on his back, Унайник now only can lift 50 pounds in its 53-year-old.
Every day he and his comrades make 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transported to a warehouse in Тамансари, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers down the narrow path among the thickets.
"Not going to retire, die here, because the volcano is all my life," says Унайник, mouth wide open, which is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, is also carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation one of the most difficult lessons in the world: what do human mules with Qavah-Иджена.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans are accused career, stress, and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore, should grow up".
My husband is a patriot, you are my wife so she's Patriotic, fulfill our civil duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising peppermints, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of this - this video has been a big hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses the local sayings like "Let's put Bao (roll) in the stove", to laugh at the level of birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising Agency, which has made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to attract attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative Director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of the music that people have fulfilled "its national debt."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world for the reproduction of their own kind, so we felt that this is a topic that we need to address.
We knew that the government attempted to do a lot of things, such as the launching of perfume with pheromones or organize a party of fast Dating (blitz-Dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, but it is compose rap?
1,2 child
Who does not take it so lightly, so that the government of Singapore.
It spends of 1,300 us dollars a year on the policy for encouragement of citizens to the birth of more children.
The state package for couples and parents provides to 15,000 dollars for a child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all this is of low efficiency.
Singapore - it is a rich and high-tech state-city in South-East Asia, also known conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national office for the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, Director of the policy for couples and families the National authority for the population, says that the reason for the "better education" and "over a wide range of career opportunities".
"This allowed people to have a more wide range of options in regard to the life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and creating a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of bachelors and postponing marriage and the birth of children, as a result of which decreased the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is directed to a sharp increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population, causes resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are web sites where commercial barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, which criticized for the maintenance of wages at a low level and a reluctance to integrate.
Growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in the elections since independence.
After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While a falling birth rate exerts a certain influence on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, costs for medicine and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making effort to be built so many small housing.
For example, it's beginning to affect the real estate sector.
Guide urban development passed to control the number of small apartments, known as the "Shoe box", which can be build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments an area of 46 square meters are sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion, that they may contribute to the single way of life and deprive incentive developers who want to build a large family housing.
But lim Yu Xun, Director General of the house of the company EL Developers, says that their "Shoe boxes" are sold much more quickly than the more spacious instances.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are sold in a few days, even weeks, faster than the apartment size.
As a result of that, our cash flows are increasing.
Nevertheless, he admits that the new regulations provide more explicit guidance for developers, who had put obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too перенапряженные
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules can be a step in the direction of increase in the national birth rate, after a conversation with сингапурцами who work in the financial district of the centre, it seems that they will have no effect.
"People are very перенапряжены, housing is expensive, as well as the formation, and because of this, many people are postponed", - says a young Manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mention his career, stress, and prices for housing and education as the main reasons, which prevent them from having children.
So, how would the government or tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, in regard to the birth, the last word remains for the сингапурцами.
Personal offline personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is on the property of private or "the sphere of personal life, which have the right to defend from any interference."
That is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
As he apply this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks?
Whether he understood the danger, which is under discussion in the Internet situations, which certainly would not have shared outside of the Internet?
elPeriódico conducted an interview with five children from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associate the term with "something very, my", in his personal plane, and "name and password of the user", when applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I would not uploaded in the post", - says the ten-year Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of the personal on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has records for two years.
"This is a very secret of secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world", - he says.
On FB I download beautiful pictures or images from the games.
I'm also having a good time with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photo which is not mine, or someone who behaves ridiculous," he says.
The boy realizes that bad publish obscene pictures of naked people, crime or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says that knows 35 friends, which he had in FB, and nine of their фолловеров in Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
Mother in the course, it has a password to one of the accounts.
I started my Twitter to Express himself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know whether I, I only their load," he adds.
"Social networks, entertainment, I can talk with distant relatives or with your friends-quick", - he points out.
Without thinking, responsible, that never would have accepted a request from an unknown person.
I would not be with someone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose different.
The teenager has open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits he doesn't know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he said.
According to the boy, no one to him not втирался in confidence and not asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I will pressure or demand, simply remove them from your account", - he admits.
Jose became a follower of the Ask after reading the recommendations in Twitter.
The boy is not a stranger to the experience of what is today known as кибермоббинг.
An acquaintance of my friend being blackmailed by the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, not deleted the account.
"Only turned on confidentiality".
Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up your account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy uploaded the photos would acquaintances in inconvenient or confusing situations.
Yes, I would do it if the person I don't like it or if I like it.
"Although I know that this кибермоббинг", - confirms it.
Key questions
Марьелос Поррас, teacher of English and a specialist in education and training, considers that, in order to guide children and teenagers need to understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet was introduced as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game", - she said.
Поррас indicates that the academician of the mark Пренски, master of pedagogy of Yale University and is the author of Digital natives and immigrants, invented the terms for an explanation of this phenomenon.
Digital natives it is they, the children and young people, who were born in the era of technology.
"We are digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still do learn," she says.
Explains that this issue is a complex one, "because we have them we ask you to have a certain criteria that may or may not distribute, publish or speak, at an age when puberty is not enough for this".
"Also that they were selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what the confidentiality of children and adolescents, " to ask questions, which make them think.
"Say to them that they did not do this, it is useless," she adds.
Then Поррас lists some of the options: there are things that you hadn't told the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or, would you like it if published a photo you like the one that posted about you his friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign a photo with the parties, asking whether you permission from other people, to celebrate them?
And another thing, does everybody need to know what you're doing at every moment?
One more point is to let them understand that they should conduct themselves online as well as doing it offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside of the Internet the person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, so shall it be in social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Эстуардо splendid beach, a University lecturer, Professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for the heads of the families in good faith reading of the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons to talk with children about the background of the opening of account in the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish," says he.
According to Гаурдия, the key question is to remind children a lesson "don't talk to strangers".
(UNASUR) summit ends without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration
VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was completed today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, the previously announced and in theory signed by the family of compulsory participants.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to obtain access to the document, signed at the sixth regular meeting of the heads of state and government of the UNASUR, however, sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page, which it handed over after the closing, but then confirmed, that at some point he will be published on the web site of the Peruvian government.
On the questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was stated by the President of Peru, Ольянта Умала, during the brief statements for the press.
Journalists ' access to information about the Summit was all the time limited.
During the day only was broadcasted, in the hall for the press, video presidential Assembly without sound with the message "closed meeting, the sound is prohibited".
A little information, which circulated among the reporters, was transferred to the press-secretaries of some governments (UNASUR), present at the meeting, however, not Peruvian.

Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an email message to the media with "the final Declaration of the summit, however, it is all about the statement of Умалы, and not on the official document, which culminated in the summit.
In the past October Peru hosted the III Summit of South American and Arab countries (АСПА), and in that time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded the press, too, has not been published so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced.
At the official web-site of the АСПА, you can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.

The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Дилмы Русеф; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, membership of which in the UNASUR was suspended from 2011, after his impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.

He said that action was being taken to improve the cooperation in the fight against insecurity of citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, cost-effective Internet access in all parts of South America and taking into account the total and effective manner, the risks of natural disasters".
Since Europe is in a crisis, "economic Association (Latin America) should not be триумфаторской basis, and shall serve for the expansion of our manufacturing base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Умала.
"We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 important projects, which will improve the communication spaces of South America, in particular in rural and border areas... bringing our countries and forming new economic schemes," said Peruvian President to read the message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that the five refer to Peru, and limited transverse axes in its territory, from coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at larger relationship with Ecuador, however, he did not give more details.
The outcome document touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations", from which it currently excluded.
The need to Latin America remain a region of well-being and the world would be United, and had good relations between neighbours, was another topic, emphasized by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before proceeding to participate in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico city for negotiations in good form on the Maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court of justice, contested in Bogota.

"South America should learn from Europe in terms of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, Yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, said state television Peru, that the Europeans killed each other during the Second world war and other conflicts, "but now they are essentially the same Fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project for the South American citizenship, which approves of the countries-participants (UNASUR).
"You need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers on any South American country, as is already happening with the members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sector who want to return us to the past", - he said.
Ecuadorian President showed himself, in addition, the proponent of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the impact of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account of those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who read lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South American, on the contrary, sign all.
"Inexplicable that the inter-American Commission on human rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum, the Ecuador founder of WikiLeaks Julian Ассанжу.
Correa assured that they do not regret this decision, because he never betrayed his principles and comply with the "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that in his time "there were some suspicions that the Assange be extradited to a third country and will not be observed process".
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about an alleged crime of sexual violence, while "the Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it by means of video conferencing, which can be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health Assange.
"I have not talked to him since he arrived in our Embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a little pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
That really is, is a danger of deterioration in his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do the exercises in the air.
"It affects the health of any individual," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution of the problems of asylum, as provided by Ассанжу from June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of guarantees of immunity to allow him to go in Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial bodies and stressed that the negotiations were in London on the search for solution of the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights, the word in this case we do not use, but there were constant discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial organs, because the lawyer Assange, Balthazar Garzon, conducts a number of processes in the different European institutions", - he mentioned.
And expressed the opinion that "if Britain tomorrow give a guarantee of immunity, it will end".
And if the USA, as her perfectly to the legislation and as it has done in other cases, ask them Senora Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or to interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as the defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies, which distort the freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of press freedom is not spoiled by the villains policy, and bad journalists, supporting the bait, blackmail and extortion", - he said.
In this aspect he was pleased with that have neither of these journalists, "neither banks, nor bourgeois countries-hegemons not prevail in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "deepen the revolution to continue the development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and do not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the guise of legality"because, in reality, "it has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
Ecuadorian President considered, in addition, a "perfectly reasonable" the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos conduct talks now with Nicaragua on the Maritime boundary between the two countries after the decision of the International court of justice at the Hague, which was in favor of the Nicaraguan Maritime sovereignty.
At the moment this decision is not complied with.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they should be overcome desire to go together.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and to continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good ending a dispute concerning the Maritime boundary, which lead to the same court, Peru and Chile, and has stated that "the right to Latin America to appeal to international courts, if the two countries agree to take a decision, no matter how difficult it might be.
About the opportunity to speak as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it's pretty hard."
Correa has assured, that if defeated in the elections in February 2013, they'll get away from public life.
On a personal level I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by the political authorities.
"My political movement considered, what exactly am I guaranteed that the probable victory, so you have to accept the responsibility," he said.
In case of a victory that would have been my last term in office of the President, and then we go out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This decision", - he said.
Correa also mention the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to therapy, which had already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that it will campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean aggravation of the health condition of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state has participated today in Lima in the VI summit of heads of States and governments of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he announced that his analysis of the AIDS gave a positive result.
"I was stunned," - he recalls the difficult, in spite of all the tact of a doctor, the moment.
The young man kept it secret from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And its efforts are justified he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest patients HIV-branches of the hospital, the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) since 22 years. In the beginning of 90-ies it would be hard to believe - too little then exist treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased attitude to the patients.
So, even the Director of the Mexican Institute of social security did not want to say good-bye to him, "for he was cut".
In other words, in those times have AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive in this syndrome and to do this without compromising the quality of life.
However, not knowing about his illness, are still many people come, when the virus has already caused the damage, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first of the cases, "a great achievement at the moment is the fact that the survival of the patient, who began treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in the same", - said the head of the HIV-office HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information has been confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease specialist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists came to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, however, the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, the better the life expectancy of those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years with a total number of 200 CD4 + t-cells, and up to 50 years, when informed of the 500 CD4 + t-cells.
Simply put, this means that the one who gets the diagnosis of a HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "maintaining control, to be able to live without any problems up to 75 years", - he explained.
To evaluate this progress, it should be recalled that the duration of life of Mexicans today is at an average of 76 years.
While the mortality rate has decreased considerably in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of the UNAIDS), it is also true that from the moment of the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in a national database died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by may of this year; however, it is submitted that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs by 2005.
- Why there are still lethal outcomes?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I see it, this is the case in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have not been a lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected state, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating to: "Nine out of ten patients come when already have some opportunistic infections; what you need to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so it is diagnosed at an early stage, and therefore it is necessary to submit samples for the detection of on a massive scale, for all the people who are asked to".
In its proposal converge in opinion of experts and officials of the State Council on the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check in a private laboratory, побужденный only the fact that it was a friend of his, and in spite of his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that they will die, and did not want to know.
"Time will still die, I will be better надираться three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do the exercises, take pills.
Today, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I'm travelling, lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of myself and other people", - enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal lives with MILENIO, JALISCO, to coerce his statement of those who now, in the context of the world AIDS day, feels fear.
Let checked if there was a risk of intrusion, he shall as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV-positive, so much the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other people, being responsible.
This is his message sums up the theme of fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Female condom over the counter
Great abyss between programmes in the field of health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara, who tackled the problem, related to HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places, devoted to this task, "in fact increased female condom provision, before we were given one or two, we now offer packages at one hundred, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still does not have access to презервативу", - he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why would you need them?" this is a popular question, with malice and condemnation on the part of social workers, school counselors, staff of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I suggest to change the inefficient distribution; order female condom were not only behind the counters and to a hundred of them was in the vending machines in the public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This does not encourage promiscuity.
We are not talking about paying for the beer and the Motel, said the Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when he was asked whether it is possible distribution of презервативов with his leadership.
"It's not sexy, it is best to make the female condom available for those who already practice of sexual activity", - he noted.
Key data in Jalisco
Registered 13,435 of total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state takes the 4th place in the national ranking under the new and the total cases of AIDS and 13-e by HIV.
92% of infections are related to sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% to the perinatal way.
An estimated 50 thousand people can live with HIV, so as on the one registered case there are from 4 to 5 people, who do not know about it.
Considering the ratification of the court of appeal of the United States decisions, which Annuls the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro achieved by means of competitive production in Mexico, the script installs the fatal precedent for any national companies with branch offices in the neighbouring country, which has problems with solvency.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms, which are permitted by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In the practical sphere, approval of a decision by June 15 the judge Харлин Hale in the court of bankruptcy of the Northern district of Texas, leaves helpless Mexican firm in the face of possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the resolution opens the door leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for the appeal to the Supreme court of the United States, citing the evidence of the three inconsistency.
As of entry, at the same time as the judge of the case notes that the creditors should be governed by the Code of the United States bankruptcy, the court of Appeals fifth circuit, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concerns of competitive production, the in Mexico.
The first point implies the cancellation of an international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact, with this purpose was created by the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, defining as an arbitrator in the American law Institute.
Secondly, the verdict States that, without interenterprise voting, recognized the critical mass of competitive production of the debt that had been before the parent company of the subsidiaries of Vitro, could not be attained majority required for approval of the restructuring.
However, the ability to recognize the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when taken this scheme.
There were half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive productions.
It is also true that by subtracting the voice of the branches, one way or another lenders Vitro, which fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely funds "vultures" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37.
These data the court of Appeal declined.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro in a difficult situation, with which she faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis, which overtook the United States, striking at the country.
While the firm family Gonzalez Garden produces the appeal of the decision in the court of appeal, to the vote came to the plenary meeting, that is, five judges, in view of the fact that voted only three.
In the case of a failure of will be presented the petition on the document, which will require a revision of the process of the court of higher jurisdiction, in this case, the Supreme court of the United States.
Even worse is the fact that the court rejected the document, directed the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), in which is described the process, which should be Vitro in the framework of the Law of competitive industries, indicating that he frees himself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it with article 15 of the us bankruptcy.
In addition, it is noted that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that is, the rules established for the cases of inter-state of insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carom from two sides: they beat in Vitro and beat in the country.

Hector "Хетин" Reyes: "Basketball is my life"
An avid basketball traveler Hector "Хетин" Reyes was more than 60 years is connected with the sport and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "Хетин" Reyes.
And as before, the hemorrhage in a brain tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the Highest basketball League, the Commissioner and the head of taking the Cowboys Баямона and the President of the basketball Federation.
"I have done a lot of roles in the game of basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, like when I was President of the taking, Director General of the National team and the President of the Federation in the 90-ies," recalls Reyes during the visit of the Primera Hora to his home in Баямон, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia from his long journey, testify to this.
Баямон in the heart of the
With the largest emotions he keeps those that remember his way through the Cowboys, since the middle of 50-ies as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years his speech on the role of co-agent or agent of the contract.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most of all, because he had the opportunity to be part of the eight Championships Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, the co-agent or supervisor.
There were many years of joy, including five Championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to the one in 1981, in a year's debut Jerome Минси in taking.
The time and continue to lead became "cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator", " said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Бартов, who was here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I Have for you is a very strong player, growth of 6'7".
"Do you want to?"
And this was the beginning of Минси, one of the best players that were in Puerto Rico.
Бартов then recommend sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember that I said that if Минси brought the championship Баямону, Gauss would have helped to win another one.
The championship Cowboys with Gauss I enjoyed, but already at a distance, because by 1988, was listed head of the Federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements Минси in the national team.
Remember, as we won the first time, in the us at the time of the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world championship 1990, on which we received the fourth place and it should be a bronze, if it were not for the canadian judge, which has forced us to beat the final game, said Reyes.
The team with the 1990 FIFA world - this is the best team, you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the Olympic games of 2004.
But my favorite was the one that with the pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and beat team USA, which was quite similar to that we have won bronze at the world championship.
In the team not only were playing again Минси, Gauss, Ramona Риваса, Fico Lopez and 'Пикулина' (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) 'Тоньито' colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us gold medal and great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament 1995, in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-players like 'Канито' Ньевеса, Pablo Алисеа and young Rolando Хурруитнера instead of players suspended for the mess in the pan-American championship in Mar del Plata, we won the gold in spite of all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Пикулин Ortiz.
His performance on the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico is not dominated at this level as it did Пикулин.
And this is without accounting of his career in a variety of leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best leader of the Puerto Rican kid?
This is a very complicated question.
We had a very good young, including Julio Toro, flora Мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond Далмау, Армандито Torres.
From young, I really like the work of Leo Ариллы.
What do you think is your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that, in the beginning of 90-ies in taking was to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were some things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalisation of the smaller categories.
For example, to see the boys from Ponce only played in their area, and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessary.
At least, I see the fruits of obligatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch music videos my time on YouTube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally go to the basketball matches.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always with me.
Dead actor Larry Хэгмэн
Larry Хэгмэн, born on September 21, 1931, in the Fort worth (Texas), became world-famous due to its leading role as John Ross sarcoma, better known as "J.R.", the in the TV series "Dallas", in which he embodied the businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Хэгмэн, whose role of oil magnate-the predator Jay Ar sarcoma in the TV series "Dallas" became the symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Хэгмэн, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of "Dallas", died on Friday in the evening because of the complications caused by cancer, according to the statement of the family, provided to The Associated Press the company Warner Bros., Studio production of "Dallas".
"Larry again returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing a significant role, which most of all he liked," said his family.
The family of Larry and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the fair in honour of the Day of thanksgiving.
Linda gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to the Хэгмэном, when he died in the hospital of Dallas, said its spokesman Jeffrey lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will really miss him.
"He was the original person and have lived a full life", - confirmed gray in a statement.
The Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he acknowledged that he was drinking in the course of many years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor of the liver and he underwent transplantation.
Long before the "Dallas", Хэгмэн became famous on television due to the role of a decent type in a light Comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast over the radio channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played captain Tony Nelson, astronaut, whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl as she plays Barbara Eden, and begins to live with him under one roof.
He was also the main character of the two comedies, who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included the role of, well received by the critics as "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his workshop interpretation of deliciously nasty J.R. led Hagman to the top of the fame.
Drama series CBS about the clan Юингов and other people in his entourage went on the air in April 1978 to may 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", conceived to create a sensation around the scene, full of emotions, in which the character Hagman nearly killed, has given rise to international discussion and millions of dollars, which risked in the bookmakers.
Also it helped bring to the series the largest audience in that time.
When the answer was in the episode from November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched him, and turned the "Dallas" in the second according to the number of views of the entertainment program in history, after the finale of "MASH" in 1983, attracted 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law J.R., Christine (played by Mary Crosby), which shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her with that accuse her in prostitution, if it is not out of the city, but others also had reason to attack him.
Хэгмэн played sarcoma as insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and philandering husband who wants his wife alcoholic, sue Ellen (Linda gray), placed on treatment.
"I know it should be on the gravestone J.R.", the - said Хэгмэн in 1988.
Has to be said: "Here lies an honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal, which he lost.
Victoria Принсипал, also a heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "great, both on the inside and outside of the screen".
It is unforgettable and is indispensable for the millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who had the pleasure to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
Was already finished the recording of the five episodes of the second season and the sixth was in production, told the channel.
Warner or TNT is not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after the departure of the Hagman.
A native of Fort worth, Texas, he was the son of an actress and a singer Mary Martin, which shone in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager, when she bore him in 1931, during his marriage to a lawyer Ben Хэгмэном.
He tried happiness in the theatrical scenes of new York in the early 1950s, and then served in the air force Britain from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met with a young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the California town of Malibu, where there are many celebrities.
In 2001, he called my memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything there that it would be able to hurt anyone or influence them in any way", - he said Prensa Asociada at the time.
After liver transplantation he was to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, to help patients experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they go for an operation, and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, there will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you will be in order."
He also argued strongly against Smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Begins a course that explores the "End of the world"
Each week students explore the apocalyptic events, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when a Professor of religion Stewart Charm decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which caught many people as in the proof of what is to come the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "долгоармагеддоном", and the growing conflict, where retracted Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times believe that the start of the Apocalypse.
"I was not aware that this would be the most apocalyptic semester of them all," said the Charm of this week, the students of the University Rutgers-Camden (new Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we have only 30 days, it was really a good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who have apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only Professor, which offers courses on the theme of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
In Темпльском University adjunct Professor Barry Вакер reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas eventually apply", - he said, and the way that offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain actions of a man.
If the nuclear material will get into the hands of terrorists, for example, can generate a war.
In this month the students analyzed the movies on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they correlate with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students about what is possible, probably, plausible, and it is impossible", - said Вакер.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania Professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Ресталл and his colleague Amara Solari, associate Professor of art history and anthropology, have come together to read the course, which is simply called "the End of the world".
"We do not add '2012', so that you always have the opportunity to read the course again, in the case if the end of the world will not come," said Ресталл.
In spite of the "imminent destruction," students should learn, prepare projects and submit the final examinations.
At Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "to that very night, in which supposedly the end of the world", said Ресталл.
Courses were very popular.
"The place ended in two hours", - said Ресталл about his course for students with a high average score, on which signed up 35 students.
We have received e-mail messages in the course of many weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who are asking, is there another place.
Students, in turn, certify that this course one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to console himself," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the separation of religion and the sociology of Хаддонфилда, new Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the lack of it.
Will Векеса, 25-year-old student of the Department of psychology and nursing, said that watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard about the course, which would have taught it," - he said.
I like it.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the Professor is not said, that he believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project involved the prophecy of the Maya, and in some way we his discredited", - said Julie Зеглен, 21-year-old student of the last course in Темпльском University of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is simply a key moment in the calendar, said Ресталл.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in the Western culture, which dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around him, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people do not think about it", - he said.
In a predominantly English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, Professor of religion University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether, if he knows about any course on the "end of the world" out there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to an order of a higher court.
We have shown from the Pope.
Ресталл noticed that for a long time discussed the many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing is going to happen on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said that they are going to go to a party "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call one of your friends, to laugh together," said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student of the faculty of communication.
